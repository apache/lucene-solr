TODO
  - move DocumentBuilder.build -> FacetsConfig.build
  - add sugar apis to do sort-by-score, sort-by-field sort AND collect into SimpleFacetsCollector?
  - getSpecificValue for a dim isn't reliable
  - we could put more stuff into the "schema", e.g. this field is
    sorted-set-DV and that one is taxo?
  - standardize on facet or facets (e.g. FacetIndexWriter)
  - fewer args when constructing a range
  - how to do avg() agg?
  - test needsScores=true / valuesource associations
  - consistently name things "dimension"? calling these fields is CONFUSING
  - later
    - SSDVValueSourceFacets?
    - add hierarchy to ssdv facets?
    - sparse faceting: allow skipping of certain dims?
