Lucene Change Log
$Id$

NOTE:  In a minor change to Lucene's backward compatibility policy, we are now allowing the Fieldable interface to have
changes, within reason, and made on a case-by-case basis.  If an application implements it's own Fieldable, please be aware
  of this.  Otherwise, no need to be concerned.  For more details see https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-1349.
  This is in effect for all 2.X releases, starting with 2.4.  Also note, that in all likelihood, Fieldable will be changed
  in 3.0.


======================= Trunk (not yet released) =======================

Changes in runtime behavior

 1. LUCENE-1151: Fix StandardAnalyzer to not mis-identify host names
    (eg lucene.apache.org) as an ACRONYM.  To get back to the pre-2.4
    backwards compatible, but buggy, behavior, you can either call
    StandardAnalyzer.setDefaultReplaceInvalidAcronym(false) (static
    method), or, set system property
    org.apache.lucene.analysis.standard.StandardAnalyzer.replaceInvalidAcronym
    to "false" on JVM startup.  All StandardAnalyzer instances created
    after that will then show the pre-2.4 behavior.  Alternatively,
    you can call setReplaceInvalidAcronym(false) to change the
    behavior per instance of StandardAnalyzer.  This backwards
    compatibility will be removed in 3.0 (hardwiring the value to
    true).  (Mike McCandless)

 2. LUCENE-1044: IndexWriter with autoCommit=true now commits (such
    that a reader can see the changes) far less often than it used to.
    Previously, every flush was also a commit.  You can always force a
    commit by calling IndexWriter.commit().  Furthermore, in 3.0,
    autoCommit will be hardwired to false (IndexWriter constructors
    that take an autoCommit argument have been deprecated) (Mike
    McCandless)

API Changes

 1. LUCENE-1084: Changed all IndexWriter constructors to take an
    explicit parameter for maximum field size.  Deprecated all the
    pre-existing constructors; these will be removed in release 3.0.
    (Steven Rowe via Mike McCandless)

 2. LUCENE-584: Changed Filter API to return a DocIdSet instead of a
    java.util.BitSet. This allows using more efficient data structures
    for Filters and makes them more flexible. This deprecates
    Filter.bits(), so all filters that implement this outside
    the Lucene code base will need to be adapted. See also the javadocs
    of the Filter class. (Paul Elschot, Michael Busch)

 3. LUCENE-1044: Added IndexWriter.commit() which flushes any buffered
    adds/deletes and then commits a new segments file so readers will
    see the changes.  Deprecate IndexWriter.flush() in favor of
    IndexWriter.commit().  (Mike McCandless)

 4. LUCENE-325: Added IndexWriter.expungeDeletes methods, which
    consult the MergePolicy to find merges necessary to merge away all
    deletes from the index.  This should be a somewhat lower cost
    operation than optimize.  (John Wang via Mike McCandless)

 5. LUCENE-1233: Return empty array instead of null when no fields
    match the specified name in these methods in Document:
    getFieldables, getFields, getValues, getBinaryValues.  (Stefan
    Trcek vai Mike McCandless)

 6. LUCENE-1234: Make BoostingSpanScorer protected.  (Andi Vajda via Grant Ingersoll)

 7. LUCENE-510: The index now stores strings as true UTF-8 bytes
    (previously it was Java's modified UTF-8).  If any text, either
    stored fields or a token, has illegal UTF-16 surrogate characters,
    these characters are now silently replaced with the Unicode
    replacement character U+FFFD.  This is a change to the index file
    format.  (Marvin Humphrey via Mike McCandless)

 8. LUCENE-852: Let the SpellChecker caller specify IndexWriter mergeFactor
    and RAM buffer size.  (Otis Gospodnetic)
	
 9. LUCENE-1290: Deprecate org.apache.lucene.search.Hits, Hit and HitIterator
    and remove all references to these classes from the core. Also update demos
    and tutorials. (Michael Busch)

10. LUCENE-1288: Add getVersion() and getGeneration() to IndexCommit.
    getVersion() returns the same value that IndexReader.getVersion()
    returns when the reader is opened on the same commit.  (Jason
    Rutherglen via Mike McCandless)

11. LUCENE-1311: Added IndexReader.listCommits(Directory) static
    method to list all commits in a Directory, plus IndexReader.open
    methods that accept an IndexCommit and open the index as of that
    commit.  These methods are only useful if you implement a custom
    DeletionPolicy that keeps more than the last commit around.
    (Jason Rutherglen via Mike McCandless)

12. LUCENE-1325: Added IndexCommit.isOptimized().  (Shalin Shekhar
    Mangar via Mike McCandless)

13. LUCENE-1324: Added TokenFilter.reset(). (Shai Erera via Mike
    McCandless)

14. LUCENE-1340: Added Fieldable.omitTf() method to skip indexing term
    frequency, positions and payloads.  This saves index space, and
    indexing/searching time.  (Eks Dev via Mike McCandless)

15. LUCENE-1219: Add basic reuse API to Fieldable for binary fields:
    getBinaryValue/Offset/Length(); currently only lazy fields reuse
    the provided byte[] result to getBinaryValue.  (Eks Dev via Mike
    McCandless)

16. LUCENE-1334: Add new constructor for Term: Term(String fieldName)
    which defaults term text to "".  (DM Smith via Mike McCandless)

17. LUCENE-1333: Added Token.reinit(*) APIs to re-initialize (reuse) a
    Token.  Also added term() method to return a String, with a
    performance penalty clearly documented.  Also implemented
    hashCode() and equals() in Token, and fixed all core and contrib
    analyzers to use the re-use APIs.  (DM Smith via Mike McCandless)

18. LUCENE-1329: Add optional readOnly boolean when opening an
    IndexReader.  A readOnly reader is not allowed to make changes
    (deletions, norms) to the index; in exchanged, the isDeleted
    method, often a bottleneck when searching with many threads, is
    not synchronized.  The default for readOnly is still false, but in
    3.0 the default will become true.  (Jason Rutherglen via Mike
    McCandless)

Bug fixes
    
 1. LUCENE-1134: Fixed BooleanQuery.rewrite to only optimize a single 
    clause query if minNumShouldMatch<=0. (Shai Erera via Michael Busch)

 2. LUCENE-1169: Fixed bug in IndexSearcher.search(): searching with
    a filter might miss some hits because scorer.skipTo() is called
    without checking if the scorer is already at the right position.
    scorer.skipTo(scorer.doc()) is not a NOOP, it behaves as 
    scorer.next(). (Eks Dev, Michael Busch)

 3. LUCENE-1182: Added scorePayload to SimilarityDelegator (Andi Vajda via Grant Ingersoll)
 
 4. LUCENE-1213: MultiFieldQueryParser was ignoring slop in case
    of a single field phrase. (Trejkaz via Doron Cohen)

 5. LUCENE-1228: IndexWriter.commit() was not updating the index version and as
    result IndexReader.reopen() failed to sense index changes. (Doron Cohen)

 6. LUCENE-1267: Added numDocs() and maxDoc() to IndexWriter;
    deprecated docCount().  (Mike McCandless)

 7. LUCENE-1274: Added new prepareCommit() method to IndexWriter,
    which does phase 1 of a 2-phase commit (commit() does phase 2).
    This is needed when you want to update an index as part of a
    transaction involving external resources (eg a database).  Also
    deprecated abort(), renaming it to rollback().  (Mike McCandless)

 8. LUCENE-1003: Stop RussianAnalyzer from removing numbers.
    (TUSUR OpenTeam, Dmitry Lihachev via Otis Gospodnetic)

 9. LUCENE-1152: SpellChecker fix around clearIndex and indexDictionary
    methods, plus removal of IndexReader reference.
    (Naveen Belkale via Otis Gospodnetic)

10. LUCENE-1046: Removed dead code in SpellChecker
    (Daniel Naber via Otis Gospodnetic)
	
11. LUCENE-1189: Fixed the QueryParser to handle escaped characters within 
    quoted terms correctly. (Tomer Gabel via Michael Busch)

12. LUCENE-1299: Fixed NPE in SpellChecker when IndexReader is not null and field is (Grant Ingersoll)

13. LUCENE-1303: Fixed BoostingTermQuery's explanation to be marked as a Match 
    depending only upon the non-payload score part, regardless of the effect of 
    the payload on the score. Prior to this, score of a query containing a BTQ 
    differed from its explanation. (Doron Cohen)
    
14. LUCENE-1310: Fixed SloppyPhraseScorer to work also for terms repeating more 
    than twice in the query. (Doron Cohen)

15. LUCENE-1351: ISOLatin1AccentFilter now cleans additional ligatures (Cedrik Lime via Grant Ingersoll)

New features

 1. LUCENE-1137: Added Token.set/getFlags() accessors for passing more information about a Token through the analysis
    process.  The flag is not indexed/stored and is thus only used by analysis.

 2. LUCENE-1147: Add -segment option to CheckIndex tool so you can
    check only a specific segment or segments in your index.  (Mike
    McCandless)

 3. LUCENE-1045: Reopened this issue to add support for short and bytes. 
 
 4. LUCENE-584: Added new data structures to o.a.l.util, such as 
    OpenBitSet and SortedVIntList. These extend DocIdSet and can 
    directly be used for Filters with the new Filter API. Also changed
    the core Filters to use OpenBitSet instead of java.util.BitSet.
    (Paul Elschot, Michael Busch)

 5. LUCENE-494: Added QueryAutoStopWordAnalyzer to allow for the automatic removal, from a query of frequently occurring terms.
    This Analyzer is not intended for use during indexing. (Mark Harwood via Grant Ingersoll)

 6. LUCENE-1044: Change Lucene to properly "sync" files after
    committing, to ensure on a machine or OS crash or power cut, even
    with cached writes, the index remains consistent.  Also added
    explicit commit() method to IndexWriter to force a commit without
    having to close.  (Mike McCandless)
    
 7. LUCENE-997: Add search timeout (partial) support.
    A TimeLimitedCollector was added to allow limiting search time.
    It is a partial solution since timeout is checked only when 
    collecting a hit, and therefore a search for rare words in a 
    huge index might not stop within the specified time.
    (Sean Timm via Doron Cohen) 

 8. LUCENE-1184: Allow SnapshotDeletionPolicy to be re-used across
    close/re-open of IndexWriter while still protecting an open
    snapshot (Tim Brennan via Mike McCandless)

 9. LUCENE-1194: Added IndexWriter.deleteDocuments(Query) to delete
    documents matching the specified query.  Also added static unlock
    and isLocked methods (deprecating the ones in IndexReader).  (Mike
    McCandless)

10. LUCENE-1201: Add IndexReader.getIndexCommit() method. (Tim Brennan
    via Mike McCandless)

11. LUCENE-550:  Added InstantiatedIndex implementation.  Experimental 
    Index store similar to MemoryIndex but allows for multiple documents 
    in memory.  (Karl Wettin via Grant Ingersoll)

12. LUCENE-400: Added word based n-gram filter (in contrib/analyzers) called ShingleFilter and an Analyzer wrapper
    that wraps another Analyzer's token stream with a ShingleFilter (Sebastian Kirsch, Steve Rowe via Grant Ingersoll) 

13. LUCENE-1166: Decomposition tokenfilter for languages like German and Swedish (Thomas Peuss via Grant Ingersoll)

14. LUCENE-1187: ChainedFilter and BooleanFilter now work with new Filter API
    and DocIdSetIterator-based filters. Backwards-compatibility with old 
    BitSet-based filters is ensured. (Paul Elschot via Michael Busch)

15. LUCENE-1295: Added new method to MoreLikeThis for retrieving interesting terms and made retrieveTerms(int) public. (Grant Ingersoll)

16. LUCENE-1298: MoreLikeThis can now accept a custom Similarity (Grant Ingersoll)

17. LUCENE-1297: Allow other string distance measures for the SpellChecker
    (Thomas Morton via Otis Gospodnetic)

18. LUCENE-1001: Provide access to Payloads via Spans.  All existing Span Query implementations in Lucene implement. (Mark Miller, Grant Ingersoll)

Optimizations

 1. LUCENE-705: When building a compound file, use
    RandomAccessFile.setLength() to tell the OS/filesystem to
    pre-allocate space for the file.  This may improve fragmentation
    in how the CFS file is stored, and allows us to detect an upcoming
    disk full situation before actually filling up the disk.  (Mike
    McCandless)

 2. LUCENE-1120: Speed up merging of term vectors by bulk-copying the
    raw bytes for each contiguous range of non-deleted documents.
    (Mike McCandless)
	
 3. LUCENE-1185: Avoid checking if the TermBuffer 'scratch' in 
    SegmentTermEnum is null for every call of scanTo().
    (Christian Kohlschuetter via Michael Busch)

 4. LUCENE-1217: Internal to Field.java, use isBinary instead of
    runtime type checking for possible speedup of binaryValue().
    (Eks Dev via Mike McCandless)

 5. LUCENE-1183: Optimized TRStringDistance class (in contrib/spell) that uses
    less memory than the previous version.  (Cédrik LIME via Otis Gospodnetic)

 6. LUCENE-1195: Improve term lookup performance by adding a LRU cache to the
    TermInfosReader. In performance experiments the speedup was about 25% on 
    average on mid-size indexes with ~500,000 documents for queries with 3 
    terms and about 7% on larger indexes with ~4.3M documents. (Michael Busch)

Documentation

  1. LUCENE-1236:  Added some clarifying remarks to EdgeNGram*.java (Hiroaki Kawai via Grant Ingersoll)
  
  2. LUCENE-1157 and LUCENE-1256: HTML changes log, created automatically 
     from CHANGES.txt. This HTML file is curretly visible only via developers page.     
     (Steven Rowe via Doron Cohen)

  3. LUCENE-1349: Fieldable can now be changed without breaking backward compatibility rules (within reason.  See the note at
  the top of this file and also on Fieldable.java).  (Grant Ingersoll)

Build

  1. LUCENE-1153: Added JUnit JAR to new lib directory.  Updated build to rely on local JUnit instead of ANT/lib.
  
  2. LUCENE-1202: Small fixes to the way Clover is used to work better
     with contribs.  Of particular note: a single clover db is used
     regardless of whether tests are run globally or in the specific
     contrib directories. 
     
  3. LUCENE-1353: Javacc target in contrib/miscellaneous for 
     generating the precedence query parser. 

Test Cases

 1. LUCENE-1238: Fixed intermittent failures of TestTimeLimitedCollector.testTimeoutMultiThreaded.
    Within this fix, "greedy" flag was added to TimeLimitedCollector, to allow the wrapped 
    collector to collect also the last doc, after allowed-tTime passed. (Doron Cohen)   
	
 2. LUCENE-1348: relax TestTimeLimitedCollector to not fail due to 
    timeout exceeded (just because test machine is very busy).
	
======================= Release 2.3.2 2008-05-05 =======================

Bug fixes

 1. LUCENE-1191: On hitting OutOfMemoryError in any index-modifying
    methods in IndexWriter, do not commit any further changes to the
    index to prevent risk of possible corruption.  (Mike McCandless)

 2. LUCENE-1197: Fixed issue whereby IndexWriter would flush by RAM
    too early when TermVectors were in use.  (Mike McCandless)

 3. LUCENE-1198: Don't corrupt index if an exception happens inside
    DocumentsWriter.init (Mike McCandless)

 4. LUCENE-1199: Added defensive check for null indexReader before
    calling close in IndexModifier.close() (Mike McCandless)

 5. LUCENE-1200: Fix rare deadlock case in addIndexes* when
    ConcurrentMergeScheduler is in use (Mike McCandless)

 6. LUCENE-1208: Fix deadlock case on hitting an exception while
    processing a document that had triggered a flush (Mike McCandless)

 7. LUCENE-1210: Fix deadlock case on hitting an exception while
    starting a merge when using ConcurrentMergeScheduler (Mike McCandless)

 8. LUCENE-1222: Fix IndexWriter.doAfterFlush to always be called on
    flush (Mark Ferguson via Mike McCandless)
	
 9. LUCENE-1226: Fixed IndexWriter.addIndexes(IndexReader[]) to commit
    successfully created compound files. (Michael Busch)

10. LUCENE-1150: Re-expose StandardTokenizer's constants publicly;
    this was accidentally lost with LUCENE-966.  (Nicolas Lalevée via
    Mike McCandless)

11. LUCENE-1262: Fixed bug in BufferedIndexReader.refill whereby on
    hitting an exception in readInternal, the buffer is incorrectly
    filled with stale bytes such that subsequent calls to readByte()
    return incorrect results.  (Trejkaz via Mike McCandless)

12. LUCENE-1270: Fixed intermittant case where IndexWriter.close()
    would hang after IndexWriter.addIndexesNoOptimize had been
    called.  (Stu Hood via Mike McCandless)
	
Build

 1. LUCENE-1230: Include *pom.xml* in source release files. (Michael Busch)

 
======================= Release 2.3.1 2008-02-22 =======================

Bug fixes
    
 1. LUCENE-1168: Fixed corruption cases when autoCommit=false and
    documents have mixed term vectors (Suresh Guvvala via Mike
    McCandless).

 2. LUCENE-1171: Fixed some cases where OOM errors could cause
    deadlock in IndexWriter (Mike McCandless).

 3. LUCENE-1173: Fixed corruption case when autoCommit=false and bulk
    merging of stored fields is used (Yonik via Mike McCandless).

 4. LUCENE-1163: Fixed bug in CharArraySet.contains(char[] buffer, int
    offset, int len) that was ignoring offset and thus giving the
    wrong answer.  (Thomas Peuss via Mike McCandless)
	
 5. LUCENE-1177: Fix rare case where IndexWriter.optimize might do too
    many merges at the end.  (Mike McCandless)
	
 6. LUCENE-1176: Fix corruption case when documents with no term
    vector fields are added before documents with term vector fields.
    (Mike McCandless)
	
 7. LUCENE-1179: Fixed assert statement that was incorrectly
    preventing Fields with empty-string field name from working.
    (Sergey Kabashnyuk via Mike McCandless)

======================= Release 2.3.0 2008-01-21 =======================

Changes in runtime behavior

 1. LUCENE-994: Defaults for IndexWriter have been changed to maximize
    out-of-the-box indexing speed.  First, IndexWriter now flushes by
    RAM usage (16 MB by default) instead of a fixed doc count (call
    IndexWriter.setMaxBufferedDocs to get backwards compatible
    behavior).  Second, ConcurrentMergeScheduler is used to run merges
    using background threads (call IndexWriter.setMergeScheduler(new
    SerialMergeScheduler()) to get backwards compatible behavior).
    Third, merges are chosen based on size in bytes of each segment
    rather than document count of each segment (call
    IndexWriter.setMergePolicy(new LogDocMergePolicy()) to get
    backwards compatible behavior).

    NOTE: users of ParallelReader must change back all of these
    defaults in order to ensure the docIDs "align" across all parallel
    indices.

    (Mike McCandless)

 2. LUCENE-1045: SortField.AUTO didn't work with long. When detecting
    the field type for sorting automatically, numbers used to be
    interpreted as int, then as float, if parsing the number as an int
    failed. Now the detection checks for int, then for long,
    then for float. (Daniel Naber)

API Changes

 1. LUCENE-843: Added IndexWriter.setRAMBufferSizeMB(...) to have
    IndexWriter flush whenever the buffered documents are using more
    than the specified amount of RAM.  Also added new APIs to Token
    that allow one to set a char[] plus offset and length to specify a
    token (to avoid creating a new String() for each Token).  (Mike
    McCandless)

 2. LUCENE-963: Add setters to Field to allow for re-using a single
    Field instance during indexing.  This is a sizable performance
    gain, especially for small documents.  (Mike McCandless)

 3. LUCENE-969: Add new APIs to Token, TokenStream and Analyzer to
    permit re-using of Token and TokenStream instances during
    indexing.  Changed Token to use a char[] as the store for the
    termText instead of String.  This gives faster tokenization
    performance (~10-15%).  (Mike McCandless)

 4. LUCENE-847: Factored MergePolicy, which determines which merges
    should take place and when, as well as MergeScheduler, which
    determines when the selected merges should actually run, out of
    IndexWriter.  The default merge policy is now
    LogByteSizeMergePolicy (see LUCENE-845) and the default merge
    scheduler is now ConcurrentMergeScheduler (see
    LUCENE-870). (Steven Parkes via Mike McCandless)

 5. LUCENE-1052: Add IndexReader.setTermInfosIndexDivisor(int) method
    that allows you to reduce memory usage of the termInfos by further
    sub-sampling (over the termIndexInterval that was used during
    indexing) which terms are loaded into memory.  (Chuck Williams,
    Doug Cutting via Mike McCandless)
    
 6. LUCENE-743: Add IndexReader.reopen() method that re-opens an
    existing IndexReader (see New features -> 8.) (Michael Busch)

 7. LUCENE-1062: Add setData(byte[] data), 
    setData(byte[] data, int offset, int length), getData(), getOffset()
    and clone() methods to o.a.l.index.Payload. Also add the field name 
    as arg to Similarity.scorePayload(). (Michael Busch)

 8. LUCENE-982: Add IndexWriter.optimize(int maxNumSegments) method to
    "partially optimize" an index down to maxNumSegments segments.
    (Mike McCandless)

 9. LUCENE-1080: Changed Token.DEFAULT_TYPE to be public.

10. LUCENE-1064: Changed TopDocs constructor to be public. 
     (Shai Erera via Michael Busch)

11. LUCENE-1079: DocValues cleanup: constructor now has no params,
    and getInnerArray() now throws UnsupportedOperationException (Doron Cohen)

12. LUCENE-1089: Added PriorityQueue.insertWithOverflow, which returns
    the Object (if any) that was bumped from the queue to allow
    re-use.  (Shai Erera via Mike McCandless)
    
13. LUCENE-1101: Token reuse 'contract' (defined LUCENE-969)
    modified so it is token producer's responsibility
    to call Token.clear(). (Doron Cohen)   

14. LUCENE-1118: Changed StandardAnalyzer to skip too-long (default >
    255 characters) tokens.  You can increase this limit by calling
    StandardAnalyzer.setMaxTokenLength(...).  (Michael McCandless)


Bug fixes

 1. LUCENE-933: QueryParser fixed to not produce empty sub 
    BooleanQueries "()" even if the Analyzer produced no 
    tokens for input. (Doron Cohen)

 2. LUCENE-955: Fixed SegmentTermPositions to work correctly with the
    first term in the dictionary. (Michael Busch)

 3. LUCENE-951: Fixed NullPointerException in MultiLevelSkipListReader
    that was thrown after a call of TermPositions.seek(). 
    (Rich Johnson via Michael Busch)
    
 4. LUCENE-938: Fixed cases where an unhandled exception in
    IndexWriter's methods could cause deletes to be lost.
    (Steven Parkes via Mike McCandless)
      
 5. LUCENE-962: Fixed case where an unhandled exception in
    IndexWriter.addDocument or IndexWriter.updateDocument could cause
    unreferenced files in the index to not be deleted
    (Steven Parkes via Mike McCandless)
  
 6. LUCENE-957: RAMDirectory fixed to properly handle directories
    larger than Integer.MAX_VALUE. (Doron Cohen)

 7. LUCENE-781: MultiReader fixed to not throw NPE if isCurrent(),
    isOptimized() or getVersion() is called. Separated MultiReader
    into two classes: MultiSegmentReader extends IndexReader, is
    package-protected and is created automatically by IndexReader.open()
    in case the index has multiple segments. The public MultiReader 
    now extends MultiSegmentReader and is intended to be used by users
    who want to add their own subreaders. (Daniel Naber, Michael Busch)

 8. LUCENE-970: FilterIndexReader now implements isOptimized(). Before
    a call of isOptimized() would throw a NPE. (Michael Busch)

 9. LUCENE-832: ParallelReader fixed to not throw NPE if isCurrent(),
    isOptimized() or getVersion() is called. (Michael Busch)
      
10. LUCENE-948: Fix FNFE exception caused by stale NFS client
    directory listing caches when writers on different machines are
    sharing an index over NFS and using a custom deletion policy (Mike
    McCandless)

11. LUCENE-978: Ensure TermInfosReader, FieldsReader, and FieldsReader
    close any streams they had opened if an exception is hit in the
    constructor.  (Ning Li via Mike McCandless)

12. LUCENE-985: If an extremely long term is in a doc (> 16383 chars),
    we now throw an IllegalArgumentException saying the term is too
    long, instead of cryptic ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException.  (Karl
    Wettin via Mike McCandless)

13. LUCENE-991: The explain() method of BoostingTermQuery had errors
    when no payloads were present on a document.  (Peter Keegan via
    Grant Ingersoll)

14. LUCENE-992: Fixed IndexWriter.updateDocument to be atomic again
    (this was broken by LUCENE-843).  (Ning Li via Mike McCandless)

15. LUCENE-1008: Fixed corruption case when document with no term
    vector fields is added after documents with term vector fields.
    This bug was introduced with LUCENE-843.  (Grant Ingersoll via
    Mike McCandless)

16. LUCENE-1006: Fixed QueryParser to accept a "" field value (zero
    length quoted string.)  (yonik)

17. LUCENE-1010: Fixed corruption case when document with no term
    vector fields is added after documents with term vector fields.
    This case is hit during merge and would cause an EOFException.
    This bug was introduced with LUCENE-984.  (Andi Vajda via Mike
    McCandless)

19. LUCENE-1009: Fix merge slowdown with LogByteSizeMergePolicy when
    autoCommit=false and documents are using stored fields and/or term
    vectors.  (Mark Miller via Mike McCandless)

20. LUCENE-1011: Fixed corruption case when two or more machines,
    sharing an index over NFS, can be writers in quick succession.
    (Patrick Kimber via Mike McCandless)

21. LUCENE-1028: Fixed Weight serialization for few queries:
    DisjunctionMaxQuery, ValueSourceQuery, CustomScoreQuery.
    Serialization check added for all queries.
    (Kyle Maxwell via Doron Cohen)

22. LUCENE-1048: Fixed incorrect behavior in Lock.obtain(...) when the
    timeout argument is very large (eg Long.MAX_VALUE).  Also added
    Lock.LOCK_OBTAIN_WAIT_FOREVER constant to never timeout.  (Nikolay
    Diakov via Mike McCandless)

23. LUCENE-1050: Throw LockReleaseFailedException in
    Simple/NativeFSLockFactory if we fail to delete the lock file when
    releasing the lock.  (Nikolay Diakov via Mike McCandless)

24. LUCENE-1071: Fixed SegmentMerger to correctly set payload bit in 
    the merged segment. (Michael Busch)

25. LUCENE-1042: Remove throwing of IOException in getTermFreqVector(int, String, TermVectorMapper) to be consistent
    with other getTermFreqVector calls.  Also removed the throwing of the other IOException in that method to be consistent.  (Karl Wettin via Grant Ingersoll)
    
26. LUCENE-1096: Fixed Hits behavior when hits' docs are deleted 
    along with iterating the hits. Deleting docs already retrieved 
    now works seamlessly. If docs not yet retrieved are deleted 
    (e.g. from another thread), and then, relying on the initial 
    Hits.length(), an application attempts to retrieve more hits 
    than actually exist , a ConcurrentMidificationException 
    is thrown.  (Doron Cohen)

27. LUCENE-1068: Changed StandardTokenizer to fix an issue with it marking
  the type of some tokens incorrectly.  This is done by adding a new flag named
  replaceInvalidAcronym which defaults to false, the current, incorrect behavior.  Setting
  this flag to true fixes the problem.  This flag is a temporary fix and is already
  marked as being deprecated.  3.x will implement the correct approach.  (Shai Erera via Grant Ingersoll)
  LUCENE-1140: Fixed NPE caused by 1068 (Alexei Dets via Grant Ingersoll)
    
28. LUCENE-749: ChainedFilter behavior fixed when logic of 
    first filter is ANDNOT.  (Antonio Bruno via Doron Cohen)

29. LUCENE-508: Make sure SegmentTermEnum.prev() is accurate (= last
    term) after next() returns false.  (Steven Tamm via Mike
    McCandless)

    
New features

 1. LUCENE-906: Elision filter for French.
    (Mathieu Lecarme via Otis Gospodnetic)

 2. LUCENE-960: Added a SpanQueryFilter and related classes to allow for
    not only filtering, but knowing where in a Document a Filter matches
    (Grant Ingersoll)

 3. LUCENE-868: Added new Term Vector access features.  New callback
    mechanism allows application to define how and where to read Term
    Vectors from disk. This implementation contains several extensions
    of the new abstract TermVectorMapper class.  The new API should be
    back-compatible.  No changes in the actual storage of Term Vectors
    has taken place.
 3.1 LUCENE-1038: Added setDocumentNumber() method to TermVectorMapper
     to provide information about what document is being accessed.
     (Karl Wettin via Grant Ingersoll)

 4. LUCENE-975: Added PositionBasedTermVectorMapper that allows for
    position based lookup of term vector information.
    See item #3 above (LUCENE-868).

 5. LUCENE-1011: Added simple tools (all in org.apache.lucene.store)
    to verify that locking is working properly.  LockVerifyServer runs
    a separate server to verify locks.  LockStressTest runs a simple
    tool that rapidly obtains and releases locks.
    VerifyingLockFactory is a LockFactory that wraps any other
    LockFactory and consults the LockVerifyServer whenever a lock is
    obtained or released, throwing an exception if an illegal lock
    obtain occurred.  (Patrick Kimber via Mike McCandless)

 6. LUCENE-1015: Added FieldCache extension (ExtendedFieldCache) to
    support doubles and longs.  Added support into SortField for sorting
    on doubles and longs as well.  (Grant Ingersoll)

 7. LUCENE-1020: Created basic index checking & repair tool
    (o.a.l.index.CheckIndex).  When run without -fix it does a
    detailed test of all segments in the index and reports summary
    information and any errors it hit.  With -fix it will remove
    segments that had errors.  (Mike McCandless)

 8. LUCENE-743: Add IndexReader.reopen() method that re-opens an
    existing IndexReader by only loading those portions of an index
    that have changed since the reader was (re)opened. reopen() can
    be significantly faster than open(), depending on the amount of
    index changes. SegmentReader, MultiSegmentReader, MultiReader,
    and ParallelReader implement reopen(). (Michael Busch) 

 9. LUCENE-1040: CharArraySet useful for efficiently checking
    set membership of text specified by char[]. (yonik)

10. LUCENE-1073: Created SnapshotDeletionPolicy to facilitate taking a
    live backup of an index without pausing indexing.  (Mike
    McCandless)
    
11. LUCENE-1019: CustomScoreQuery enhanced to support multiple 
    ValueSource queries. (Kyle Maxwell via Doron Cohen)
    
12. LUCENE-1095: Added an option to StopFilter to increase 
    positionIncrement of the token succeeding a stopped token.
    Disabled by default. Similar option added to QueryParser 
    to consider token positions when creating PhraseQuery 
    and MultiPhraseQuery. Disabled by default (so by default
    the query parser ignores position increments).
    (Doron Cohen)



Optimizations

 1. LUCENE-937: CachingTokenFilter now uses an iterator to access the 
    Tokens that are cached in the LinkedList. This increases performance 
    significantly, especially when the number of Tokens is large. 
    (Mark Miller via Michael Busch)

 2. LUCENE-843: Substantial optimizations to improve how IndexWriter
    uses RAM for buffering documents and to speed up indexing (2X-8X
    faster).  A single shared hash table now records the in-memory
    postings per unique term and is directly flushed into a single
    segment.  (Mike McCandless)
 
 3. LUCENE-892: Fixed extra "buffer to buffer copy" that sometimes
    takes place when using compound files.  (Mike McCandless)

 4. LUCENE-959: Remove synchronization in Document (yonik)

 5. LUCENE-963: Add setters to Field to allow for re-using a single
    Field instance during indexing.  This is a sizable performance
    gain, especially for small documents.  (Mike McCandless)

 6. LUCENE-939: Check explicitly for boundary conditions in FieldInfos
    and don't rely on exceptions. (Michael Busch)

 7. LUCENE-966: Very substantial speedups (~6X faster) for
    StandardTokenizer (StandardAnalyzer) by using JFlex instead of
    JavaCC to generate the tokenizer.
    (Stanislaw Osinski via Mike McCandless)

 8. LUCENE-969: Changed core tokenizers & filters to re-use Token and
    TokenStream instances when possible to improve tokenization
    performance (~10-15%). (Mike McCandless)

 9. LUCENE-871: Speedup ISOLatin1AccentFilter (Ian Boston via Mike
    McCandless)

10. LUCENE-986: Refactored SegmentInfos from IndexReader into the new
    subclass DirectoryIndexReader. SegmentReader and MultiSegmentReader
    now extend DirectoryIndexReader and are the only IndexReader 
    implementations that use SegmentInfos to access an index and 
    acquire a write lock for index modifications. (Michael Busch)

11. LUCENE-1007: Allow flushing in IndexWriter to be triggered by
    either RAM usage or document count or both (whichever comes
    first), by adding symbolic constant DISABLE_AUTO_FLUSH to disable
    one of the flush triggers.  (Ning Li via Mike McCandless)

12. LUCENE-1043: Speed up merging of stored fields by bulk-copying the
    raw bytes for each contiguous range of non-deleted documents.
    (Robert Engels via Mike McCandless)

13. LUCENE-693: Speed up nested conjunctions (~2x) that match many
    documents, and a slight performance increase for top level
    conjunctions.  (yonik)

14. LUCENE-1098: Make inner class StandardAnalyzer.SavedStreams static 
    and final. (Nathan Beyer via Michael Busch)

Documentation

 1. LUCENE-1051: Generate separate javadocs for core, demo and contrib
    classes, as well as an unified view. Also add an appropriate menu 
    structure to the website. (Michael Busch)

 2. LUCENE-746: Fix error message in AnalyzingQueryParser.getPrefixQuery.
    (Ronnie Kolehmainen via Michael Busch)

Build

 1. LUCENE-908: Improvements and simplifications for how the MANIFEST
    file and the META-INF dir are created. (Michael Busch)

 2. LUCENE-935: Various improvements for the maven artifacts. Now the
    artifacts also include the sources as .jar files. (Michael Busch)

 3. Added apply-patch target to top-level build.  Defaults to looking for
    a patch in ${basedir}/../patches with name specified by -Dpatch.name.
    Can also specify any location by -Dpatch.file property on the command
    line.  This should be helpful for easy application of patches, but it
    is also a step towards integrating automatic patch application with
    JIRA and Hudson, and is thus subject to change.  (Grant Ingersoll)
 
 4. LUCENE-935: Defined property "m2.repository.url" to allow setting
    the url to a maven remote repository to deploy to. (Michael Busch)

 5. LUCENE-1051: Include javadocs in the maven artifacts. (Michael Busch)

 6. LUCENE-1055: Remove gdata-server from build files and its sources 
    from trunk. (Michael Busch)

 7. LUCENE-935: Allow to deploy maven artifacts to a remote m2 repository
    via scp and ssh authentication. (Michael Busch)
	
 8. LUCENE-1123: Allow overriding the specification version for 
    MANIFEST.MF (Michael Busch)

Test Cases

 1. LUCENE-766: Test adding two fields with the same name but different 
    term vector setting.  (Nicolas Lalevée via Doron Cohen)  
    
======================= Release 2.2.0 2007-06-19 =======================

Changes in runtime behavior

API Changes

 1. LUCENE-793: created new exceptions and added them to throws clause
    for many methods (all subclasses of IOException for backwards
    compatibility): index.StaleReaderException,
    index.CorruptIndexException, store.LockObtainFailedException.
    This was done to better call out the possible root causes of an
    IOException from these methods.  (Mike McCandless)

 2. LUCENE-811: make SegmentInfos class, plus a few methods from related
    classes, package-private again (they were unnecessarily made public
    as part of LUCENE-701).  (Mike McCandless)

 3. LUCENE-710: added optional autoCommit boolean to IndexWriter
    constructors.  When this is false, index changes are not committed
    until the writer is closed.  This gives explicit control over when
    a reader will see the changes.  Also added optional custom
    deletion policy to explicitly control when prior commits are
    removed from the index.  This is intended to allow applications to
    share an index over NFS by customizing when prior commits are
    deleted. (Mike McCandless)

 4. LUCENE-818: changed most public methods of IndexWriter,
    IndexReader (and its subclasses), FieldsReader and RAMDirectory to
    throw AlreadyClosedException if they are accessed after being
    closed.  (Mike McCandless)

 5. LUCENE-834: Changed some access levels for certain Span classes to allow them
    to be overridden.  They have been marked expert only and not for public
    consumption. (Grant Ingersoll) 

 6. LUCENE-796: Removed calls to super.* from various get*Query methods in
    MultiFieldQueryParser, in order to allow sub-classes to override them.
    (Steven Parkes via Otis Gospodnetic)

 7. LUCENE-857: Removed caching from QueryFilter and deprecated QueryFilter
    in favour of QueryWrapperFilter or QueryWrapperFilter + CachingWrapperFilter
    combination when caching is desired.
    (Chris Hostetter, Otis Gospodnetic)

 8. LUCENE-869: Changed FSIndexInput and FSIndexOutput to inner classes of FSDirectory
    to enable extensibility of these classes. (Michael Busch)

 9. LUCENE-580: Added the public method reset() to TokenStream. This method does
    nothing by default, but may be overwritten by subclasses to support consuming
    the TokenStream more than once. (Michael Busch)

10. LUCENE-580: Added a new constructor to Field that takes a TokenStream as
    argument, available as tokenStreamValue(). This is useful to avoid the need of 
    "dummy analyzers" for pre-analyzed fields. (Karl Wettin, Michael Busch)

11. LUCENE-730: Added the new methods to BooleanQuery setAllowDocsOutOfOrder() and
    getAllowDocsOutOfOrder(). Deprecated the methods setUseScorer14() and 
    getUseScorer14(). The optimization patch LUCENE-730 (see Optimizations->3.) 
    improves performance for certain queries but results in scoring out of docid 
    order. This patch reverse this change, so now by default hit docs are scored
    in docid order if not setAllowDocsOutOfOrder(true) is explicitly called.
    This patch also enables the tests in QueryUtils again that check for docid
    order. (Paul Elschot, Doron Cohen, Michael Busch)

12. LUCENE-888: Added Directory.openInput(File path, int bufferSize)
    to optionally specify the size of the read buffer.  Also added
    BufferedIndexInput.setBufferSize(int) to change the buffer size.
    (Mike McCandless)

13. LUCENE-923: Make SegmentTermPositionVector package-private. It does not need
    to be public because it implements the public interface TermPositionVector.
    (Michael Busch)

Bug fixes

 1. LUCENE-804: Fixed build.xml to pack a fully compilable src dist.  (Doron Cohen)

 2. LUCENE-813: Leading wildcard fixed to work with trailing wildcard.
    Query parser modified to create a prefix query only for the case 
    that there is a single trailing wildcard (and no additional wildcard 
    or '?' in the query text).  (Doron Cohen)

 3. LUCENE-812: Add no-argument constructors to NativeFSLockFactory
    and SimpleFSLockFactory.  This enables all 4 builtin LockFactory
    implementations to be specified via the System property
    org.apache.lucene.store.FSDirectoryLockFactoryClass.  (Mike McCandless)

 4. LUCENE-821: The new single-norm-file introduced by LUCENE-756
    failed to reduce the number of open descriptors since it was still
    opened once per field with norms. (yonik)

 5. LUCENE-823: Make sure internal file handles are closed when
    hitting an exception (eg disk full) while flushing deletes in
    IndexWriter's mergeSegments, and also during
    IndexWriter.addIndexes.  (Mike McCandless)

 6. LUCENE-825: If directory is removed after
    FSDirectory.getDirectory() but before IndexReader.open you now get
    a FileNotFoundException like Lucene pre-2.1 (before this fix you
    got an NPE).  (Mike McCandless)

 7. LUCENE-800: Removed backslash from the TERM_CHAR list in the queryparser, 
    because the backslash is the escape character. Also changed the ESCAPED_CHAR
    list to contain all possible characters, because every character that 
    follows a backslash should be considered as escaped. (Michael Busch)

 8. LUCENE-372: QueryParser.parse() now ensures that the entire input string 
    is consumed. Now a ParseException is thrown if a query contains too many
    closing parentheses. (Andreas Neumann via Michael Busch)

 9. LUCENE-814: javacc build targets now fix line-end-style of generated files.
    Now also deleting all javacc generated files before calling javacc.
    (Steven Parkes, Doron Cohen)
    
10. LUCENE-829: close readers in contrib/benchmark. (Karl Wettin, Doron Cohen)

11. LUCENE-828: Minor fix for Term's equal().
    (Paul Cowan via Otis Gospodnetic)

12. LUCENE-846: Fixed: if IndexWriter is opened with autoCommit=false,
    and you call addIndexes, and hit an exception (eg disk full) then
    when IndexWriter rolls back its internal state this could corrupt
    the instance of IndexWriter (but, not the index itself) by
    referencing already deleted segments.  This bug was only present
    in 2.2 (trunk), ie was never released.  (Mike McCandless)
    
13. LUCENE-736: Sloppy phrase query with repeating terms matches wrong docs.
    For example query "B C B"~2 matches the doc "A B C D E". (Doron Cohen)
    
14. LUCENE-789: Fixed: custom similarity is ignored when using MultiSearcher (problem reported 
    by Alexey Lef). Now the similarity applied by MultiSearcer.setSimilarity(sim) is being used. 
    Note that as before this fix, creating a multiSearcher from Searchers for whom custom similarity 
    was set has no effect - it is masked by the similarity of the MultiSearcher. This is as 
    designed, because MultiSearcher operates on Searchables (not Searchers). (Doron Cohen)

15. LUCENE-880: Fixed DocumentWriter to close the TokenStreams after it
    has written the postings. Then the resources associated with the 
    TokenStreams can safely be released. (Michael Busch)

16. LUCENE-883: consecutive calls to Spellchecker.indexDictionary()
    won't insert terms twice anymore. (Daniel Naber)

17. LUCENE-881: QueryParser.escape() now also escapes the characters
    '|' and '&' which are part of the queryparser syntax. (Michael Busch)

18. LUCENE-886: Spellchecker clean up: exceptions aren't printed to STDERR
    anymore and ignored, but re-thrown. Some javadoc improvements.
    (Daniel Naber)

19. LUCENE-698: FilteredQuery now takes the query boost into account for 
    scoring. (Michael Busch)

20. LUCENE-763: Spellchecker: LuceneDictionary used to skip first word in 
    enumeration. (Christian Mallwitz via Daniel Naber)
    
21. LUCENE-903: FilteredQuery explanation inaccuracy with boost.
    Explanation tests now "deep" check the explanation details.
    (Chris Hostetter, Doron Cohen)
    
22. LUCENE-912: DisjunctionMaxScorer first skipTo(target) call ignores the 
    skip target param and ends up at the first match.
    (Sudaakeran B. via Chris Hostetter & Doron Cohen)
    
23. LUCENE-913: Two consecutive score() calls return different 
    scores for Boolean Queries. (Michael Busch, Doron Cohen)

24. LUCENE-1013: Fix IndexWriter.setMaxMergeDocs to work "out of the
    box", again, by moving set/getMaxMergeDocs up from
    LogDocMergePolicy into LogMergePolicy.  This fixes the API
    breakage (non backwards compatible change) caused by LUCENE-994.
    (Yonik Seeley via Mike McCandless)

New features

 1. LUCENE-759: Added two n-gram-producing TokenFilters.
    (Otis Gospodnetic)

 2. LUCENE-822: Added FieldSelector capabilities to Searchable for use with
    RemoteSearcher, and other Searchable implementations. (Mark Miller, Grant Ingersoll)

 3. LUCENE-755: Added the ability to store arbitrary binary metadata in the posting list.
    These metadata are called Payloads. For every position of a Token one Payload in the form
    of a variable length byte array can be stored in the prox file.
    Remark: The APIs introduced with this feature are in experimental state and thus
            contain appropriate warnings in the javadocs.
    (Michael Busch)

 4. LUCENE-834: Added BoostingTermQuery which can boost scores based on the
    values of a payload (see #3 above.) (Grant Ingersoll)

 5. LUCENE-834: Similarity has a new method for scoring payloads called
    scorePayloads that can be overridden to take advantage of payload
    storage (see #3 above)

 6. LUCENE-834: Added isPayloadAvailable() onto TermPositions interface and
    implemented it in the appropriate places (Grant Ingersoll)

 7. LUCENE-853: Added RemoteCachingWrapperFilter to enable caching of Filters
    on the remote side of the RMI connection.
    (Matt Ericson via Otis Gospodnetic)

 8. LUCENE-446: Added Solr's search.function for scores based on field 
    values, plus CustomScoreQuery for simple score (post) customization.
    (Yonik Seeley, Doron Cohen)

 9. LUCENE-1058: Added new TeeTokenFilter (like the UNIX 'tee' command) and SinkTokenizer which can be used to share tokens between two or more
    Fields such that the other Fields do not have to go through the whole Analysis process over again.  For instance, if you have two
    Fields that share all the same analysis steps except one lowercases tokens and the other does not, you can coordinate the operations
    between the two using the TeeTokenFilter and the SinkTokenizer.  See TeeSinkTokenTest.java for examples.
    (Grant Ingersoll, Michael Busch, Yonik Seeley)
 
Optimizations

 1. LUCENE-761: The proxStream is now cloned lazily in SegmentTermPositions
    when nextPosition() is called for the first time. This allows using instances
    of SegmentTermPositions instead of SegmentTermDocs without additional costs.
    (Michael Busch)

 2. LUCENE-431: RAMInputStream and RAMOutputStream extend IndexInput and
    IndexOutput directly now. This avoids further buffering and thus avoids 
    unnecessary array copies. (Michael Busch)

 3. LUCENE-730: Updated BooleanScorer2 to make use of BooleanScorer in some
    cases and possibly improve scoring performance.  Documents can now be
    delivered out-of-order as they are scored (e.g. to HitCollector).
    N.B. A bit of code had to be disabled in QueryUtils in order for
    TestBoolean2 test to keep passing.
    (Paul Elschot via Otis Gospodnetic)

 4. LUCENE-882: Spellchecker doesn't store the ngrams anymore but only indexes
    them to keep the spell index small. (Daniel Naber)

 5. LUCENE-430: Delay allocation of the buffer after a clone of BufferedIndexInput.
    Together with LUCENE-888 this will allow to adjust the buffer size
    dynamically. (Paul Elschot, Michael Busch)
 
 6. LUCENE-888: Increase buffer sizes inside CompoundFileWriter and
    BufferedIndexOutput.  Also increase buffer size in
    BufferedIndexInput, but only when used during merging.  Together,
    these increases yield 10-18% overall performance gain vs the
    previous 1K defaults.  (Mike McCandless)

 7. LUCENE-866: Adds multi-level skip lists to the posting lists. This speeds 
    up most queries that use skipTo(), especially on big indexes with large posting 
    lists. For average AND queries the speedup is about 20%, for queries that 
    contain very frequent and very unique terms the speedup can be over 80%.
    (Michael Busch)

Documentation

 1. LUCENE 791 && INFRA-1173: Infrastructure moved the Wiki to
    http://wiki.apache.org/lucene-java/   Updated the links in the docs and
    wherever else I found references.  (Grant Ingersoll, Joe Schaefer)

 2. LUCENE-807: Fixed the javadoc for ScoreDocComparator.compare() to be 
    consistent with java.util.Comparator.compare(): Any integer is allowed to 
    be returned instead of only -1/0/1.
    (Paul Cowan via Michael Busch)
 
 3. LUCENE-875: Solved javadoc warnings & errors under jdk1.4. 
    Solved javadoc errors under jdk5 (jars in path for gdata).
    Made "javadocs" target depend on "build-contrib" for first downloading
    contrib jars configured for dynamic downloaded. (Note: when running
    behind firewall, a firewall prompt might pop up) (Doron Cohen)

 4. LUCENE-740: Added SNOWBALL-LICENSE.txt to the snowball package and a
    remark about the license to NOTICE.TXT. (Steven Parkes via Michael Busch)

 5. LUCENE-925: Added analysis package javadocs. (Grant Ingersoll and Doron Cohen)

 6. LUCENE-926: Added document package javadocs. (Grant Ingersoll)

Build

 1. LUCENE-802: Added LICENSE.TXT and NOTICE.TXT to Lucene jars.
    (Steven Parkes via Michael Busch)

 2. LUCENE-885: "ant test" now includes all contrib tests.  The new
    "ant test-core" target can be used to run only the Core (non
    contrib) tests. 
    (Chris Hostetter)
    
 3. LUCENE-900: "ant test" now enables Java assertions (in Lucene packages).
    (Doron Cohen)

 4. LUCENE-894: Add custom build file for binary distributions that includes
    targets to build the demos. (Chris Hostetter, Michael Busch)

 5. LUCENE-904: The "package" targets in build.xml now also generate .md5
    checksum files. (Chris Hostetter, Michael Busch)

 6. LUCENE-907: Include LICENSE.TXT and NOTICE.TXT in the META-INF dirs of
    demo war, demo jar, and the contrib jars. (Michael Busch)
    
 7. LUCENE-909: Demo targets for running the demo. (Doron Cohen)

 8. LUCENE-908: Improves content of MANIFEST file and makes it customizable
    for the contribs. Adds SNOWBALL-LICENSE.txt to META-INF of the snowball
    jar and makes sure that the lucli jar contains LICENSE.txt and NOTICE.txt.
    (Chris Hostetter, Michael Busch)

 9. LUCENE-930: Various contrib building improvements to ensure contrib
    dependencies are met, and test compilation errors fail the build.
    (Steven Parkes, Chris Hostetter)

10. LUCENE-622: Add ant target and pom.xml files for building maven artifacts 
    of the Lucene core and the contrib modules. 
    (Sami Siren, Karl Wettin, Michael Busch)

======================= Release 2.1.0 2007-02-14 =======================

Changes in runtime behavior

 1. 's' and 't' have been removed from the list of default stopwords
    in StopAnalyzer (also used in by StandardAnalyzer). Having e.g. 's'
    as a stopword meant that 's-class' led to the same results as 'class'.
    Note that this problem still exists for 'a', e.g. in 'a-class' as
    'a' continues to be a stopword.
    (Daniel Naber)

 2. LUCENE-478: Updated the list of Unicode code point ranges for CJK
    (now split into CJ and K) in StandardAnalyzer.  (John Wang and
    Steven Rowe via Otis Gospodnetic)

 3. Modified some CJK Unicode code point ranges in StandardTokenizer.jj,
    and added a few more of them to increase CJK character coverage.
    Also documented some of the ranges.
    (Otis Gospodnetic)

 4. LUCENE-489: Add support for leading wildcard characters (*, ?) to
    QueryParser.  Default is to disallow them, as before.
    (Steven Parkes via Otis Gospodnetic)

 5. LUCENE-703: QueryParser changed to default to use of ConstantScoreRangeQuery
    for range queries. Added useOldRangeQuery property to QueryParser to allow
    selection of old RangeQuery class if required.
    (Mark Harwood)

 6. LUCENE-543: WildcardQuery now performs a TermQuery if the provided term
    does not contain a wildcard character (? or *), when previously a
    StringIndexOutOfBoundsException was thrown.
    (Michael Busch via Erik Hatcher)

 7. LUCENE-726: Removed the use of deprecated doc.fields() method and
    Enumeration.
    (Michael Busch via Otis Gospodnetic)

 8. LUCENE-436: Removed finalize() in TermInfosReader and SegmentReader,
    and added a call to enumerators.remove() in TermInfosReader.close().
    The finalize() overrides were added to help with a pre-1.4.2 JVM bug
    that has since been fixed, plus we no longer support pre-1.4.2 JVMs.
    (Otis Gospodnetic)

 9. LUCENE-771: The default location of the write lock is now the
    index directory, and is named simply "write.lock" (without a big
    digest prefix).  The system properties "org.apache.lucene.lockDir"
    nor "java.io.tmpdir" are no longer used as the global directory
    for storing lock files, and the LOCK_DIR field of FSDirectory is
    now deprecated.  (Mike McCandless)

New features

 1. LUCENE-503: New ThaiAnalyzer and ThaiWordFilter in contrib/analyzers
    (Samphan Raruenrom via Chris Hostetter)

 2. LUCENE-545: New FieldSelector API and associated changes to
    IndexReader and implementations.  New Fieldable interface for use
    with the lazy field loading mechanism.  (Grant Ingersoll and Chuck
    Williams via Grant Ingersoll)

 3. LUCENE-676: Move Solr's PrefixFilter to Lucene core. (Yura
    Smolsky, Yonik Seeley)

 4. LUCENE-678: Added NativeFSLockFactory, which implements locking
    using OS native locking (via java.nio.*).  (Michael McCandless via
    Yonik Seeley)

 5. LUCENE-544: Added the ability to specify different boosts for
    different fields when using MultiFieldQueryParser (Matt Ericson
    via Otis Gospodnetic)

 6. LUCENE-528: New IndexWriter.addIndexesNoOptimize() that doesn't
    optimize the index when adding new segments, only performing
    merges as needed.  (Ning Li via Yonik Seeley)

 7. LUCENE-573: QueryParser now allows backslash escaping in
    quoted terms and phrases. (Michael Busch via Yonik Seeley)

 8. LUCENE-716: QueryParser now allows specification of Unicode
    characters in terms via a unicode escape of the form \uXXXX
    (Michael Busch via Yonik Seeley)

 9. LUCENE-709: Added RAMDirectory.sizeInBytes(), IndexWriter.ramSizeInBytes()
    and IndexWriter.flushRamSegments(), allowing applications to
    control the amount of memory used to buffer documents.
    (Chuck Williams via Yonik Seeley)

10. LUCENE-723: QueryParser now parses *:* as MatchAllDocsQuery
    (Yonik Seeley)

11. LUCENE-741: Command-line utility for modifying or removing norms
    on fields in an existing index.  This is mostly based on LUCENE-496
    and lives in contrib/miscellaneous.
    (Chris Hostetter, Otis Gospodnetic)

12. LUCENE-759: Added NGramTokenizer and EdgeNGramTokenizer classes and
    their passing unit tests.
    (Otis Gospodnetic)

13. LUCENE-565: Added methods to IndexWriter to more efficiently
    handle updating documents (the "delete then add" use case).  This
    is intended to be an eventual replacement for the existing
    IndexModifier.  Added IndexWriter.flush() (renamed from
    flushRamSegments()) to flush all pending updates (held in RAM), to
    the Directory.  (Ning Li via Mike McCandless)

14. LUCENE-762: Added in SIZE and SIZE_AND_BREAK FieldSelectorResult options
    which allow one to retrieve the size of a field without retrieving the
    actual field. (Chuck Williams via Grant Ingersoll)

15. LUCENE-799: Properly handle lazy, compressed fields.
    (Mike Klaas via Grant Ingersoll)

API Changes

 1. LUCENE-438: Remove "final" from Token, implement Cloneable, allow
    changing of termText via setTermText().  (Yonik Seeley)

 2. org.apache.lucene.analysis.nl.WordlistLoader has been deprecated
    and is supposed to be replaced with the WordlistLoader class in
    package org.apache.lucene.analysis (Daniel Naber)

 3. LUCENE-609: Revert return type of Document.getField(s) to Field
    for backward compatibility, added new Document.getFieldable(s)
    for access to new lazy loaded fields. (Yonik Seeley)

 4. LUCENE-608: Document.fields() has been deprecated and a new method
    Document.getFields() has been added that returns a List instead of
    an Enumeration (Daniel Naber)

 5. LUCENE-605: New Explanation.isMatch() method and new ComplexExplanation
    subclass allows explain methods to produce Explanations which model
    "matching" independent of having a positive value.
    (Chris Hostetter)

 6. LUCENE-621: New static methods IndexWriter.setDefaultWriteLockTimeout
    and IndexWriter.setDefaultCommitLockTimeout for overriding default
    timeout values for all future instances of IndexWriter (as well
    as for any other classes that may reference the static values,
    ie: IndexReader).
    (Michael McCandless via Chris Hostetter)

 7. LUCENE-638: FSDirectory.list() now only returns the directory's
    Lucene-related files. Thanks to this change one can now construct
    a RAMDirectory from a file system directory that contains files
    not related to Lucene.
    (Simon Willnauer via Daniel Naber)

 8. LUCENE-635: Decoupling locking implementation from Directory
    implementation.  Added set/getLockFactory to Directory and moved
    all locking code into subclasses of abstract class LockFactory.
    FSDirectory and RAMDirectory still default to their prior locking
    implementations, but now you can mix & match, for example using
    SingleInstanceLockFactory (ie, in memory locking) locking with an
    FSDirectory.  Note that now you must call setDisableLocks before
    the instantiation a FSDirectory if you wish to disable locking
    for that Directory.
    (Michael McCandless, Jeff Patterson via Yonik Seeley)

 9. LUCENE-657: Made FuzzyQuery non-final and inner ScoreTerm protected.
    (Steven Parkes via Otis Gospodnetic)

10. LUCENE-701: Lockless commits: a commit lock is no longer required
    when a writer commits and a reader opens the index.  This includes
    a change to the index file format (see docs/fileformats.html for
    details).  It also removes all APIs associated with the commit
    lock & its timeout.  Readers are now truly read-only and do not
    block one another on startup.  This is the first step to getting
    Lucene to work correctly over NFS (second step is
    LUCENE-710). (Mike McCandless)

11. LUCENE-722: DEFAULT_MIN_DOC_FREQ was misspelled DEFALT_MIN_DOC_FREQ
    in Similarity's MoreLikeThis class. The misspelling has been
    replaced by the correct spelling.
    (Andi Vajda via Daniel Naber)

12. LUCENE-738: Reduce the size of the file that keeps track of which
    documents are deleted when the number of deleted documents is
    small.  This changes the index file format and cannot be
    read by previous versions of Lucene.  (Doron Cohen via Yonik Seeley)

13. LUCENE-756: Maintain all norms in a single .nrm file to reduce the
    number of open files and file descriptors for the non-compound index
    format.  This changes the index file format, but maintains the
    ability to read and update older indices. The first segment merge
    on an older format index will create a single .nrm file for the new
    segment.  (Doron Cohen via Yonik Seeley)

14. LUCENE-732: DateTools support has been added to QueryParser, with
    setters for both the default Resolution, and per-field Resolution.
    For backwards compatibility, DateField is still used if no Resolutions
    are specified. (Michael Busch via Chris Hostetter)

15. Added isOptimized() method to IndexReader.
    (Otis Gospodnetic)

16. LUCENE-773: Deprecate the FSDirectory.getDirectory(*) methods that
    take a boolean "create" argument.  Instead you should use
    IndexWriter's "create" argument to create a new index.
    (Mike McCandless)

17. LUCENE-780: Add a static Directory.copy() method to copy files
    from one Directory to another.  (Jiri Kuhn via Mike McCandless)

18. LUCENE-773: Added Directory.clearLock(String name) to forcefully
    remove an old lock.  The default implementation is to ask the
    lockFactory (if non null) to clear the lock.  (Mike McCandless)

19. LUCENE-795: Directory.renameFile() has been deprecated as it is
    not used anymore inside Lucene.  (Daniel Naber)

Bug fixes

 1. Fixed the web application demo (built with "ant war-demo") which
    didn't work because it used a QueryParser method that had
    been removed (Daniel Naber)

 2. LUCENE-583: ISOLatin1AccentFilter fails to preserve positionIncrement
    (Yonik Seeley)

 3. LUCENE-575: SpellChecker min score is incorrectly changed by suggestSimilar
    (Karl Wettin via Yonik Seeley)

 4. LUCENE-587: Explanation.toHtml was producing malformed HTML
    (Chris Hostetter)

 5. Fix to allow MatchAllDocsQuery to be used with RemoteSearcher (Yonik Seeley)

 6. LUCENE-601: RAMDirectory and RAMFile made Serializable
    (Karl Wettin via Otis Gospodnetic)

 7. LUCENE-557: Fixes to BooleanQuery and FilteredQuery so that the score
    Explanations match up with the real scores.
    (Chris Hostetter)

 8. LUCENE-607: ParallelReader's TermEnum fails to advance properly to
    new fields (Chuck Williams, Christian Kohlschuetter via Yonik Seeley)

 9. LUCENE-610,LUCENE-611: Simple syntax changes to allow compilation with ecj:
    disambiguate inner class scorer's use of doc() in BooleanScorer2,
    other test code changes.  (DM Smith via Yonik Seeley)

10. LUCENE-451: All core query types now use ComplexExplanations so that
    boosts of zero don't confuse the BooleanWeight explain method.
    (Chris Hostetter)

11. LUCENE-593: Fixed LuceneDictionary's inner Iterator
    (Kåre Fiedler Christiansen via Otis Gospodnetic)

12. LUCENE-641: fixed an off-by-one bug with IndexWriter.setMaxFieldLength()
    (Daniel Naber)

13. LUCENE-659: Make PerFieldAnalyzerWrapper delegate getPositionIncrementGap()
    to the correct analyzer for the field. (Chuck Williams via Yonik Seeley)

14. LUCENE-650: Fixed NPE in Locale specific String Sort when Document
    has no value.
    (Oliver Hutchison via Chris Hostetter)

15. LUCENE-683: Fixed data corruption when reading lazy loaded fields.
    (Yonik Seeley)

16. LUCENE-678: Fixed bug in NativeFSLockFactory which caused the same
    lock to be shared between different directories.
    (Michael McCandless via Yonik Seeley)

17. LUCENE-690: Fixed thread unsafe use of IndexInput by lazy loaded fields.
    (Yonik Seeley)

18. LUCENE-696: Fix bug when scorer for DisjunctionMaxQuery has skipTo()
    called on it before next().  (Yonik Seeley)

19. LUCENE-569: Fixed SpanNearQuery bug, for 'inOrder' queries it would fail
    to recognize ordered spans if they overlapped with unordered spans.
    (Paul Elschot via Chris Hostetter)

20. LUCENE-706: Updated fileformats.xml|html concerning the docdelta value
    in the frequency file. (Johan Stuyts, Doron Cohen via Grant Ingersoll)

21. LUCENE-715: Fixed private constructor in IndexWriter.java to
    properly release the acquired write lock if there is an
    IOException after acquiring the write lock but before finishing
    instantiation. (Matthew Bogosian via Mike McCandless)

22. LUCENE-651: Multiple different threads requesting the same
    FieldCache entry (often for Sorting by a field) at the same
    time caused multiple generations of that entry, which was
    detrimental to performance and memory use.
    (Oliver Hutchison via Otis Gospodnetic)

23. LUCENE-717: Fixed build.xml not to fail when there is no lib dir.
    (Doron Cohen via Otis Gospodnetic)

24. LUCENE-728: Removed duplicate/old MoreLikeThis and SimilarityQueries
    classes from contrib/similarity, as their new home is under
    contrib/queries.
    (Otis Gospodnetic)

25. LUCENE-669: Do not double-close the RandomAccessFile in
    FSIndexInput/Output during finalize().  Besides sending an
    IOException up to the GC, this may also be the cause intermittent
    "The handle is invalid" IOExceptions on Windows when trying to
    close readers or writers. (Michael Busch via Mike McCandless)

26. LUCENE-702: Fix IndexWriter.addIndexes(*) to not corrupt the index
    on any exceptions (eg disk full).  The semantics of these methods
    is now transactional: either all indices are merged or none are.
    Also fixed IndexWriter.mergeSegments (called outside of
    addIndexes(*) by addDocument, optimize, flushRamSegments) and
    IndexReader.commit() (called by close) to clean up and keep the
    instance state consistent to what's actually in the index (Mike
    McCandless).

27. LUCENE-129: Change finalizers to do "try {...} finally
    {super.finalize();}" to make sure we don't miss finalizers in
    classes above us. (Esmond Pitt via Mike McCandless)

28. LUCENE-754: Fix a problem introduced by LUCENE-651, causing
    IndexReaders to hang around forever, in addition to not
    fixing the original FieldCache performance problem.
    (Chris Hostetter, Yonik Seeley)

29. LUCENE-140: Fix IndexReader.deleteDocument(int docNum) to
    correctly raise ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException when docNum is too
    large.  Previously, if docNum was only slightly too large (within
    the same multiple of 8, ie, up to 7 ints beyond maxDoc), no
    exception would be raised and instead the index would become
    silently corrupted.  The corruption then only appears much later,
    in mergeSegments, when the corrupted segment is merged with
    segment(s) after it. (Mike McCandless)

30. LUCENE-768: Fix case where an Exception during deleteDocument,
    undeleteAll or setNorm in IndexReader could leave the reader in a
    state where close() fails to release the write lock.
    (Mike McCandless)

31. Remove "tvp" from known index file extensions because it is
    never used. (Nicolas Lalevée via Bernhard Messer)
    
32. LUCENE-767: Change how SegmentReader.maxDoc() is computed to not
    rely on file length check and instead use the SegmentInfo's
    docCount that's already stored explicitly in the index.  This is a
    defensive bug fix (ie, there is no known problem seen "in real
    life" due to this, just a possible future problem).  (Chuck
    Williams via Mike McCandless)

Optimizations

  1. LUCENE-586: TermDocs.skipTo() is now more efficient for
     multi-segment indexes.  This will improve the performance of many
     types of queries against a non-optimized index. (Andrew Hudson
     via Yonik Seeley)

  2. LUCENE-623: RAMDirectory.close now nulls out its reference to all
     internal "files", allowing them to be GCed even if references to the
     RAMDirectory itself still exist. (Nadav Har'El via Chris Hostetter)

  3. LUCENE-629: Compressed fields are no longer uncompressed and
     recompressed during segment merges (e.g. during indexing or
     optimizing), thus improving performance . (Michael Busch via Otis
     Gospodnetic)

  4. LUCENE-388: Improve indexing performance when maxBufferedDocs is
     large by keeping a count of buffered documents rather than
     counting after each document addition.  (Doron Cohen, Paul Smith,
     Yonik Seeley)

  5. Modified TermScorer.explain to use TermDocs.skipTo() instead of
     looping through docs. (Grant Ingersoll)

  6. LUCENE-672: New indexing segment merge policy flushes all
     buffered docs to their own segment and delays a merge until
     mergeFactor segments of a certain level have been accumulated.
     This increases indexing performance in the presence of deleted
     docs or partially full segments as well as enabling future
     optimizations.

     NOTE: this also fixes an "under-merging" bug whereby it is
     possible to get far too many segments in your index (which will
     drastically slow down search, risks exhausting file descriptor
     limit, etc.).  This can happen when the number of buffered docs
     at close, plus the number of docs in the last non-ram segment is
     greater than mergeFactor. (Ning Li, Yonik Seeley)

  7. Lazy loaded fields unnecessarily retained an extra copy of loaded
     String data.  (Yonik Seeley)

  8. LUCENE-443: ConjunctionScorer performance increase.  Speed up
     any BooleanQuery with more than one mandatory clause.
     (Abdul Chaudhry, Paul Elschot via Yonik Seeley)

  9. LUCENE-365: DisjunctionSumScorer performance increase of
     ~30%. Speeds up queries with optional clauses. (Paul Elschot via
     Yonik Seeley)

 10. LUCENE-695: Optimized BufferedIndexInput.readBytes() for medium
     size buffers, which will speed up merging and retrieving binary
     and compressed fields.  (Nadav Har'El via Yonik Seeley)

 11. LUCENE-687: Lazy skipping on proximity file speeds up most
     queries involving term positions, including phrase queries.
     (Michael Busch via Yonik Seeley)

 12. LUCENE-714: Replaced 2 cases of manual for-loop array copying
     with calls to System.arraycopy instead, in DocumentWriter.java.
     (Nicolas Lalevee via Mike McCandless)

 13. LUCENE-729: Non-recursive skipTo and next implementation of
     TermDocs for a MultiReader.  The old implementation could
     recurse up to the number of segments in the index. (Yonik Seeley)

 14. LUCENE-739: Improve segment merging performance by reusing
     the norm array across different fields and doing bulk writes
     of norms of segments with no deleted docs.
    (Michael Busch via Yonik Seeley)

 15. LUCENE-745: Add BooleanQuery.clauses(), allowing direct access
     to the List of clauses and replaced the internal synchronized Vector
     with an unsynchronized List. (Yonik Seeley)

 16. LUCENE-750: Remove finalizers from FSIndexOutput and move the
     FSIndexInput finalizer to the actual file so all clones don't
     register a new finalizer. (Yonik Seeley)

Test Cases

  1. Added TestTermScorer.java (Grant Ingersoll)

  2. Added TestWindowsMMap.java (Benson Margulies via Mike McCandless)

  3. LUCENE-744 Append the user.name property onto the temporary directory 
     that is created so it doesn't interfere with other users. (Grant Ingersoll)

Documentation

  1. Added style sheet to xdocs named lucene.css and included in the
     Anakia VSL descriptor.  (Grant Ingersoll)

  2. Added scoring.xml document into xdocs.  Updated Similarity.java
     scoring formula.(Grant Ingersoll and Steve Rowe.  Updates from:
     Michael McCandless, Doron Cohen, Chris Hostetter, Doug Cutting).
     Issue 664.

  3. Added javadocs for FieldSelectorResult.java. (Grant Ingersoll)

  4. Moved xdocs directory to src/site/src/documentation/content/xdocs per
     Issue 707.  Site now builds using Forrest, just like the other Lucene
     siblings.  See http://wiki.apache.org/jakarta-lucene/HowToUpdateTheWebsite
     for info on updating the website. (Grant Ingersoll with help from Steve Rowe,
     Chris Hostetter, Doug Cutting, Otis Gospodnetic, Yonik Seeley)

  5. Added in Developer and System Requirements sections under Resources (Grant Ingersoll)

  6. LUCENE-713 Updated the Term Vector section of File Formats to include
     documentation on how Offset and Position info are stored in the TVF file.
     (Grant Ingersoll, Samir Abdou)

  7. Added in link to Clover Test Code Coverage Reports under the Develop
     section in Resources (Grant Ingersoll)

  8. LUCENE-748: Added details for semantics of IndexWriter.close on
     hitting an Exception.  (Jed Wesley-Smith via Mike McCandless)

  9. Added some text about what is contained in releases.
     (Eric Haszlakiewicz via Grant Ingersoll)

  10. LUCENE-758: Fix javadoc to clarify that RAMDirectory(Directory)
      makes a full copy of the starting Directory.  (Mike McCandless)

  11. LUCENE-764: Fix javadocs to detail temporary space requirements
      for IndexWriter's optimize(), addIndexes(*) and addDocument(...)
      methods.  (Mike McCandless)

Build

  1. Added in clover test code coverage per http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-721
     To enable clover code coverage, you must have clover.jar in the ANT
     classpath and specify -Drun.clover=true on the command line.
     (Michael Busch and Grant Ingersoll)

  2. Added a sysproperty in common-build.xml per Lucene 752 to map java.io.tmpdir to
     ${build.dir}/test just like the tempDir sysproperty.

  3. LUCENE-757 Added new target named init-dist that does setup for
     distribution of both binary and source distributions.  Called by package 
     and package-*-src

======================= Release 2.0.0 2006-05-26 =======================

API Changes

 1. All deprecated methods and fields have been removed, except
    DateField, which will still be supported for some time
    so Lucene can read its date fields from old indexes
    (Yonik Seeley & Grant Ingersoll)

 2. DisjunctionSumScorer is no longer public.
    (Paul Elschot via Otis Gospodnetic)

 3. Creating a Field with both an empty name and an empty value
    now throws an IllegalArgumentException
    (Daniel Naber)

 4. LUCENE-301: Added new IndexWriter({String,File,Directory},
    Analyzer) constructors that do not take a boolean "create"
    argument.  These new constructors will create a new index if
    necessary, else append to the existing one.  (Dan Armbrust via
    Mike McCandless)

New features

 1. LUCENE-496: Command line tool for modifying the field norms of an
    existing index; added to contrib/miscellaneous.  (Chris Hostetter)

 2. LUCENE-577: SweetSpotSimilarity added to contrib/miscellaneous.
    (Chris Hostetter)
    
Bug fixes

 1. LUCENE-330: Fix issue of FilteredQuery not working properly within
    BooleanQuery.  (Paul Elschot via Erik Hatcher)

 2. LUCENE-515: Make ConstantScoreRangeQuery and ConstantScoreQuery work
    with RemoteSearchable.  (Philippe Laflamme via Yonik Seeley)

 3. Added methods to get/set writeLockTimeout and commitLockTimeout in
    IndexWriter. These could be set in Lucene 1.4 using a system property.
    This feature had been removed without adding the corresponding
    getter/setter methods.  (Daniel Naber)

 4. LUCENE-413: Fixed ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException exceptions
    when using SpanQueries. (Paul Elschot via Yonik Seeley)

 5. Implemented FilterIndexReader.getVersion() and isCurrent()
    (Yonik Seeley)

 6. LUCENE-540: Fixed a bug with IndexWriter.addIndexes(Directory[])
    that sometimes caused the index order of documents to change.
    (Yonik Seeley)

 7. LUCENE-526: Fixed a bug in FieldSortedHitQueue that caused
    subsequent String sorts with different locales to sort identically.
    (Paul Cowan via Yonik Seeley)

 8. LUCENE-541: Add missing extractTerms() to DisjunctionMaxQuery
    (Stefan Will via Yonik Seeley)

 9. LUCENE-514: Added getTermArrays() and extractTerms() to
    MultiPhraseQuery (Eric Jain & Yonik Seeley)

10. LUCENE-512: Fixed ClassCastException in ParallelReader.getTermFreqVectors
    (frederic via Yonik)

11. LUCENE-352: Fixed bug in SpanNotQuery that manifested as
    NullPointerException when "exclude" query was not a SpanTermQuery.
    (Chris Hostetter)

12. LUCENE-572: Fixed bug in SpanNotQuery hashCode, was ignoring exclude clause
    (Chris Hostetter)

13. LUCENE-561: Fixed some ParallelReader bugs. NullPointerException if the reader
    didn't know about the field yet, reader didn't keep track if it had deletions,
    and deleteDocument calls could circumvent synchronization on the subreaders.
    (Chuck Williams via Yonik Seeley)

14. LUCENE-556: Added empty extractTerms() implementation to MatchAllDocsQuery and
    ConstantScoreQuery in order to allow their use with a MultiSearcher.
    (Yonik Seeley)

15. LUCENE-546: Removed 2GB file size limitations for RAMDirectory.
    (Peter Royal, Michael Chan, Yonik Seeley)

16. LUCENE-485: Don't hold commit lock while removing obsolete index
    files.  (Luc Vanlerberghe via cutting)


1.9.1

Bug fixes

 1. LUCENE-511: Fix a bug in the BufferedIndexOutput optimization
    introduced in 1.9-final.  (Shay Banon & Steven Tamm via cutting)

1.9 final

Note that this release is mostly but not 100% source compatible with
the previous release of Lucene (1.4.3). In other words, you should
make sure your application compiles with this version of Lucene before
you replace the old Lucene JAR with the new one.  Many methods have
been deprecated in anticipation of release 2.0, so deprecation
warnings are to be expected when upgrading from 1.4.3 to 1.9.

Bug fixes
 
 1. The fix that made IndexWriter.setMaxBufferedDocs(1) work had negative 
    effects on indexing performance and has thus been reverted. The 
    argument for setMaxBufferedDocs(int) must now at least be 2, otherwise
    an exception is thrown. (Daniel Naber)
 
Optimizations
     
 1. Optimized BufferedIndexOutput.writeBytes() to use
    System.arraycopy() in more cases, rather than copying byte-by-byte.
    (Lukas Zapletal via Cutting)

1.9 RC1

Requirements

 1. To compile and use Lucene you now need Java 1.4 or later.

Changes in runtime behavior

 1. FuzzyQuery can no longer throw a TooManyClauses exception. If a
    FuzzyQuery expands to more than BooleanQuery.maxClauseCount
    terms only the BooleanQuery.maxClauseCount most similar terms
    go into the rewritten query and thus the exception is avoided.
    (Christoph)

 2. Changed system property from "org.apache.lucene.lockdir" to
    "org.apache.lucene.lockDir", so that its casing follows the existing
    pattern used in other Lucene system properties. (Bernhard)

 3. The terms of RangeQueries and FuzzyQueries are now converted to
    lowercase by default (as it has been the case for PrefixQueries
    and WildcardQueries before). Use setLowercaseExpandedTerms(false)
    to disable that behavior but note that this also affects
    PrefixQueries and WildcardQueries. (Daniel Naber)

 4. Document frequency that is computed when MultiSearcher is used is now
    computed correctly and "globally" across subsearchers and indices, while
    before it used to be computed locally to each index, which caused
    ranking across multiple indices not to be equivalent.
    (Chuck Williams, Wolf Siberski via Otis, bug #31841)

 5. When opening an IndexWriter with create=true, Lucene now only deletes
    its own files from the index directory (looking at the file name suffixes
    to decide if a file belongs to Lucene). The old behavior was to delete
    all files. (Daniel Naber and Bernhard Messer, bug #34695)

 6. The version of an IndexReader, as returned by getCurrentVersion()
    and getVersion() doesn't start at 0 anymore for new indexes. Instead, it
    is now initialized by the system time in milliseconds.
    (Bernhard Messer via Daniel Naber)

 7. Several default values cannot be set via system properties anymore, as
    this has been considered inappropriate for a library like Lucene. For
    most properties there are set/get methods available in IndexWriter which
    you should use instead. This affects the following properties:
    See IndexWriter for getter/setter methods:
      org.apache.lucene.writeLockTimeout, org.apache.lucene.commitLockTimeout,
      org.apache.lucene.minMergeDocs, org.apache.lucene.maxMergeDocs,
      org.apache.lucene.maxFieldLength, org.apache.lucene.termIndexInterval,
      org.apache.lucene.mergeFactor,
    See BooleanQuery for getter/setter methods:
      org.apache.lucene.maxClauseCount
    See FSDirectory for getter/setter methods:
      disableLuceneLocks
    (Daniel Naber)

 8. Fixed FieldCacheImpl to use user-provided IntParser and FloatParser,
    instead of using Integer and Float classes for parsing.
    (Yonik Seeley via Otis Gospodnetic)

 9. Expert level search routines returning TopDocs and TopFieldDocs
    no longer normalize scores.  This also fixes bugs related to
    MultiSearchers and score sorting/normalization.
    (Luc Vanlerberghe via Yonik Seeley, LUCENE-469)

New features

 1. Added support for stored compressed fields (patch #31149)
    (Bernhard Messer via Christoph)

 2. Added support for binary stored fields (patch #29370)
    (Drew Farris and Bernhard Messer via Christoph)

 3. Added support for position and offset information in term vectors
    (patch #18927). (Grant Ingersoll & Christoph)

 4. A new class DateTools has been added. It allows you to format dates
    in a readable format adequate for indexing. Unlike the existing
    DateField class DateTools can cope with dates before 1970 and it
    forces you to specify the desired date resolution (e.g. month, day,
    second, ...) which can make RangeQuerys on those fields more efficient.
    (Daniel Naber)

 5. QueryParser now correctly works with Analyzers that can return more
    than one token per position. For example, a query "+fast +car"
    would be parsed as "+fast +(car automobile)" if the Analyzer
    returns "car" and "automobile" at the same position whenever it
    finds "car" (Patch #23307).
    (Pierrick Brihaye, Daniel Naber)

 6. Permit unbuffered Directory implementations (e.g., using mmap).
    InputStream is replaced by the new classes IndexInput and
    BufferedIndexInput.  OutputStream is replaced by the new classes
    IndexOutput and BufferedIndexOutput.  InputStream and OutputStream
    are now deprecated and FSDirectory is now subclassable. (cutting)

 7. Add native Directory and TermDocs implementations that work under
    GCJ.  These require GCC 3.4.0 or later and have only been tested
    on Linux.  Use 'ant gcj' to build demo applications. (cutting)

 8. Add MMapDirectory, which uses nio to mmap input files.  This is
    still somewhat slower than FSDirectory.  However it uses less
    memory per query term, since a new buffer is not allocated per
    term, which may help applications which use, e.g., wildcard
    queries.  It may also someday be faster. (cutting & Paul Elschot)

 9. Added javadocs-internal to build.xml - bug #30360
    (Paul Elschot via Otis)

10. Added RangeFilter, a more generically useful filter than DateFilter.
    (Chris M Hostetter via Erik)

11. Added NumberTools, a utility class indexing numeric fields.
    (adapted from code contributed by Matt Quail; committed by Erik)

12. Added public static IndexReader.main(String[] args) method.
    IndexReader can now be used directly at command line level
    to list and optionally extract the individual files from an existing
    compound index file.
    (adapted from code contributed by Garrett Rooney; committed by Bernhard)

13. Add IndexWriter.setTermIndexInterval() method.  See javadocs.
    (Doug Cutting)

14. Added LucenePackage, whose static get() method returns java.util.Package,
    which lets the caller get the Lucene version information specified in
    the Lucene Jar.
    (Doug Cutting via Otis)

15. Added Hits.iterator() method and corresponding HitIterator and Hit objects.
    This provides standard java.util.Iterator iteration over Hits.
    Each call to the iterator's next() method returns a Hit object.
    (Jeremy Rayner via Erik)

16. Add ParallelReader, an IndexReader that combines separate indexes
    over different fields into a single virtual index.  (Doug Cutting)

17. Add IntParser and FloatParser interfaces to FieldCache, so that
    fields in arbitrarily formats can be cached as ints and floats.
    (Doug Cutting)

18. Added class org.apache.lucene.index.IndexModifier which combines
    IndexWriter and IndexReader, so you can add and delete documents without
    worrying about synchronization/locking issues.
    (Daniel Naber)

19. Lucene can now be used inside an unsigned applet, as Lucene's access
    to system properties will not cause a SecurityException anymore.
    (Jon Schuster via Daniel Naber, bug #34359)

20. Added a new class MatchAllDocsQuery that matches all documents.
    (John Wang via Daniel Naber, bug #34946)

21. Added ability to omit norms on a per field basis to decrease
    index size and memory consumption when there are many indexed fields.
    See Field.setOmitNorms()
    (Yonik Seeley, LUCENE-448)

22. Added NullFragmenter to contrib/highlighter, which is useful for
    highlighting entire documents or fields.
    (Erik Hatcher)

23. Added regular expression queries, RegexQuery and SpanRegexQuery.
    Note the same term enumeration caveats apply with these queries as
    apply to WildcardQuery and other term expanding queries.
    These two new queries are not currently supported via QueryParser.
    (Erik Hatcher)

24. Added ConstantScoreQuery which wraps a filter and produces a score
    equal to the query boost for every matching document.
    (Yonik Seeley, LUCENE-383)

25. Added ConstantScoreRangeQuery which produces a constant score for
    every document in the range.  One advantage over a normal RangeQuery
    is that it doesn't expand to a BooleanQuery and thus doesn't have a maximum
    number of terms the range can cover.  Both endpoints may also be open.
    (Yonik Seeley, LUCENE-383)

26. Added ability to specify a minimum number of optional clauses that
    must match in a BooleanQuery.  See BooleanQuery.setMinimumNumberShouldMatch().
    (Paul Elschot, Chris Hostetter via Yonik Seeley, LUCENE-395)

27. Added DisjunctionMaxQuery which provides the maximum score across its clauses.
    It's very useful for searching across multiple fields.
    (Chuck Williams via Yonik Seeley, LUCENE-323)

28. New class ISOLatin1AccentFilter that replaces accented characters in the ISO
    Latin 1 character set by their unaccented equivalent.
    (Sven Duzont via Erik Hatcher)

29. New class KeywordAnalyzer. "Tokenizes" the entire stream as a single token.
    This is useful for data like zip codes, ids, and some product names.
    (Erik Hatcher)

30. Copied LengthFilter from contrib area to core. Removes words that are too
    long and too short from the stream.
    (David Spencer via Otis and Daniel)

31. Added getPositionIncrementGap(String fieldName) to Analyzer.  This allows
    custom analyzers to put gaps between Field instances with the same field
    name, preventing phrase or span queries crossing these boundaries.  The
    default implementation issues a gap of 0, allowing the default token
    position increment of 1 to put the next field's first token into a
    successive position.
    (Erik Hatcher, with advice from Yonik)

32. StopFilter can now ignore case when checking for stop words.
    (Grant Ingersoll via Yonik, LUCENE-248)

33. Add TopDocCollector and TopFieldDocCollector.  These simplify the
    implementation of hit collectors that collect only the
    top-scoring or top-sorting hits.

API Changes

 1. Several methods and fields have been deprecated. The API documentation
    contains information about the recommended replacements. It is planned
    that most of the deprecated methods and fields will be removed in
    Lucene 2.0. (Daniel Naber)

 2. The Russian and the German analyzers have been moved to contrib/analyzers.
    Also, the WordlistLoader class has been moved one level up in the
    hierarchy and is now org.apache.lucene.analysis.WordlistLoader
    (Daniel Naber)

 3. The API contained methods that declared to throw an IOException
    but that never did this. These declarations have been removed. If
    your code tries to catch these exceptions you might need to remove
    those catch clauses to avoid compile errors. (Daniel Naber)

 4. Add a serializable Parameter Class to standardize parameter enum
    classes in BooleanClause and Field. (Christoph)

 5. Added rewrite methods to all SpanQuery subclasses that nest other SpanQuerys.
    This allows custom SpanQuery subclasses that rewrite (for term expansion, for
    example) to nest within the built-in SpanQuery classes successfully.

Bug fixes

 1. The JSP demo page (src/jsp/results.jsp) now properly closes the
    IndexSearcher it opens. (Daniel Naber)

 2. Fixed a bug in IndexWriter.addIndexes(IndexReader[] readers) that
    prevented deletion of obsolete segments. (Christoph Goller)

 3. Fix in FieldInfos to avoid the return of an extra blank field in
    IndexReader.getFieldNames() (Patch #19058). (Mark Harwood via Bernhard)

 4. Some combinations of BooleanQuery and MultiPhraseQuery (formerly
    PhrasePrefixQuery) could provoke UnsupportedOperationException
    (bug #33161). (Rhett Sutphin via Daniel Naber)

 5. Small bug in skipTo of ConjunctionScorer that caused NullPointerException
    if skipTo() was called without prior call to next() fixed. (Christoph)

 6. Disable Similiarty.coord() in the scoring of most automatically
    generated boolean queries.  The coord() score factor is
    appropriate when clauses are independently specified by a user,
    but is usually not appropriate when clauses are generated
    automatically, e.g., by a fuzzy, wildcard or range query.  Matches
    on such automatically generated queries are no longer penalized
    for not matching all terms.  (Doug Cutting, Patch #33472)

 7. Getting a lock file with Lock.obtain(long) was supposed to wait for
    a given amount of milliseconds, but this didn't work.
    (John Wang via Daniel Naber, Bug #33799)

 8. Fix FSDirectory.createOutput() to always create new files.
    Previously, existing files were overwritten, and an index could be
    corrupted when the old version of a file was longer than the new.
    Now any existing file is first removed.  (Doug Cutting)

 9. Fix BooleanQuery containing nested SpanTermQuery's, which previously
    could return an incorrect number of hits.
    (Reece Wilton via Erik Hatcher, Bug #35157)

10. Fix NullPointerException that could occur with a MultiPhraseQuery
    inside a BooleanQuery.
    (Hans Hjelm and Scotty Allen via Daniel Naber, Bug #35626)

11. Fixed SnowballFilter to pass through the position increment from
    the original token.
    (Yonik Seeley via Erik Hatcher, LUCENE-437)

12. Added Unicode range of Korean characters to StandardTokenizer,
    grouping contiguous characters into a token rather than one token
    per character.  This change also changes the token type to "<CJ>"
    for Chinese and Japanese character tokens (previously it was "<CJK>").
    (Cheolgoo Kang via Otis and Erik, LUCENE-444 and LUCENE-461)

13. FieldsReader now looks at FieldInfo.storeOffsetWithTermVector and
    FieldInfo.storePositionWithTermVector and creates the Field with
    correct TermVector parameter.
    (Frank Steinmann via Bernhard, LUCENE-455)

14. Fixed WildcardQuery to prevent "cat" matching "ca??".
    (Xiaozheng Ma via Bernhard, LUCENE-306)

15. Fixed a bug where MultiSearcher and ParallelMultiSearcher could
    change the sort order when sorting by string for documents without
    a value for the sort field.
    (Luc Vanlerberghe via Yonik, LUCENE-453)

16. Fixed a sorting problem with MultiSearchers that can lead to
    missing or duplicate docs due to equal docs sorting in an arbitrary order.
    (Yonik Seeley, LUCENE-456)

17. A single hit using the expert level sorted search methods
    resulted in the score not being normalized.
    (Yonik Seeley, LUCENE-462)

18. Fixed inefficient memory usage when loading an index into RAMDirectory.
    (Volodymyr Bychkoviak via Bernhard, LUCENE-475)

19. Corrected term offsets returned by ChineseTokenizer.
    (Ray Tsang via Erik Hatcher, LUCENE-324)

20. Fixed MultiReader.undeleteAll() to correctly update numDocs.
    (Robert Kirchgessner via Doug Cutting, LUCENE-479)

21. Race condition in IndexReader.getCurrentVersion() and isCurrent()
    fixed by acquiring the commit lock.
    (Luc Vanlerberghe via Yonik Seeley, LUCENE-481)

22. IndexWriter.setMaxBufferedDocs(1) didn't have the expected effect,
    this has now been fixed. (Daniel Naber)

23. Fixed QueryParser when called with a date in local form like 
    "[1/16/2000 TO 1/18/2000]". This query did not include the documents
    of 1/18/2000, i.e. the last day was not included. (Daniel Naber)

24. Removed sorting constraint that threw an exception if there were
    not yet any values for the sort field (Yonik Seeley, LUCENE-374)

Optimizations
     
 1. Disk usage (peak requirements during indexing and optimization)
    in case of compound file format has been improved. 
    (Bernhard, Dmitry, and Christoph)

 2. Optimize the performance of certain uses of BooleanScorer,
    TermScorer and IndexSearcher.  In particular, a BooleanQuery
    composed of TermQuery, with not all terms required, that returns a
    TopDocs (e.g., through a Hits with no Sort specified) runs much
    faster.  (cutting)
    
 3. Removed synchronization from reading of term vectors with an
    IndexReader (Patch #30736). (Bernhard Messer via Christoph)

 4. Optimize term-dictionary lookup to allocate far fewer terms when
    scanning for the matching term.  This speeds searches involving
    low-frequency terms, where the cost of dictionary lookup can be
    significant. (cutting)

 5. Optimize fuzzy queries so the standard fuzzy queries with a prefix 
    of 0 now run 20-50% faster (Patch #31882).
    (Jonathan Hager via Daniel Naber)
    
 6. A Version of BooleanScorer (BooleanScorer2) added that delivers
    documents in increasing order and implements skipTo. For queries
    with required or forbidden clauses it may be faster than the old
    BooleanScorer, for BooleanQueries consisting only of optional
    clauses it is probably slower. The new BooleanScorer is now the
    default. (Patch 31785 by Paul Elschot via Christoph)

 7. Use uncached access to norms when merging to reduce RAM usage.
    (Bug #32847).  (Doug Cutting)

 8. Don't read term index when random-access is not required.  This
    reduces time to open IndexReaders and they use less memory when
    random access is not required, e.g., when merging segments.  The
    term index is now read into memory lazily at the first
    random-access.  (Doug Cutting)

 9. Optimize IndexWriter.addIndexes(Directory[]) when the number of
    added indexes is larger than mergeFactor.  Previously this could
    result in quadratic performance.  Now performance is n log(n).
    (Doug Cutting)

10. Speed up the creation of TermEnum for indices with multiple
    segments and deleted documents, and thus speed up PrefixQuery,
    RangeQuery, WildcardQuery, FuzzyQuery, RangeFilter, DateFilter,
    and sorting the first time on a field.
    (Yonik Seeley, LUCENE-454)

11. Optimized and generalized 32 bit floating point to byte
    (custom 8 bit floating point) conversions.  Increased the speed of
    Similarity.encodeNorm() anywhere from 10% to 250%, depending on the JVM.
    (Yonik Seeley, LUCENE-467)

Infrastructure

 1. Lucene's source code repository has converted from CVS to
    Subversion.  The new repository is at
    http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/lucene/java/trunk

 2. Lucene's issue tracker has migrated from Bugzilla to JIRA.
    Lucene's JIRA is at http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE
    The old issues are still available at
    http://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=xxxx
    (use the bug number instead of xxxx)


1.4.3

 1. The JSP demo page (src/jsp/results.jsp) now properly escapes error
    messages which might contain user input (e.g. error messages about 
    query parsing). If you used that page as a starting point for your
    own code please make sure your code also properly escapes HTML
    characters from user input in order to avoid so-called cross site
    scripting attacks. (Daniel Naber)
  
  2. QueryParser changes in 1.4.2 broke the QueryParser API. Now the old 
     API is supported again. (Christoph)


1.4.2

 1. Fixed bug #31241: Sorting could lead to incorrect results (documents
    missing, others duplicated) if the sort keys were not unique and there
    were more than 100 matches. (Daniel Naber)

 2. Memory leak in Sort code (bug #31240) eliminated.
    (Rafal Krzewski via Christoph and Daniel)
    
 3. FuzzyQuery now takes an additional parameter that specifies the
    minimum similarity that is required for a term to match the query.
    The QueryParser syntax for this is term~x, where x is a floating 
    point number >= 0 and < 1 (a bigger number means that a higher
    similarity is required). Furthermore, a prefix can be specified
    for FuzzyQuerys so that only those terms are considered similar that 
    start with this prefix. This can speed up FuzzyQuery greatly.
    (Daniel Naber, Christoph Goller)
    
 4. PhraseQuery and PhrasePrefixQuery now allow the explicit specification
    of relative positions. (Christoph Goller)
    
 5. QueryParser changes: Fix for ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsExceptions 
    (patch #9110); some unused method parameters removed; The ability
    to specify a minimum similarity for FuzzyQuery has been added.
    (Christoph Goller)

 6. IndexSearcher optimization: a new ScoreDoc is no longer allocated
    for every non-zero-scoring hit.  This makes 'OR' queries that
    contain common terms substantially faster.  (cutting)


1.4.1

 1. Fixed a performance bug in hit sorting code, where values were not
    correctly cached.  (Aviran via cutting)

 2. Fixed errors in file format documentation. (Daniel Naber)


1.4 final

 1. Added "an" to the list of stop words in StopAnalyzer, to complement
    the existing "a" there.  Fix for bug 28960
     (http://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=28960). (Otis)

 2. Added new class FieldCache to manage in-memory caches of field term
    values.  (Tim Jones)

 3. Added overloaded getFieldQuery method to QueryParser which
    accepts the slop factor specified for the phrase (or the default
    phrase slop for the QueryParser instance).  This allows overriding
    methods to replace a PhraseQuery with a SpanNearQuery instead,
    keeping the proper slop factor. (Erik Hatcher)

 4. Changed the encoding of GermanAnalyzer.java and GermanStemmer.java to
    UTF-8 and changed the build encoding to UTF-8, to make changed files
    compile. (Otis Gospodnetic)

 5. Removed synchronization from term lookup under IndexReader methods
    termFreq(), termDocs() or termPositions() to improve
    multi-threaded performance.  (cutting)

 6. Fix a bug where obsolete segment files were not deleted on Win32.


1.4 RC3

 1. Fixed several search bugs introduced by the skipTo() changes in
    release 1.4RC1.  The index file format was changed a bit, so
    collections must be re-indexed to take advantage of the skipTo()
    optimizations.  (Christoph Goller)

 2. Added new Document methods, removeField() and removeFields().
    (Christoph Goller)

 3. Fixed inconsistencies with index closing.  Indexes and directories
    are now only closed automatically by Lucene when Lucene opened
    them automatically.  (Christoph Goller)

 4. Added new class: FilteredQuery.  (Tim Jones)

 5. Added a new SortField type for custom comparators.  (Tim Jones)

 6. Lock obtain timed out message now displays the full path to the lock
    file. (Daniel Naber via Erik)

 7. Fixed a bug in SpanNearQuery when ordered. (Paul Elschot via cutting)

 8. Fixed so that FSDirectory's locks still work when the
    java.io.tmpdir system property is null.  (cutting)

 9. Changed FilteredTermEnum's constructor to take no parameters,
    as the parameters were ignored anyway (bug #28858)

1.4 RC2

 1. GermanAnalyzer now throws an exception if the stopword file
    cannot be found (bug #27987). It now uses LowerCaseFilter
    (bug #18410) (Daniel Naber via Otis, Erik)

 2. Fixed a few bugs in the file format documentation. (cutting)


1.4 RC1

 1. Changed the format of the .tis file, so that:

    - it has a format version number, which makes it easier to
      back-compatibly change file formats in the future.

    - the term count is now stored as a long.  This was the one aspect
      of the Lucene's file formats which limited index size.

    - a few internal index parameters are now stored in the index, so
      that they can (in theory) now be changed from index to index,
      although there is not yet an API to do so.

    These changes are back compatible.  The new code can read old
    indexes.  But old code will not be able read new indexes. (cutting)

 2. Added an optimized implementation of TermDocs.skipTo().  A skip
    table is now stored for each term in the .frq file.  This only
    adds a percent or two to overall index size, but can substantially
    speedup many searches.  (cutting)

 3. Restructured the Scorer API and all Scorer implementations to take
    advantage of an optimized TermDocs.skipTo() implementation.  In
    particular, PhraseQuerys and conjunctive BooleanQuerys are
    faster when one clause has substantially fewer matches than the
    others.  (A conjunctive BooleanQuery is a BooleanQuery where all
    clauses are required.)  (cutting)

 4. Added new class ParallelMultiSearcher.  Combined with
    RemoteSearchable this makes it easy to implement distributed
    search systems.  (Jean-Francois Halleux via cutting)

 5. Added support for hit sorting.  Results may now be sorted by any
    indexed field.  For details see the javadoc for
    Searcher#search(Query, Sort).  (Tim Jones via Cutting)

 6. Changed FSDirectory to auto-create a full directory tree that it
    needs by using mkdirs() instead of mkdir().  (Mladen Turk via Otis)

 7. Added a new span-based query API.  This implements, among other
    things, nested phrases.  See javadocs for details.  (Doug Cutting)

 8. Added new method Query.getSimilarity(Searcher), and changed
    scorers to use it.  This permits one to subclass a Query class so
    that it can specify its own Similarity implementation, perhaps
    one that delegates through that of the Searcher.  (Julien Nioche
    via Cutting)

 9. Added MultiReader, an IndexReader that combines multiple other
    IndexReaders.  (Cutting)

10. Added support for term vectors.  See Field#isTermVectorStored().
    (Grant Ingersoll, Cutting & Dmitry)

11. Fixed the old bug with escaping of special characters in query
    strings: http://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=24665
    (Jean-Francois Halleux via Otis)

12. Added support for overriding default values for the following,
    using system properties:
      - default commit lock timeout
      - default maxFieldLength
      - default maxMergeDocs
      - default mergeFactor
      - default minMergeDocs
      - default write lock timeout
    (Otis)

13. Changed QueryParser.jj to allow '-' and '+' within tokens:
    http://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=27491
    (Morus Walter via Otis)

14. Changed so that the compound index format is used by default.
    This makes indexing a bit slower, but vastly reduces the chances
    of file handle problems.  (Cutting)


1.3 final

 1. Added catch of BooleanQuery$TooManyClauses in QueryParser to
    throw ParseException instead. (Erik Hatcher)

 2. Fixed a NullPointerException in Query.explain(). (Doug Cutting)

 3. Added a new method IndexReader.setNorm(), that permits one to
    alter the boosting of fields after an index is created.

 4. Distinguish between the final position and length when indexing a
    field.  The length is now defined as the total number of tokens,
    instead of the final position, as it was previously.  Length is
    used for score normalization (Similarity.lengthNorm()) and for
    controlling memory usage (IndexWriter.maxFieldLength).  In both of
    these cases, the total number of tokens is a better value to use
    than the final token position.  Position is used in phrase
    searching (see PhraseQuery and Token.setPositionIncrement()).

 5. Fix StandardTokenizer's handling of CJK characters (Chinese,
    Japanese and Korean ideograms).  Previously contiguous sequences
    were combined in a single token, which is not very useful.  Now
    each ideogram generates a separate token, which is more useful.


1.3 RC3

 1. Added minMergeDocs in IndexWriter.  This can be raised to speed
    indexing without altering the number of files, but only using more
    memory.  (Julien Nioche via Otis)

 2. Fix bug #24786, in query rewriting. (bschneeman via Cutting)

 3. Fix bug #16952, in demo HTML parser, skip comments in
    javascript. (Christoph Goller)

 4. Fix bug #19253, in demo HTML parser, add whitespace as needed to
    output (Daniel Naber via Christoph Goller)

 5. Fix bug #24301, in demo HTML parser, long titles no longer
    hang things. (Christoph Goller)

 6. Fix bug #23534, Replace use of file timestamp of segments file
    with an index version number stored in the segments file.  This
    resolves problems when running on file systems with low-resolution
    timestamps, e.g., HFS under MacOS X.  (Christoph Goller)

 7. Fix QueryParser so that TokenMgrError is not thrown, only
    ParseException.  (Erik Hatcher)

 8. Fix some bugs introduced by change 11 of RC2.  (Christoph Goller)

 9. Fixed a problem compiling TestRussianStem.  (Christoph Goller)

10. Cleaned up some build stuff.  (Erik Hatcher)


1.3 RC2

 1. Added getFieldNames(boolean) to IndexReader, SegmentReader, and
    SegmentsReader. (Julien Nioche via otis)

 2. Changed file locking to place lock files in
    System.getProperty("java.io.tmpdir"), where all users are
    permitted to write files.  This way folks can open and correctly
    lock indexes which are read-only to them.

 3. IndexWriter: added a new method, addDocument(Document, Analyzer),
    permitting one to easily use different analyzers for different
    documents in the same index.

 4. Minor enhancements to FuzzyTermEnum.
    (Christoph Goller via Otis)

 5. PriorityQueue: added insert(Object) method and adjusted IndexSearcher
    and MultiIndexSearcher to use it.
    (Christoph Goller via Otis)

 6. Fixed a bug in IndexWriter that returned incorrect docCount().
    (Christoph Goller via Otis)

 7. Fixed SegmentsReader to eliminate the confusing and slightly different
    behaviour of TermEnum when dealing with an enumeration of all terms,
    versus an enumeration starting from a specific term.
    This patch also fixes incorrect term document frequencies when the same term
    is present in multiple segments.
    (Christoph Goller via Otis)

 8. Added CachingWrapperFilter and PerFieldAnalyzerWrapper. (Erik Hatcher)

 9. Added support for the new "compound file" index format (Dmitry
    Serebrennikov)

10. Added Locale setting to QueryParser, for use by date range parsing.

11. Changed IndexReader so that it can be subclassed by classes
    outside of its package.  Previously it had package-private
    abstract methods.  Also modified the index merging code so that it
    can work on an arbitrary IndexReader implementation, and added a
    new method, IndexWriter.addIndexes(IndexReader[]), to take
    advantage of this. (cutting)

12. Added a limit to the number of clauses which may be added to a
    BooleanQuery.  The default limit is 1024 clauses.  This should
    stop most OutOfMemoryExceptions by prefix, wildcard and fuzzy
    queries which run amok. (cutting)

13. Add new method: IndexReader.undeleteAll().  This undeletes all
    deleted documents which still remain in the index. (cutting)


1.3 RC1

 1. Fixed PriorityQueue's clear() method.
    Fix for bug 9454, http://nagoya.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=9454
    (Matthijs Bomhoff via otis)

 2. Changed StandardTokenizer.jj grammar for EMAIL tokens.
    Fix for bug 9015, http://nagoya.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=9015
    (Dale Anson via otis)

 3. Added the ability to disable lock creation by using disableLuceneLocks
    system property.  This is useful for read-only media, such as CD-ROMs.
    (otis)

 4. Added id method to Hits to be able to access the index global id.
    Required for sorting options.
    (carlson)

 5. Added support for new range query syntax to QueryParser.jj.
    (briangoetz)

 6. Added the ability to retrieve HTML documents' META tag values to
    HTMLParser.jj.
    (Mark Harwood via otis)

 7. Modified QueryParser to make it possible to programmatically specify the
    default Boolean operator (OR or AND).
    (Péter Halácsy via otis)

 8. Made many search methods and classes non-final, per requests.
    This includes IndexWriter and IndexSearcher, among others.
    (cutting)

 9. Added class RemoteSearchable, providing support for remote
    searching via RMI.  The test class RemoteSearchableTest.java
    provides an example of how this can be used.  (cutting)

 10. Added PhrasePrefixQuery (and supporting MultipleTermPositions).  The
     test class TestPhrasePrefixQuery provides the usage example.
     (Anders Nielsen via otis)

 11. Changed the German stemming algorithm to ignore case while
     stripping. The new algorithm is faster and produces more equal
     stems from nouns and verbs derived from the same word.
     (gschwarz)

 12. Added support for boosting the score of documents and fields via
     the new methods Document.setBoost(float) and Field.setBoost(float).

     Note: This changes the encoding of an indexed value.  Indexes
     should be re-created from scratch in order for search scores to
     be correct.  With the new code and an old index, searches will
     yield very large scores for shorter fields, and very small scores
     for longer fields.  Once the index is re-created, scores will be
     as before. (cutting)

 13. Added new method Token.setPositionIncrement().

     This permits, for the purpose of phrase searching, placing
     multiple terms in a single position.  This is useful with
     stemmers that produce multiple possible stems for a word.

     This also permits the introduction of gaps between terms, so that
     terms which are adjacent in a token stream will not be matched by
     and exact phrase query.  This makes it possible, e.g., to build
     an analyzer where phrases are not matched over stop words which
     have been removed.

     Finally, repeating a token with an increment of zero can also be
     used to boost scores of matches on that token.  (cutting)

 14. Added new Filter class, QueryFilter.  This constrains search
     results to only match those which also match a provided query.
     Results are cached, so that searches after the first on the same
     index using this filter are very fast.

     This could be used, for example, with a RangeQuery on a formatted
     date field to implement date filtering.  One could re-use a
     single QueryFilter that matches, e.g., only documents modified
     within the last week.  The QueryFilter and RangeQuery would only
     need to be reconstructed once per day. (cutting)

 15. Added a new IndexWriter method, getAnalyzer().  This returns the
     analyzer used when adding documents to this index. (cutting)

 16. Fixed a bug with IndexReader.lastModified().  Before, document
     deletion did not update this.  Now it does.  (cutting)

 17. Added Russian Analyzer.
     (Boris Okner via otis)

 18. Added a public, extensible scoring API.  For details, see the
     javadoc for org.apache.lucene.search.Similarity.

 19. Fixed return of Hits.id() from float to int. (Terry Steichen via Peter).

 20. Added getFieldNames() to IndexReader and Segment(s)Reader classes.
     (Peter Mularien via otis)

 21. Added getFields(String) and getValues(String) methods.
     Contributed by Rasik Pandey on 2002-10-09
     (Rasik Pandey via otis)

 22. Revised internal search APIs.  Changes include:

       a. Queries are no longer modified during a search.  This makes
       it possible, e.g., to reuse the same query instance with
       multiple indexes from multiple threads.

       b. Term-expanding queries (e.g. PrefixQuery, WildcardQuery,
       etc.)  now work correctly with MultiSearcher, fixing bugs 12619
       and 12667.

       c. Boosting BooleanQuery's now works, and is supported by the
       query parser (problem reported by Lee Mallabone).  Thus a query
       like "(+foo +bar)^2 +baz" is now supported and equivalent to
       "(+foo^2 +bar^2) +baz".

       d. New method: Query.rewrite(IndexReader).  This permits a
       query to re-write itself as an alternate, more primitive query.
       Most of the term-expanding query classes (PrefixQuery,
       WildcardQuery, etc.) are now implemented using this method.

       e. New method: Searchable.explain(Query q, int doc).  This
       returns an Explanation instance that describes how a particular
       document is scored against a query.  An explanation can be
       displayed as either plain text, with the toString() method, or
       as HTML, with the toHtml() method.  Note that computing an
       explanation is as expensive as executing the query over the
       entire index.  This is intended to be used in developing
       Similarity implementations, and, for good performance, should
       not be displayed with every hit.

       f. Scorer and Weight are public, not package protected.  It now
       possible for someone to write a Scorer implementation that is
       not in the org.apache.lucene.search package.  This is still
       fairly advanced programming, and I don't expect anyone to do
       this anytime soon, but at least now it is possible.

       g. Added public accessors to the primitive query classes
       (TermQuery, PhraseQuery and BooleanQuery), permitting access to
       their terms and clauses.

     Caution: These are extensive changes and they have not yet been
     tested extensively.  Bug reports are appreciated.
     (cutting)

 23. Added convenience RAMDirectory constructors taking File and String
     arguments, for easy FSDirectory to RAMDirectory conversion.
     (otis)

 24. Added code for manual renaming of files in FSDirectory, since it
     has been reported that java.io.File's renameTo(File) method sometimes
     fails on Windows JVMs.
     (Matt Tucker via otis)

 25. Refactored QueryParser to make it easier for people to extend it.
     Added the ability to automatically lower-case Wildcard terms in
     the QueryParser.
     (Tatu Saloranta via otis)


1.2 RC6

 1. Changed QueryParser.jj to have "?" be a special character which
    allowed it to be used as a wildcard term. Updated TestWildcard
    unit test also. (Ralf Hettesheimer via carlson)

1.2 RC5

 1. Renamed build.properties to default.properties and updated
    the BUILD.txt document to describe how to override the
    default.property settings without having to edit the file. This
    brings the build process closer to Scarab's build process.
    (jon)

 2. Added MultiFieldQueryParser class. (Kelvin Tan, via otis)

 3. Updated "powered by" links. (otis)

 4. Fixed instruction for setting up JavaCC - Bug #7017 (otis)

 5. Added throwing exception if FSDirectory could not create directory
    - Bug #6914 (Eugene Gluzberg via otis)

    LowerCaseTokenizer javadoc (otis)

 7. Added fix to avoid NullPointerException in results.jsp
    (Mark Hayes via otis)

 8. Changed Wildcard search to find 0 or more char instead of 1 or more
    (Lee Mallobone, via otis)

 9. Fixed error in offset issue in GermanStemFilter - Bug #7412
    (Rodrigo Reyes, via otis)

 10. Added unit tests for wildcard search and DateFilter (otis)

 11. Allow co-existence of indexed and non-indexed fields with the same name
     (cutting/casper, via otis)

 12. Add escape character to query parser.
     (briangoetz)

 13. Applied a patch that ensures that searches that use DateFilter
     don't throw an exception when no matches are found. (David Smiley, via
     otis)

 14. Fixed bugs in DateFilter and wildcardquery unit tests. (cutting, otis, carlson)


1.2 RC4

 1. Updated contributions section of website.
    Add XML Document #3 implementation to Document Section.
    Also added Term Highlighting to Misc Section. (carlson)

 2. Fixed NullPointerException for phrase searches containing
    unindexed terms, introduced in 1.2RC3.  (cutting)

 3. Changed document deletion code to obtain the index write lock,
    enforcing the fact that document addition and deletion cannot be
    performed concurrently.  (cutting)

 4. Various documentation cleanups.  (otis, acoliver)

 5. Updated "powered by" links.  (cutting, jon)

 6. Fixed a bug in the GermanStemmer.  (Bernhard Messer, via otis)

 7. Changed Term and Query to implement Serializable.  (scottganyo)

 8. Fixed to never delete indexes added with IndexWriter.addIndexes().
    (cutting)

 9. Upgraded to JUnit 3.7. (otis)

1.2 RC3

 1. IndexWriter: fixed a bug where adding an optimized index to an
    empty index failed.  This was encountered using addIndexes to copy
    a RAMDirectory index to an FSDirectory.

 2. RAMDirectory: fixed a bug where RAMInputStream could not read
    across more than across a single buffer boundary.

 3. Fix query parser so it accepts queries with unicode characters.
    (briangoetz)

 4. Fix query parser so that PrefixQuery is used in preference to
    WildcardQuery when there's only an asterisk at the end of the
    term.  Previously PrefixQuery would never be used.

 5. Fix tests so they compile; fix ant file so it compiles tests
    properly.  Added test cases for Analyzers and PriorityQueue.

 6. Updated demos, added Getting Started documentation. (acoliver)

 7. Added 'contributions' section to website & docs. (carlson)

 8. Removed JavaCC from source distribution for copyright reasons.
    Folks must now download this separately from metamata in order to
    compile Lucene.  (cutting)

 9. Substantially improved the performance of DateFilter by adding the
    ability to reuse TermDocs objects.  (cutting)

10. Added IndexReader methods:
      public static boolean indexExists(String directory);
      public static boolean indexExists(File directory);
      public static boolean indexExists(Directory directory);
      public static boolean isLocked(Directory directory);
      public static void unlock(Directory directory);
    (cutting, otis)

11. Fixed bugs in GermanAnalyzer (gschwarz)


1.2 RC2, 19 October 2001:
 - added sources to distribution
 - removed broken build scripts and libraries from distribution
 - SegmentsReader: fixed potential race condition
 - FSDirectory: fixed so that getDirectory(xxx,true) correctly
   erases the directory contents, even when the directory
   has already been accessed in this JVM.
 - RangeQuery: Fix issue where an inclusive range query would
   include the nearest term in the index above a non-existant
   specified upper term.
 - SegmentTermEnum: Fix NullPointerException in clone() method
   when the Term is null.
 - JDK 1.1 compatibility fix: disabled lock files for JDK 1.1,
   since they rely on a feature added in JDK 1.2.

1.2 RC1 (first Apache release), 2 October 2001:
  - packages renamed from com.lucene to org.apache.lucene
  - license switched from LGPL to Apache
  - ant-only build -- no more makefiles
  - addition of lock files--now fully thread & process safe
  - addition of German stemmer
  - MultiSearcher now supports low-level search API
  - added RangeQuery, for term-range searching
  - Analyzers can choose tokenizer based on field name
  - misc bug fixes.

1.01b (last Sourceforge release), 2 July 2001
 . a few bug fixes
 . new Query Parser
 . new prefix query (search for "foo*" matches "food")

1.0, 2000-10-04

This release fixes a few serious bugs and also includes some
performance optimizations, a stemmer, and a few other minor
enhancements.

0.04 2000-04-19

Lucene now includes a grammar-based tokenizer, StandardTokenizer.

The only tokenizer included in the previous release (LetterTokenizer)
identified terms consisting entirely of alphabetic characters.  The
new tokenizer uses a regular-expression grammar to identify more
complex classes of terms, including numbers, acronyms, email
addresses, etc.

StandardTokenizer serves two purposes:

 1. It is a much better, general purpose tokenizer for use by
    applications as is.

    The easiest way for applications to start using
    StandardTokenizer is to use StandardAnalyzer.

 2. It provides a good example of grammar-based tokenization.

    If an application has special tokenization requirements, it can
    implement a custom tokenizer by copying the directory containing
    the new tokenizer into the application and modifying it
    accordingly.

0.01, 2000-03-30

First open source release.

The code has been re-organized into a new package and directory
structure for this release.  It builds OK, but has not been tested
beyond that since the re-organization.
