                      Apache Solr Version 1.2-dev
                            Release Notes

Introduction
------------
Apache Solr is an open source enterprise search server based on the Lucene Java
search library, with XML/HTTP and JSON APIs, hit highlighting, faceted search,
caching, replication, and a web administration interface. It runs in a Java
servlet container such as Tomcat.

See http://lucene.apache.org/solr for more information.


Getting Started
---------------
You need a Java 1.5 VM or later installed.
In this release, there is an example Solr server including a bundled 
servlet container in the directory named "example".
See the tutorial at http://lucene.apache.org/solr/tutorial.html

================== Release 1.2-dev, YYYYMMDD ==================

Upgrading from Solr 1.1
-------------------------------------
IMPORTANT UPGRADE NOTE: In a master/slave configuration, all searchers/slaves
should be upgraded before the master!  If the master were to be updated
first, the older searchers would not be able to read the new index format.

Older Apache Solr installations can be upgraded by replacing
the relevant war file with the new version.  No changes to configuration
files should be needed.  

This version of Solr contains a new version of Lucene implementing
an updated index format.  This version of Solr/Lucene can still read
and update indexes in the older formats, and will convert them to the new
format on the first index change.  One change in the new index format 
is that all "norms" are kept in a single file, greatly reducing the number
of files per segment. Users of compound file indexes will want to consider
converting to the non-compound format for faster indexing and slightly better
search concurrency.

The JSON response format for facets has changed to make it easier for
clients to retain sorted order.  Use json.nl=map explicitly in clients
to get the old behavior, or add it as a default to the request handler
in solrconfig.xml

The Lucene based Solr query syntax is slightly more strict.
A ':' in a field value must be escaped or the whole value must be quoted.


Detailed Change List
--------------------

New Features
 1. SOLR-82: Default field values can be specified in the schema.xml.
    (Ryan McKinley via hossman)

 2. SOLR-89: Two new TokenFilters with corresponding Factories...
    * TrimFilter - Trims leading and trailing whitespace from Tokens
    * PatternReplaceFilter - applies a Pattern to each token in the
      stream, replacing match occurances with a specified replacement.
    (hossman)

 3. SOLR-91: allow configuration of a limit of the number of searchers 
    that can be warming in the background.  This can be used to avoid
    out-of-memory errors, or contention caused by more and more searchers
    warming in the background.  An error is thrown if the limit specified
    by maxWarmingSearchers in solrconfig.xml is exceeded. (yonik)

 4. SOLR-106: New faceting parameters that allow specification of a
    minimum count for returned facets (facet.mincount), paging through facets
    (facet.offset, facet.limit), and explicit sorting (facet.sort).
    facet.zeros is now deprecated.  (yonik)

 5. SOLR-80: Negative queries are now allowed everywhere.  Negative queries
    are generated and cached as their positive counterpart, speeding
    generation and generally resulting in smaller sets to cache.
    Set intersections in SolrIndexSearcher are more efficient,
    starting with the smallest positive set, subtracting all negative
    sets, then intersecting with all other positive sets.  (yonik)

 6. SOLR-117: Limit a field faceting to constraints with a prefix specified
    by facet.prefix or f.<field>.facet.prefix. (yonik)

 7. SOLR-107: JAVA API: Change NamedList to use Java5 generics
    and implement Iterable<Map.Entry> (Ryan McKinley via yonik)

 8. SOLR-104: Support for "Update Plugins" -- RequestHandlers that want
    access to streams of data for doing updates.  ContentStreams can come
    from the raw POST body, multi-part form data, or remote URLs.
    Included in this change is a new SolrDispatchFilter that allows
    RequestHandlers registered with names that begin with a "/" to be
    accessed using a URL structure based on that name.
    (Ryan McKinley via hossman)

 9. SOLR-126: DirectUpdateHandler2 supports autocommitting after a specified time
    (in ms), using <autoCommit><maxTime>10000</maxTime></autoCommit>.
    (Ryan McKinley via klaas).

10. SOLR-116: IndexInfoRequestHandler added. (Erik Hatcher)

11. SOLR-79: Add system property ${<sys.prop>[:<default>]} substitution for
    configuration files loaded, including schema.xml and solrconfig.xml.
    (Erik Hatcher with inspiration from Andrew Saar)

12. SOLR-149: Changes to make Solr more easily embeddable, in addition
    to logging which request handler handled each request.
    (Ryan McKinley via yonik)

13. SOLR-86: Added standalone Java-based command-line updater.
    (Erik Hatcher via Bertrand Delecretaz)

14. SOLR-152: DisMaxRequestHandler now supports configurable alternate
    behavior when q is not specified.  A "q.alt" param can be specified
    using SolrQueryParser syntax as a mechanism for specifying what query
    the dismax handler should execute if the main user query (q) is blank.
    (Ryan McKinley via hossman)

15. SOLR-158: new "qs" (Query Slop) param for DisMaxRequestHandler
    allows for specifying the amount of default slop to use when parsing
    explicit phrase queries from the user.
    (Adam Hiatt via hossman)

16. SOLR-81: SpellCheckerRequestHandler that uses the SpellChecker from
    the Lucene contrib.
    (Otis Gospodnetic and Adam Hiatt)    

17. SOLR-182: allow lazy loading of request handlers on first request.
    (Ryan McKinley via yonik)

18. SOLR-81: More SpellCheckerRequestHandler enhancements, inlcluding
    support for relative or absolute directory path configurations, as
    well as RAM based directory. (hossman)   

19. SOLR-197: New parameters for input: stream.contentType for specifying
    or overriding the content type of input, and stream.file for reading
    local files. (Ryan McKinley via yonik)

20. SOLR-66: CSV data format for document additions and updates. (yonik)

21. SOLR-184: add echoHandler=true to responseHeader, support echoParams=all
    (Ryan McKinley via ehatcher)
    
22. SOLR-211: Added a regex PatternTokenizerFactory.  This extracts tokens 
    from the input string using a regex Pattern. (Ryan McKinley)
    
23. SOLR-162: Added a "Luke" request handler and other admin helpers.
    This exposes the system status through the standard requestHandler
    framework. (ryan)
    
24. SOLR-212: Added a DirectSolrConnection class.  This lets you access
    solr using the standard request/response formats, but does not require
    an HTTP connection.  It is designed for embedded applications. (ryan)    

25. SOLR-204: The request dispatcher (added in SOLR-104) can handle
    calls to /select.  This offers uniform error handling for /update and 
    /select.  To enable this behavior, you must add:
      <requestDispatcher handleSelect="true" > to your solrconfig.xml
    See the example solrconfig.xml for details.  (ryan)

26. SOLR-170: StandardRequestHandler now supports a "sort" parameter.
    Using the ';' syntax is still supported, but it is recommended to 
    transition to the new syntax. (ryan)

27. SOLR-181: The index schema now supports "required" fields.  Attempts
    to add a document without a required field will fail, returning a
    descriptive error message.  By default, the uniqueKey field is
    a required field.  This can be disabled by setting required=false
    in schema.xml.  (Greg Ludington via ryan)

28. SOLR-217: Fields configured in the schema to be neither indexed or
    stored will now be quietly ignored by Solr when Documents are added.
    The example schema has a comment explaining how this can be used to
    ignore any "unknown" fields.
    (Will Johnson via hossman)

29. SOLR-227: If schema.xml defines multiple fieldTypes, fields, or 
    dynamicFields with the same name, a severe error will be logged rather 
    then quietly continuing. Depending on the <abortOnConfigurationError> 
    settings, this may halt the server.  Likewise, if solrconfig.xml 
    defines multiple RequestHandlers with the same name it will also add
    an error.  (ryan)

30. SOLR-226: Added support for dynamic field as the destination of a 
    copyField using glob (*) replacement. (ryan)
    
31. SOLR-224: Adding a PhoneticFilterFactory that uses apache commons codec
    language encoders to build phonetically similar tokens.  This currently
    supports: DoubleMetaphone, Metaphone, Soundex, and RefinedSoundex (ryan)

32. SOLR-199: new n-gram tokenizers available via NGramTokenizerFactory 
    and EdgeNGramTokenizerFactory. (Adam Hiatt via yonik)

33. SOLR-234: TrimFilter can update the Token's startOffset and endOffset 
    if updateOffsets="true".  By default the Token offsets are unchanged.
    (ryan)
    
Changes in runtime behavior
 1. Highlighting using DisMax will only pick up terms from the main 
    user query, not boost or filter queries (klaas).

 2. SOLR-125: Change default of json.nl to flat, change so that
    json.nl only affects items where order matters (facet constraint
    listings).  Fix JSON output bug for null values.  Internal JAVA API:
    change most uses of NamedList to SimpleOrderedMap. (yonik)

 3. A new method "getSolrQueryParser" has been added to the IndexSchema
    class for retrieving a new SolrQueryParser instance with all options
    specified in the schema.xml's <solrQueryParser> block set.  The
    documentation for the SolrQueryParser constructor and it's use of
    IndexSchema have also been clarified.
    (Erik Hatcher and hossman)

 4. DisMaxRequestHandler's bq, bf, qf, and pf parameters can now accept
    multiple values (klaas).

 5. Query are re-written before highlighting is performed.  This enables
    proper highlighting of prefix and wildcard queries (klaas).

 6. A meaningful exception is raised when attempting to add a doc missing 
    a unique id if it is declared in the schema and allowDups=false.
    (ryan via klaas)

 7. SOLR-183: Exceptions with error code 400 are raised when
    numeric argument parsing fails.  RequiredSolrParams class added
    to facilitate checking for parameters that must be present.
    (Ryan McKinley, J.J. Larrea via yonik)

 8. SOLR-179: By default, solr will abort after any severe initalization
    errors.  This behavior can be disabled by setting:
    <abortOnConfigurationError>false</abortOnConfigurationError>
    in solrconfig.xml (ryan)

 9. The example solrconfig.xml maps /update to XmlUpdateRequestHandler using 
    the new request dispatcher (SOLR-104).  This requires posted content to 
    have a valid contentType: curl -H 'Content-type:text/xml; charset=utf-8' 
    The response format matches that of /select and returns standard error 
    codes.  To enable solr1.1 style /update, do not map "/update" to any 
    handler in solrconfig.xml (ryan)

10. SOLR-231: If a charset is not specified in the contentType, 
    ContentStream.getReader() will use UTF-8 encoding.  (ryan)

11. SOLR-230: More options for post.jar to support stdin, xml on the
    commandline, and defering commits.  Tutorial modified to take
    advantage of these options so there is no need for curl.
    (hossman)

12. SOLR-128: Upgraded Jetty to the latest stable release 6.1.3 (ryan)
    
Optimizations 
 1. SOLR-114: HashDocSet specific implementations of union() and andNot()
    for a 20x performance improvement for those set operations, and a new
    hash algorithm speeds up exists() by 10% and intersectionSize() by 8%.
    (yonik)
   
 2. SOLR-115: Solr now uses BooleanQuery.clauses() instead of
    BooleanQuery.getClauses() in any situation where there is no risk of
    modifying the original query.
    (hossman)

 3. SOLR-221: Speed up sorted faceting on multivalued fields by ~60%
    when the base set consists of a relatively large portion of the
    index. (yonik)

 4. SOLR-221: Added a facet.enum.cache.minDf parameter which avoids
    using the filterCache for terms that match few documents, trading
    decreased memory usage for increased query time. (yonik)

Bug Fixes
 1. SOLR-87: Parsing of synonym files did not correctly handle escaped
    whitespace such as \r\n\t\b\f. (yonik)

 2. SOLR-92: DOMUtils.getText (used when parsing config files) did not 
    work properly with many DOM implementations when dealing with 
    "Attributes". (Ryan McKinley via hossman)

 3. SOLR-9,SOLR-99: Tighten up sort specification error checking, throw
    exceptions for missing sort specifications or a sort on a non-indexed
    field. (Ryan McKinley via yonik)
    
 4. SOLR-145: Fix for bug introduced in SOLR-104 where some Exceptions
    were being ignored by all "out of the box" RequestHandlers. (hossman)
      
 5. SOLR-166: JNDI solr.home code refactoring.  SOLR-104 moved
    some JNDI related code to the init method of a Servlet Filter -
    according to the Servlet Spec, all Filter's should be initialized
    prior to initializing any Servlets, but this is not the case in at
    least one Servlet Container (Resin).  This "bug fix" refactors
    this JNDI code so that it should be executed the first time any
    attempt is made to use the solr.home dir.
    (Ryan McKinley via hossman)

 6. SOLR-173: Bug fix to SolrDispatchFilter to reduce "too many open
    files" problem was that SolrDispatchFilter was not closing requests
    when finished.  Also modified ResponseWriters to only fetch a Searcher
    reference if necessary for writing out DocLists.
    (Ryan McKinley via hossman)

 7. SOLR-168: Fix display positioning of multiple tokens at the same
    position in analysis.jsp (yonik)

 8. SOLR-167: The SynonymFilter sometimes generated incorrect offsets when
    multi token synonyms were mached in the source text. (yonik) 

 9. SOLR-188: bin scripts do not support non-default webapp names.  Added "-U"
    option to specify a full path to the update url, overriding the
    "-h" (hostname), "-p" (port) and "-w" (webapp name) parameters.
    (Jeff Rodenburg via billa)

10. SOLR-198: RunExecutableListener always waited for the process to
    finish, even when wait="false" was set. (Koji Sekiguchi via yonik)

11. SOLR-207: Changed distribution scripts to remove recursive find
    and avoid use of "find -maxdepth" on platforms where it is not
    supported. (yonik)

12. SOLR-222: Changing writeLockTimeout in solrconfig.xml did not
    change the effective timeout. (Koji Sekiguchi via yonik)

13. Changed the SOLR-104 RequestDispatcher so that /select?qt=xxx can not 
    access handlers that start with "/".  This makes path based authentication
    possible for path based request handlers.  (ryan)

14. SOLR-214: Some servlet containers (including Tomcat and Resin) do not
    obey the specified charset.  Rather then letting the the container handle 
    it solr now uses the charset from the header contentType to decode posted
    content.  Using the contentType: "text/xml; charset=utf-8" will force
    utf-8 encoding.  If you do not specify a contentType, it will use the 
    platform default.  (Koji Sekiguchi via ryan)

15. SOLR-241: Undefined system properties used in configuration files now
    cause a clear message to be logged rather than an obscure exception thrown.
    (Koji Sekiguchi via ehatcher) 

Other Changes
 1. Updated to Lucene 2.1

 2. Updated to Lucene 2007-05-20_00-04-53

================== Release 1.1.0, 20061222 ==================

Status
------
This is the first release since Solr joined the Incubator, and brings many
new features and performance optimizations including highlighting,
faceted browsing, and JSON/Python/Ruby response formats.


Upgrading from previous Solr versions
-------------------------------------
Older Apache Solr installations can be upgraded by replacing
the relevant war file with the new version.  No changes to configuration
files are needed and the index format has not changed.

The default version of the Solr XML response syntax has been changed to 2.2.
Behavior can be preserved for those clients not explicitly specifying a 
version by adding a default to the request handler in solrconfig.xml

By default, Solr will no longer use a searcher that has not fully warmed,
and requests will block in the meantime.  To change back to the previous
behavior of using a cold searcher in the event there is no other
warm searcher, see the useColdSearcher config item in solrconfig.xml

The XML response format when adding multiple documents to the collection
in a single <add> command has changed to return a single <result>.


Detailed Change List
--------------------

New Features
 1. added support for setting Lucene's positionIncrementGap
 2. Admin: new statistics for SolrIndexSearcher
 3. Admin: caches now show config params on stats page
 3. max() function added to FunctionQuery suite
 4. postOptimize hook, mirroring the functionallity of the postCommit hook,
    but only called on an index optimize.
 5. Ability to HTTP POST query requests to /select in addition to HTTP-GET
 6. The default search field may now be overridden by requests to the
    standard request handler using the df query parameter. (Erik Hatcher)
 7. Added DisMaxRequestHandler and SolrPluginUtils. (Chris Hostetter)
 8. Support for customizing the QueryResponseWriter per request
    (Mike Baranczak / SOLR-16 / hossman)
 9. Added KeywordTokenizerFactory (hossman)
10. copyField accepts dynamicfield-like names as the source.
    (Darren Erik Vengroff via yonik, SOLR-21)
11. new DocSet.andNot(), DocSet.andNotSize() (yonik)
12. Ability to store term vectors for fields. (Mike Klaas via yonik, SOLR-23)
13. New abstract BufferedTokenStream for people who want to write
    Tokenizers or TokenFilters that require arbitrary buffering of the
    stream. (SOLR-11 / yonik, hossman)
14. New RemoveDuplicatesToken - useful in situations where
    synonyms, stemming, or word-deliminater-ing produce identical tokens at
    the same position. (SOLR-11 / yonik, hossman)
15. Added highlighting to SolrPluginUtils and implemented in StandardRequestHandler
    and DisMaxRequestHandler (SOLR-24 / Mike Klaas via hossman,yonik)
16. SnowballPorterFilterFactory language is configurable via the "language"
    attribute, with the default being "English".  (Bertrand Delacretaz via yonik, SOLR-27)
17. ISOLatin1AccentFilterFactory, instantiates ISOLatin1AccentFilter to remove accents.
    (Bertrand Delacretaz via yonik, SOLR-28)
18. JSON, Python, Ruby QueryResponseWriters: use wt="json", "python" or "ruby"
    (yonik, SOLR-31)
19. Make web admin pages return UTF-8, change Content-type declaration to include a
    space between the mime-type and charset (Philip Jacob, SOLR-35)
20. Made query parser default operator configurable via schema.xml:
         <solrQueryParser defaultOperator="AND|OR"/>
    The default operator remains "OR".
21. JAVA API: new version of SolrIndexSearcher.getDocListAndSet() which takes
    flags (Greg Ludington via yonik, SOLR-39)
22. A HyphenatedWordsFilter, a text analysis filter used during indexing to rejoin
    words that were hyphenated and split by a newline. (Boris Vitez via yonik, SOLR-41)
23. Added a CompressableField base class which allows fields of derived types to
    be compressed using the compress=true setting.  The field type also gains the
    ability to specify a size threshold at which field data is compressed.
    (klaas, SOLR-45)
24. Simple faceted search support for fields (enumerating terms)
    and arbitrary queries added to both StandardRequestHandler and
    DisMaxRequestHandler. (hossman, SOLR-44)
25. In addition to specifying default RequestHandler params in the
    solrconfig.xml, support has been added for configuring values to be
    appended to the multi-val request params, as well as for configuring
    invariant params that can not overridden in the query. (hossman, SOLR-46)
26. Default operator for query parsing can now be specified with q.op=AND|OR
    from the client request, overriding the schema value. (ehatcher)
27. New XSLTResponseWriter does server side XSLT processing of XML Response.
    In the process, an init(NamedList) method was added to QueryResponseWriter
    which works the same way as SolrRequestHandler.
    (Bertrand Delacretaz / SOLR-49 / hossman)
28. json.wrf parameter adds a wrapper-function around the JSON response,
    useful in AJAX with dynamic script tags for specifying a JavaScript
    callback function. (Bertrand Delacretaz via yonik, SOLR-56)
29. autoCommit can be specified every so many documents added (klaas, SOLR-65)
30. ${solr.home}/lib directory can now be used for specifying "plugin" jars
    (hossman, SOLR-68)
31. Support for "Date Math" relative "NOW" when specifying values of a
    DateField in a query -- or when adding a document.
    (hossman, SOLR-71)
32. useColdSearcher control in solrconfig.xml prevents the first searcher
    from being used before it's done warming.  This can help prevent
    thrashing on startup when multiple requests hit a cold searcher.
    The default is "false", preventing use before warm. (yonik, SOLR-77)
    
Changes in runtime behavior
 1. classes reorganized into different packages, package names changed to Apache
 2. force read of document stored fields in QuerySenderListener
 3. Solr now looks in ./solr/conf for config, ./solr/data for data
    configurable via solr.solr.home system property
 4. Highlighter params changed to be prefixed with "hl."; allow fragmentsize
    customization and per-field overrides on many options 
    (Andrew May via klaas, SOLR-37)
 5. Default param values for DisMaxRequestHandler should now be specified
    using a '<lst name="defaults">...</lst>' init param, for backwards
    compatability all init prams will be used as defaults if an init param
    with that name does not exist. (hossman, SOLR-43)
 6. The DisMaxRequestHandler now supports multiple occurances of the "fq"
    param. (hossman, SOLR-44)
 7. FunctionQuery.explain now uses ComplexExplanation to provide more
    accurate score explanations when composed in a BooleanQuery.
    (hossman, SOLR-25)
 8. Document update handling locking is much sparser, allowing performance gains
    through multiple threads.  Large commits also might be faster (klaas, SOLR-65)
 9. Lazy field loading can be enabled via a solrconfig directive.  This will be faster when
    not all stored fields are needed from a document (klaas, SOLR-52)   
10. Made admin JSPs return XML and transform them with new XSL stylesheets
    (Otis Gospodnetic, SOLR-58)
11. If the "echoParams=explicit" request parameter is set, request parameters are copied 
    to the output. In an XML output, they appear in new <lst name="params"> list inside 
    the new <lst name="responseHeader"> element, which replaces the old <responseHeader>. 
    Adding a version=2.1 parameter to the request produces the old format, for backwards 
    compatibility (bdelacretaz and yonik, SOLR-59).

Optimizations 
 1. getDocListAndSet can now generate both a DocList and a DocSet from a 
    single lucene query.
 2. BitDocSet.intersectionSize(HashDocSet) no longer generates an intermediate
    set
 3. OpenBitSet completed, replaces BitSet as the implementation for BitDocSet.
    Iteration is faster, and BitDocSet.intersectionSize(BitDocSet) and unionSize
    is between 3 and 4 times faster. (yonik, SOLR-15)
 4. much faster unionSize when one of the sets is a HashDocSet: O(smaller_set_size)
 5. Optimized getDocSet() for term queries resulting in a 36% speedup of facet.field
    queries where DocSets aren't cached (for example, if the number of terms in the field
    is larger than the filter cache.) (yonik)
 6. Optimized facet.field faceting by as much as 500 times when the field has
    a single token per document (not multiValued & not tokenized) by using the
    Lucene FieldCache entry for that field to tally term counts.  The first request
    utilizing the FieldCache will take longer than subsequent ones.

Bug Fixes
 1. Fixed delete-by-id for field types who's indexed form is different
    from the printable form (mainly sortable numeric types).
 2. Added escaping of attribute values in the XML response (Erik Hatcher)
 3. Added empty extractTerms() to FunctionQuery to enable use in
    a MultiSearcher (Yonik)
 4. WordDelimiterFilter sometimes lost token positionIncrement information
 5. Fix reverse sorting for fields were sortMissingFirst=true
    (Rob Staveley, yonik)
 6. Worked around a Jetty bug that caused invalid XML responses for fields
    containing non ASCII chars.  (Bertrand Delacretaz via yonik, SOLR-32)
 7. WordDelimiterFilter can throw exceptions if configured with both
    generate and catenate off.  (Mike Klaas via yonik, SOLR-34)
 8. Escape '>' in XML output (because ]]> is illegal in CharData) 
 9. field boosts weren't being applied and doc boosts were being applied to fields (klaas)
10. Multiple-doc update generates well-formed xml (klaas, SOLR-65)
11. Better parsing of pingQuery from solrconfig.xml (hossman, SOLR-70)
12. Fixed bug with "Distribution" page introduced when Versions were
    added to "Info" page (hossman)
13. Fixed HTML escaping issues with user input to analysis.jsp and action.jsp
    (hossman, SOLR-74)
