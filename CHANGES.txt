1.3 DEV1

 1. Fixed PriorityQueue's clear() method.
    Fix for bug 9454, http://nagoya.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=9454
    (Matthijs Bomhoff via otis)

 2. Changed StandardTokenizer.jj grammar for EMAIL tokens.
    Fix for bug 9015, http://nagoya.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=9015
    (Dale Anson via otis)

1.2 RC6

 1. Changed QueryParser.jj to have "?" be a special character which
    allowed it to be used as a wildcard term. Updated TestWildcard 
    unit test also. (Ralf Hettesheimer via carlson)

1.2 RC5

 1. Renamed build.properties to default.properties and updated
    the BUILD.txt document to describe how to override the
    default.property settings without having to edit the file. This
    brings the build process closer to Scarab's build process.
    (jon)

 2. Added MultiFieldQueryParser class. (Kelvin Tan, via otis)

 3. Updated "powered by" links. (otis)

 4. Fixed instruction for setting up JavaCC - Bug #7017 (otis)

 5. Added throwing exception if FSDirectory could not create diectory 
    - Bug #6914 (Eugene Gluzberg via otis)

 6. Update MultiSearcher, MultiFieldParse, Constants, DateFilter, 
    LowerCaseTokenizer javadoc (otis)

 7. Added fix to avoid NullPointerException in results.jsp
    (Mark Hayes via otis)

 8. Changed Wildcard search to find 0 or more char instead of 1 or more
    (Lee Mallobone, via otis)

 9. Fixed error in offset issue in GermanStemFilter - Bug #7412
    (Rodrigo Reyes, via otis)

 10. Added unit tests for wildcard search and DateFilter (otis)

 11. Allow co-existence of indexed and non-indexed fields with the same name
     (cutting/casper, via otis)

 12. Add escape character to query parser.  
     (briangoetz)

 13. Applied a patch that ensures that searches that use DateFilter
     don't throw an exception when no matches are found. (David Smiley, via
     otis)
 
 14. Fixed bugs in DateFilter and wildcardquery unit tests. (cutting, otis, carlson)
 
 
1.2 RC4

 1. Updated contributions section of website.
    Add XML Document #3 implementation to Document Section.
    Also added Term Highlighting to Misc Section. (carlson)

 2. Fixed NullPointerException for phrase searches containing
    unindexed terms, introduced in 1.2RC3.  (cutting)

 3. Changed document deletion code to obtain the index write lock,
    enforcing the fact that document addition and deletion cannot be
    performed concurrently.  (cutting)

 4. Various documentation cleanups.  (otis, acoliver)

 5. Updated "powered by" links.  (cutting, jon)

 6. Fixed a bug in the GermanStemmer.  (Bernhard Messer, via otis)

 7. Changed Term and Query to implement Serializable.  (scottganyo)

 8. Fixed to never delete indexes added with IndexWriter.addIndexes().
    (cutting)

 9. Upgraded to JUnit 3.7. (otis)

1.2 RC3

 1. IndexWriter: fixed a bug where adding an optimized index to an
    empty index failed.  This was encountered using addIndexes to copy
    a RAMDirectory index to an FSDirectory.

 2. RAMDirectory: fixed a bug where RAMInputStream could not read
    across more than across a single buffer boundary.

 3. Fix query parser so it accepts queries with unicode characters.
    (briangoetz)

 4. Fix query parser so that PrefixQuery is used in preference to
    WildcardQuery when there's only an asterisk at the end of the
    term.  Previously PrefixQuery would never be used.

 5. Fix tests so they compile; fix ant file so it compiles tests
    properly.  Added test cases for Analyzers and PriorityQueue.

 6. Updated demos, added Getting Started documentation. (acoliver)

 7. Added 'contributions' section to website & docs. (carlson)

 8. Removed JavaCC from source distribution for copyright reasons.
    Folks must now download this separately from metamata in order to
    compile Lucene.  (cutting)

 9. Substantially improved the performance of DateFilter by adding the
    ability to reuse TermDocs objects.  (cutting)

10. Added IndexReader methods:
      public static boolean indexExists(String directory);
      public static boolean indexExists(File directory);
      public static boolean indexExists(Directory directory);
      public static boolean isLocked(Directory directory);
      public static void unlock(Directory directory);
    (cutting, otis)

11. Fixed bugs in GermanAnalyzer (gschwarz)


1.2 RC2, 19 October 2001:
 - added sources to distribution
 - removed broken build scripts and libraries from distribution
 - SegmentsReader: fixed potential race condition
 - FSDirectory: fixed so that getDirectory(xxx,true) correctly
   erases the directory contents, even when the directory
   has already been accessed in this JVM.
 - RangeQuery: Fix issue where an inclusive range query would
   include the nearest term in the index above a non-existant
   specified upper term.
 - SegmentTermEnum: Fix NullPointerException in clone() method
   when the Term is null.
 - JDK 1.1 compatibility fix: disabled lock files for JDK 1.1,
   since they rely on a feature added in JDK 1.2.

1.2 RC1 (first Apache release), 2 October 2001:
  - packages renamed from com.lucene to org.apache.lucene
  - license switched from LGPL to Apache
  - ant-only build -- no more makefiles
  - addition of lock files--now fully thread & process safe
  - addition of German stemmer
  - MultiSearcher now supports low-level search API
  - added RangeQuery, for term-range searching
  - Analyzers can choose tokenizer based on field name
  - misc bug fixes.

1.01b (last Sourceforge release), 2 July 2001
 . a few bug fixes
 . new Query Parser
 . new prefix query (search for "foo*" matches "food")

1.0, 2000-10-04

This release fixes a few serious bugs and also includes some
performance optimizations, a stemmer, and a few other minor
enhancements.

0.04 2000-04-19

Lucene now includes a grammar-based tokenizer, StandardTokenizer.

The only tokenizer included in the previous release (LetterTokenizer)
identified terms consisting entirely of alphabetic characters.  The
new tokenizer uses a regular-expression grammar to identify more
complex classes of terms, including numbers, acronyms, email
addresses, etc.

StandardTokenizer serves two purposes:

 1. It is a much better, general purpose tokenizer for use by
    applications as is.

    The easiest way for applications to start using
    StandardTokenizer is to use StandardAnalyzer.

 2. It provides a good example of grammar-based tokenization.

    If an application has special tokenization requirements, it can
    implement a custom tokenizer by copying the directory containing
    the new tokenizer into the application and modifying it
    accordingly.

0.01, 2000-03-30

First open source release.

The code has been re-organized into a new package and directory
structure for this release.  It builds OK, but has not been tested
beyond that since the re-organization.
