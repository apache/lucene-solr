Lucene Build Instructions

$Id$

Basic steps:
  0) Install JDK 1.2 (or greater), Ant 1.4 (or greater), and the Ant
     optional.jar
  1) Download Lucene from Apache and unpack it
  2) Connect to the top-level of your Lucene installation
  3) Install JavaCC
  4) Run ant

Step 0) Set up your development environment (JDK 1.2 or greater,
Ant 1.4 or greater)

We'll assume that you know how to get and set up the JDK - if you
don't, then we suggest starting at http://java.sun.com and learning
more about Java, before returning to this README.

Lucene runs with JDK 1.2 and later.  However, if you're going to work
with the development version of Lucene, we recommend you stick with
the most current version of Java (at the time of this writing, JDK
1.4).  Also, note that if you're working with the Lucene source,
you'll need to use Ant (see below) and Ant requires at least JDK 1.1
(and in the future will likely move to requiring JDK 1.2, according to
the Ant install docs).

Like most of the Jakarta projects, Lucene uses Apache Ant for build
control.  Specifically, you MUST use Ant version 1.4 or greater.

Ant is "kind of like make without make's wrinkles".  Ant is
implemented in java and uses XML-based configuration files.  You can
get it at:

  http://jakarta.apache.org/ant

Specifically, you can get the binary distributions at:

  http://jakarta.apache.org/builds/jakarta-ant/release/

You'll need to download both the Ant binary distribution and the
"optional" jar file.  Install these according to the instructions at:

  http://jakarta.apache.org/ant/manual

Step 1) Download Lucene from Apache

We'll assume you already did this, or you wouldn't be reading this
file.  However, you might have received this file by some alternate
route, or you might have an incomplete copy of the Lucene, so: Lucene
releases are available for download at:

  http://jakarta.apache.org/builds/jakarta-lucene/release/

Download either a zip or a tarred/gzipped version of the archive, and
uncompress it into a directory of your choice.

Step 2) Connect to the top-level of your Lucene installation

Lucene's top-level directory contains the default.properties and
build.xml files. By default, you do not need to change any of the
settings in these files, but you do need to run ant from this location
so it knows where to find them.

If you would like to change the settings in the default.properties there
is no need to edit the default.properties file, you can override the
property settings by creating one or more of the following files and
placing your own property settings in there:

    ~/lucene.build.properties
    ~/build.properties
    jakarta-lucene/build.properties

The first property which is found in the order with which the files are
loaded becomes the property setting which is used by the Ant build
system.

NOTE: the ~ character represents your user account home directory.

Step 3) Install JavaCC

Building the Lucene distribution from the source requires the JavaCC
parser generator.  This software has a separate license agreement that
must be agreed to before you can use it.  The web page for JavaCC is here:

  http://www.experimentalstuff.com/Technologies/JavaCC/

Follow the download links and download the zip file to a temporary
location on your file system. Unzip the file and run the large class file
in the directory. On windows, use this command from the temp directory:

  java -cp . JavaCC2_1

This will launch a Java GUI installer.  There is also a command line
installer available, and the installation class will give you those
directions.  After JavaCC is installed, edit your build properties
(as in step 2), and add the line

  javacc.home=/javacc/bin

where this points to the bin directory of your javacc installation.

Step 4) Run ant

Assuming you have ant in your PATH and have set ANT_HOME to the
location of your ant installation, typing "ant" at the shell prompt
and command prompt should run ant.  Ant will by default look for the
"build.xml" file in your current directory, and compile Lucene.
