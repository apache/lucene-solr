Bugs:
	- some relative URLs are not appended appropriately, leading to wrong and growing URLs
	  - 301/302 URLs were not updated: the docs were saved under the old URL, which lead to
	    wrong relative URLs (cmarschner, 2002-06-17)
    - fixed build.xml
    
URLs: 
	- include a URLNormalizer
	  * lowercase host names
	  * avoid ambiguities like '%20' / '+'
	  * make sure http://host URLs end with "/"
	  * avoid host name aliases
	    - two host names / one ip adress can point to the same web site: www.lmu.de / www.uni-muenchen.de
	    - two host names / one ip adress can point to different web sites (then other URLs / pages must differ)
	      suche.lmu.de / interesse.lmu.de
	  * cater 301/302 result codes
	STATUS: seems to be solved except that URL parameters can occur in different orders, which is NOT resolved
		host names are resolved by hand, via a synonym in HostManager. (cmarschner, 2002-06-17)
		problem: URLMessage size doubles

* Bugs
	- on very fast LAN connections (100MBit), sockets are not freed as fast as allocated
	  probably this will be solved by changing from HTTPClient.* to Jakarta HTTP client and reuse sockets



* LuceneStorage
	- define a configurable interface that saves fetched pages into a Lucene index

* Configuration
	- move all configuration stuff into a meaningful properties file


* Repository
	- optionally use a database as repository (caches, queues, logs)
	- if done so, use URL reordering to speed things up

* Tests
	  - Put all tests into a JUnit test suite

* distribution
	- optionally send messages through a JMS topic. 
	- create an executable that installs a source (like JMS, page files) and a storage pipeline
	- partition the URL space for distributed Fetchers

* Speed
	- avoid synchronization delays by putting several URLMessages into one FetcherTask

* Services
	- clean up ThreadMonitor
	- incorporate a CRON-like service that enables timed GC'ing, batched data transfer, and
	  monitoring

* Politeness
	- add the option to restrict the number of host accesses per hour/minute

* URL Extraction
	- URLs can be encoded in different encoding styles - see http://www.unicode.org/unicode/faq/unicode_web.html

* I18N, HTML encoding
	- determine document encoding style in content-type, meta tag (http-equiv), or Doctype-tag; adapt URLs to
	  encoding style

* Anchor text extraction
	  * read until a meaningful end tag, not just the first encountered
	  * remove entities
	  * optionally remove Tags, leave ALT attribute
	  * remove redundant spaces

* URLNormalizer
	* add possibility to add synonyms to top level domains, i.e. "d1.com = d2.com" --> "sub1.d1.com = sub1.d2.com"
	* add possibility to detect synonyms automatically, i.e. by comparing IP addresses or file checksums

Nice-to-have:

* Stop and Continue (probably with database repository)
* "Hot Configure" from outside
* Web Interface

Next topic:
* Incremental crawling
