     Apache Cocoon Documentation Book DTD (Version 1.0)

PURPOSE:
This DTD defines the */book.xml documentation configuration files.

TYPICAL INVOCATION:

  <!DOCTYPE book PUBLIC
       "-//APACHE//DTD Cocoon Documentation Book Vx.yz//EN"
       "http://xml.apache.org/DTD/book-cocoon-vxyz.dtd">

  where 
  
    x := major version
    y := minor version
    z := status identifier (optional)
      
NOTES:
We need to replace this DTD with the proper one.
We are only using this DTD to enable validation during "build docs"
because every XML instance must declare its ruleset.

This initial minimal DTD has been reverse-engineered from the structure
of the current documents, e.g. 
 docuemntation/xdocs/book.xml
  
AUTHORS:
  David Crossley <crossley@apache.org>
  
FIXME:
  - find the proper DTD for book.xml
