# Running this script should only be necessary if the keystore file
# needs to be replaced, which shouldn't be required until sometime around
# the year 4751.

# NOTE: the "-ext" option used in the "keytool" command requires that you have
# the java7 version of keytool, but the generated key will work with any 
# version of java
