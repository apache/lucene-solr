== Container plugins subsystem
Container plugins are pluggable components that are defined and instantiated at the
`CoreContainer` (node) level. The components usually provide an admin-level API for
additional functionality at the Solr node level.

=== Plugin configurations
Plugin configurations are maintained in ZooKeeper in the `/clusterprops.json` file, under
the `plugin` entry. The configuration is a JSON map where keys are the plugin names, and
values are serialized `org.apache.solr.client.solrj.request.beans.PluginMeta` beans.

== Types of container plugins

=== Plugin life-cycle
Plugin instances are loaded and initialized when Solr's `CoreContainer` is first created.

Then on each update of the plugin configurations the existing plugin configs are compared
with the new configs, and plugin instances are respectively created, removed, or
replaced (i.e. removed and added using the new configuration).

If a plugin implementation class has a constructor that accepts an instance of
`CoreContainer` then it is instantiated using this constructor, and the current instance
of `CoreContainer` is passed as argument.

=== PluginRegistryListener
Components that need to be aware of changes in plugin configurations or registration can
implement `org.apache.solr.api.ContainerPluginsRegistry.PluginRegistryListener` and register
it with the instance of registry available from `coreContainer.getContainerPluginsRegistry()`.

=== ClusterSingleton plugins
Plugins that implement `ClusterSingleton` interface are instantiated on each
Solr node. However, their start/stop life-cycle, as defined in the interface,
is controlled in such a way that only a single running instance of the plugin
is present in the cluster at any time.

(Currently this is implemented by re-using the Overseer leader election, so all
`ClusterSingleton`-s that are in the RUNNING state execute on the Overseer leader).

Any plugin type can implement this interface to indicate to Solr that
it requires this cluster singleton behavior.

// explain plugins that register Api-s
// explain plugins that don't implement any Api
=== ClusterEventProducer plugin
In order to support the generation of cluster-level events an implementation of
`ClusterEventProducer` is created on each Solr node. This component is also a
`ClusterSingleton`, which means that only one active instance is present in the
cluster at any time.

If no plugin configuration is specified then the default implementation
`org.apache.solr.cluster.events.impl.DefaultClusterEventProducer` is used. A no-op
implementation is also available in `org.apache.solr.cluster.events.NoOpProducer`.

=== ClusterEventListener plugins
Plugins that implement the `ClusterEventListener` interface will be automatically
registered with the instance of `ClusterEventProducer`.

== Plugin management API

== Predefined plugin names

Plugins with these names are used in specific parts of Solr. Their names are reserved
and cannot be used for other plugin types:

// XXX uncomment when we move the config to plugins
//`placement-plugin`::
//plugin that implements `PlacementPlugin` interface. This type of plugin
//determines the replica placement strategy in the cluster.

`cluster-event-producer`::
plugin that implements `ClusterEventProducer` interface. This type of plugin
is used for generating cluster-level events.
