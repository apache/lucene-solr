== Node added / lost markers
Since triggers execute on the node that runs Overseer, should this node go down the `nodeLost`
event would be lost because there would be no mechanism to generate it. Similarly, if a node has
been added between the Overseer leader change was completed the `nodeAdded` event would not be
generated.

For this reason Solr implements additional mechanisms to ensure that these events are generated
reliably.

When a node joins a cluster its presence is marked as an ephemeral ZK path in the `/live_nodes/<nodeName>`
ZooKeeper directory, but now also an ephemeral path is created under `/autoscaling/nodeAdded/<nodeName>`.
When a new instance of Overseer leader is started it will run the `nodeAdded` trigger (if it's configured)
and discover the presence of this ZK path, at which point it will remove it and generate a `nodeAdded` event.

When a node leaves the cluster up to three remaining nodes will try to create a persistent ZK path
`/autoscaling/nodeLost/<nodeName>` and eventually one of them succeeds. When a new instance of Overseer leader
is started it will run the `nodeLost` trigger (if it's configured) and discover the presence of this ZK
path, at which point it will remove it and generate a `nodeLost` event.

== Trigger state checkpointing
Triggers generate events based on their internal state. If Overseer leader goes down while the trigger is
about to generate a new event, it's likely that the event would be lost because a new trigger instance
running on the new Overseer leader would start from a clean slate.

For this reason after each time a trigger is executed its internal state is persisted to ZooKeeper, and
on Overseer start its internal state is restored.

== Trigger event queues
Autoscaling framework limits the rate at which events are processed using several different mechanisms.
One is the locking mechanism that prevents concurrent
processing of events, and another is a single-threaded executor that runs trigger actions.

This means that the processing of an event may take significant time, and during this time it's possible that
Overseer may go down. In order to avoid losing events that were already generated but not yet fully
processed events are queued before processing is started.

Separate ZooKeeper queues are created for each trigger, and events produced by triggers are put on these
per-trigger queues. When a new Overseer leader is started it will first check
these queues and process events accumulated there, and only then it will continue to run triggers
normally. Queued events that fail processing during this "replay" stage are discarded.
