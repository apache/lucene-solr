The Lucene/Solr project has made it easy for anyone to contribute to the Solr Reference Guide with a patch.

The Guide is written in simple AsciiDoc-formatted files, and the source lives in the main Lucene/Solr source repository, right alongside the code.

// This section only appears in the PDF version of the Ref Guide.

Find information on how to contribute to documentation online at https://lucene.apache.org/solr/guide/how-to-contribute.html.

// This section only appears in the HTML version of the Ref Guide.
ifdef::backend-html5[]
The following sections give an overview of how to work with AsciiDoc-format files, how our documentation is generated, and how to do a Ref Guide release.

Once you have a patch you'd like to contribute, you can submit it with a JIRA issue, the same as any other patch. See also the Solr wiki section on https://wiki.apache.org/solr/HowToContribute[How To Contribute] for information on submitting patches.
