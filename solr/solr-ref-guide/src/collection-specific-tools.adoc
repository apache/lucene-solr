In the left-hand navigation bar, you will see a pull-down menu titled "Collection Selector" that can be used to access collection specific administration screens.

.Only Visible When Using SolrCloud
[NOTE]
====
The "Collection Selector" pull-down menu is only available on Solr instances running in <<solrcloud.adoc#solrcloud,SolrCloud mode>>.

Single node or master/slave replication instances of Solr will not display this menu, instead the Collection specific UI pages described in this section will be available in the <<core-specific-tools.adoc#core-specific-tools,Core Selector pull-down menu>>.
====

Clicking on the Collection Selector pull-down menu will show a list of the collections in your Solr cluster, with a search box that can be used to find a specific collection by name. When you select a collection from the pull-down, the main display of the page will display some basic metadata about the collection, and a secondary menu will appear in the left nav with links to additional collection specific administration screens.
