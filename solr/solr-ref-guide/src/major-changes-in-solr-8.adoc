* Due to LIR redesign in SOLR-11702, all users must be on Solr 7.3 or higher to upgrade to Solr 8

* SOLR-13025: BM25 scoring formula changes will lead to lower absolute scores. This is controlled by luceneMatchVersion,
  so that existing scoring is kept as is when using BM25SimilarityFactory (the default) for 6.x and 7.x luceneMatchVersions
  while for 8.0.0 and later the new formula will be used. There is also a new LegacyBM25SimilarityFactory that may
  be used to force the old formula even for luceneMatchVersion>=8.x. See also explanation in Reference Guide.
