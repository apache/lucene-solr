* Due to LIR redesign in SOLR-11702, all users must be on Solr 7.3 or higher to upgrade to Solr 8

* If you explicitly use BM25SimilarityFactory in your schema the absolute scoring will be lower, see SOLR-13025.
  But ordering of documents will not change in the normal case. Use LegacyBM25SimilarityFactory if you need to force
  the old 6.x/7.x scoring. Note that if you have not specified any similarity in schema or use the default 
  SchemaSimilarityFactory, then LegacyBM25Similarity is automatically selected for 'luceneMatchVersion' < 8.0.0.
  See also explanation in Reference Guide chapter "Other Schema Elements".
