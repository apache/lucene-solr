== Solr 9 Upgrade Planning

Before starting an upgrade to Solr 9, please take the time to review all information about changes from the version you are currently on up to Solr 9.

You should also consider all changes that have been made to Solr in any version you have not upgraded to already. For example, if you are currently using Solr 8.1, you should review changes made in all subsequent 8.x releases in addition to changes for 9.0.

A thorough review of the list in Major Changes in Earlier 8.x Versions as well as the {solr-javadocs}/changes/Changes.html[CHANGES.txt] in your Solr instance will help you plan your migration to Solr 9.
