Monte Carlo simulations are commonly used to model the behavior of
stochastic systems. This section of the user guide describes
how to perform both *uncorrelated* and *correlated* Monte Carlo simulations
using the *sampling* capabilities of the probability distribution framework.

=== Uncorrelated Simulations

Uncorrelated Monte Carlo simulations model stochastic systems with the assumption
 that the underlying random variables move independently of each other.
 A simple example of a Monte Carlo simulation using two independently changing random variables
 is described below.

In this example a Monte Carlo simulation is used to determine the probability that a simple hinge assembly will
fall within a required length specification.

The hinge has two components *A* and *B*. The combined length of the two components must be less then 5 centimeters
to fall within specification.

A random sampling of lengths for component *A* has shown that its length conforms to a
normal distribution with a mean of 2.2 centimeters and a standard deviation of .0195
centimeters.

A random sampling of lengths for component *B* has shown that its length conforms
to a normal distribution with a mean of 2.71 centimeters and a standard deviation of .0198 centimeters.

The Monte Carlo simulation below performs the following steps:

* A normal distribution with a mean of 2.2 and a standard deviation of .0195 is created to model the length of componentA.
* A normal distribution with a mean of 2.71 and a standard deviation of .0198 is created to model the length of componentB.
* The `monteCarlo` function is used to simulate component pairs. The `monteCarlo` function
  calls the *add(sample(componentA), sample(componentB))* function 100000 times and collects the results in an array. Each
  time the function is called a random sample is drawn from the componentA
  and componentB length distributions. The `add` function adds the two samples to calculate the combined length.
  The result of each function run is collected in an array and assigned to the *simresults* variable.
* An `empiricalDistribution` function is then created from the *simresults* array to model the distribution of the
  simulation results.
* Finally, the `cumulativeProbability` function is called on the *simmodel* to determine the cumulative probability
  that the combined length of the components is 5 or less.
* Based on the simulation there is .9994371944629039 probability that the combined length of a component pair will
be 5 or less.

=== Correlated Simulations

The simulation above assumes that the lengths of *componentA* and *componentB* vary independently.
What would happen to the probability model if there was a correlation between the lengths of
*componentA* and *componentB*.

In the example below a database containing assembled pairs of components is used to determine
if there is a correlation between the lengths of the components, and how the correlation effects the model.

Before performing a simulation of the effects of correlation on the probability model its
useful to understand what the correlation is between the lengths of *componentA* and *componentB*.

In the example below 5000 random samples are selected from a collection
of assembled hinges. Each sample contains
lengths of the components in the fields *componentA_d* and *componentB_d*.

Both fields are then vectorized. The *componentA_d* vector is stored in
variable *b* and the *componentB_d* variable is stored in variable *c*.

Then the correlation of the two vectors is calculated using the `corr` function. Note that the outcome
from `corr` is 0.9996931313216989. This means that *componentA_d* and *componentB_d* are almost
perfectly correlated.

How does correlation effect the probability model?

The example below explores how to use a *multivariate normal distribution* function
to model how correlation effects the probability of hinge defects.

In this example 5000 random samples are selected from a collection
containing length data for assembled hinges. Each sample contains
the fields *componentA_d* and *componentB_d*.

Both fields are then vectorized. The *componentA_d* vector is stored in
variable *b* and the *componentB_d* variable is stored in variable *c*.

An array is created that contains the *means* of the two vectorized fields.

Then both vectors are added to a matrix which is transposed. This creates
an *observation* matrix where each row contains one observation of
*componentA_d* and *componentB_d*. A covariance matrix is then created from the columns of
the observation matrix with the
`cov` function. The covariance matrix describes the covariance between
*componentA_d* and *componentB_d*.

The `multivariateNormalDistribution` function is then called with the
array of means for the two fields and the covariance matrix. The model
for the multivariate normal distribution is stored in variable *g*.

The `monteCarlo` function then calls the function *add(sample(g))* 50000 times
and collections the results in a vector. Each time the function is called a single sample
is drawn from the multivariate normal distribution. Each sample is a vector containing
one *componentA* and *componentB* pair. the `add` function adds the values in the vector to
calculate the length of the pair. Over the long term the samples drawn from the
multivariate normal distribution will conform to the covariance matrix used to construct it.

Just as in the non-correlated example an empirical distribution is used to model probabilities
of the simulation vector and the `cumulativeProbability` function is used to compute the cumulative
probability that the combined component length will be 5 centimeters or less.

Notice that the probability of a hinge meeting specification has dropped to 0.9889517439980468.
This is because the strong correlation
between the lengths of components means that their lengths rise together causing more hinges to
fall out of the 5 centimeter specification.
