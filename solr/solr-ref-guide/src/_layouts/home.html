<!-- This layout is ONLY used for index.adoc, which is the default landing page for the Ref Guide.
     Its main difference is that it retains the h1 and class for page-title-main, but it does not have any content.
     This is hacky shortcut to removing the title from the page without having to manipulate CSS.
     Other major change is it removes all sections that aren't relevant to that page (tags, navlinks & comments). -->
