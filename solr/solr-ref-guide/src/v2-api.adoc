[[top-v2-api]]
The v2 API is a modernized self-documenting API interface covering most current Solr APIs. It is anticipated that once the v2 API reaches full coverage, and Solr-internal API usages like SolrJ and the Admin UI have been converted from the old API to the v2 API, the old API will eventually be retired.

For now the two API styles will coexist, and all the old APIs will continue to work without any change. You can disable all v2 API endpoints by starting your servers with this system property: `-Ddisable.v2.api=true`.

The old API and the v2 API differ in three principle ways:

.  Command format: The old API commands and associated parameters are provided through URL request parameters on HTTP GET requests, while in the v2 API most API commands are provided via a JSON body POST'ed to v2 API endpoints. The v2 API also supports HTTP methods GET and DELETE where appropriate.
.  Endpoint structure: The v2 API endpoint structure has been rationalized and regularized.
.  Documentation: The v2 APIs are self-documenting: append `/_introspect` to any valid v2 API path and the API specification will be returned in JSON format.

== v2 API Path Prefixes

Following are some v2 API URL paths and path prefixes, along with some of the operations that are supported at these paths and their sub-paths.

[width="100%",options="header",]
|===
|Path prefix |Some Supported Operations
|`/api/collections` or equivalently: `/api/c` |Create, alias, backup, and restore a collection.
|`/api/c/_collection-name_/update` |Update requests.
|`/api/c/_collection-name_/config` |Configuration requests.
|`/api/c/_collection-name_/schema` |Schema requests.
|`/api/c/_collection-name_/_handler-name_` |Handler-specific requests.
|`/api/c/_collection-name_/shards` |Split a shard, create a shard, add a replica.
|`/api/c/_collection-name_/shards/_shard-name_` |Delete a shard, force leader election
|`/api/c/_collection-name_/shards/_shard-name_/_replica-name_` |Delete a replica.
|`/api/cores` |Create a core.
|`/api/cores/_core-name_` |Reload, rename, delete, and unload a core.
|`/api/node` |Perform overseer operation, rejoin leader election.
|`/api/cluster` |Add role, remove role, set cluster property.
|`/api/c/.system/blob` |Upload and download blobs and metadata.
|===

== Introspect

Append `/_introspect` to any valid v2 API path and the API specification will be returned in JSON format.

`\http://localhost:8983/api/c/_introspect`

To limit the introspect output to include just one particular HTTP method, add the request parameter `method` with value `GET`, `POST`, or `DELETE`.

`\http://localhost:8983/api/c/_introspect?method=POST`

Most endpoints support commands provided in a body sent via POST. To limit the introspect output to only one command, add the request parameter `command=_command-name_`.

`\http://localhost:8983/api/c/gettingstarted/_introspect?method=POST&command=modify`

=== Interpreting the Introspect Output

Example: `\http://localhost:8983/api/c/gettingstarted/get/_introspect`

The `"commands"` section in the above example has one entry for each command supported at this endpoint. The key is the command name and the value is a JSON object describing the command structure using JSON schema (see http://json-schema.org/ for a description).

== Invocation Examples

For the "gettingstarted" collection, set the replication factor and whether to automatically add replicas (see above for the introspect output for the `"modify"` command used here):

[source,bash]
----
$ curl http://localhost:8983/api/c/gettingstarted -H 'Content-type:application/json' -d '
{ modify: { replicationFactor: "3" } }'

{"responseHeader":{"status":0,"QTime":842}}
----

See the state of the cluster:

[source,bash]
----
$ curl http://localhost:8983/api/cluster

{"responseHeader":{"status":0,"QTime":0},"collections":["gettingstarted",".system"]}
----

Set a cluster property:

[source,bash]
----
$ curl http://localhost:8983/api/cluster -H 'Content-type: application/json' -d '
{ set-property: { name: maxCoresPerNode, val: "100" } }'

{"responseHeader":{"status":0,"QTime":4}}
