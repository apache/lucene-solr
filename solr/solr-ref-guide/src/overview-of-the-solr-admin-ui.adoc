Solr features a Web interface that provides online access to many Solr configuration options and features.

== Dashboard

Accessing the URL `\http://hostname:8983/solr/` will show the main dashboard, which is divided into two parts.

.Solr Dashboard
image::images/overview-of-the-solr-admin-ui/dashboard.png[image,height=400]

The left-side of the screen is a menu under the Solr logo that provides the navigation through the screens of the UI.

The first set of links are for system-level information and configuration and provide access to <<logging.adoc#,Logging>>, <<collections-core-admin.adoc#,Collection/Core Administration>>, and <<java-properties.adoc#,Java Properties>>, among other things.

At the end of this information is at least one pulldown listing Solr cores configured for this instance.
On <<solrcloud.adoc#,SolrCloud>> nodes, an additional pulldown list shows all collections in this cluster.
Clicking on a collection or core name shows secondary menus of information for the specified collection or core, such as a <<schema-browser-screen.adoc#,Schema Browser>>, <<files-screen.adoc#,Config Files>>, <<plugins-stats-screen.adoc#,Plugins & Statistics>>, and an ability to perform <<query-screen.adoc#,Queries>> on indexed data.

The left-side navigation appears on every screen, while the center changes to  the detail of the option selected.
The Dashboard shows several information items in the center of the screen, including system uptime, the version being run, system-level data, JVM arguments, and the security plugins enabled (if any).

Under the covers, the Solr Admin UI uses the same HTTP APIs available to all clients to access Solr-related data to drive an external interface.

[TIP]
====
The path to the Solr Admin UI given above is `\http://hostname:port/solr`, which redirects to `\http://hostname:port/solr/\#/`. A convenience redirect is also supported, so simply accessing the Admin UI at `\http://hostname:port/` will also redirect to `\http://hostname:port/solr/#/`.
====

== Login Screen

If authentication has been enabled, Solr will present a login screen to unauthenticated users before allowing them further access to the Admin UI.

.Login Screen
image::images/overview-of-the-solr-admin-ui/login.png[]

This login screen currently only works with Basic Authentication.
See the section <<basic-authentication-plugin.adoc#,Basic Authentication Plugin>> for
 details on how to configure Solr to use this method of authentication.

Once logged in, the left-hand navigation will show the current user with an option to logout.

If Kerberos is enabled and the user has a valid ticket, the login screen will be skipped.
However, if the user does not have a valid ticket, they will see a message that they need to obtain a valid ticket before continuing.

== Schema Designer

The <<schema-designer.adoc#,Schema Designer>> screen provides an interactive experience to create a schema using sample data.

.Only Visible When Using SolrCloud
[NOTE]
====
The Schema Designer is only available on Solr instances running in <<solrcloud.adoc#,SolrCloud>> mode.
====

== Getting Assistance

At the bottom of each screen of the Admin UI is a set of links that can be used to get more assistance with configuring and using Solr.

.Assistance icons
image::images/getting-assistance/Assistance.png[image]

These icons include the following links.

// TODO: Change column width to %autowidth.spread when https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-pdf/issues/599 is fixed

[cols="25,75",options="header"]
