Solr features a Web interface that makes it easy for Solr administrators and programmers to view <<files-screen.adoc#files-screen,Solr configuration>> details, run <<query-screen.adoc#query-screen,queries and analyze>> document fields in order to fine-tune a Solr configuration and access <<Getting Assistance,online documentation>> and other help.

== Dashboard

Accessing the URL `\http://hostname:8983/solr/` will show the main dashboard, which is divided into two parts.

.Solr Dashboard
image::images/overview-of-the-solr-admin-ui/dashboard.png[image,height=400]

The left-side of the screen is a menu under the Solr logo that provides the navigation through the screens of the UI.

The first set of links are for system-level information and configuration and provide access to <<logging.adoc#logging,Logging>>, <<collections-core-admin.adoc#collections-core-admin,Collection/Core Administration>>, and <<java-properties.adoc#java-properties,Java Properties>>, among other things.

At the end of this information is at least one pulldown listing Solr cores configured for this instance. On <<solrcloud.adoc#solrcloud,SolrCloud>> nodes, an additional pulldown list shows all collections in this cluster. Clicking on a collection or core name shows secondary menus of information for the specified collection or core, such as a <<schema-browser-screen.adoc#schema-browser-screen,Schema Browser>>, <<files-screen.adoc#files-screen,Config Files>>, <<plugins-stats-screen.adoc#plugins-stats-screen,Plugins & Statistics>>, and an ability to perform <<query-screen.adoc#query-screen,Queries>> on indexed data.

The center of the screen shows the detail of the option selected. This may include a sub-navigation for the option or text or graphical representation of the requested data. See the sections in this guide for each screen for more details.

Under the covers, the Solr Admin UI re-uses the same HTTP APIs available to all clients to access Solr-related data to drive an external interface.

[TIP]
====
The path to the Solr Admin UI given above is `\http://hostname:port/solr`, which redirects to `\http://hostname:port/solr/\#/` in the current version. A convenience redirect is also supported, so simply accessing the Admin UI at `\http://hostname:port/` will also redirect to `\http://hostname:port/solr/#/`.

== Login Screen

If authentication has been enabled, Solr will present a login screen to unauthenticated users before allowing them further access to the Admin UI.

.Login Screen
image::images/overview-of-the-solr-admin-ui/login.png[]

This login screen currently only works with Basic Authentication.
See the section <<basic-authentication-plugin.adoc#basic-authentication-plugin,Basic Authentication Plugin>> for
 details on how to configure Solr to use this method of authentication.

If Kerberos is enabled and the user has a valid ticket, the login screen will be skipped.
However, if the user does not have a valid ticket, they will see a message that they need to obtain a valid ticket before continuing.

== Getting Assistance

At the bottom of each screen of the Admin UI is a set of links that can be used to get more assistance with configuring and using Solr.

.Assistance icons
image::images/getting-assistance/Assistance.png[image]

These icons include the following links.

// TODO: Change column width to %autowidth.spread when https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-pdf/issues/599 is fixed

[cols="25,75",options="header"]
