Solr can support https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON_Web_Token[JSON Web Token] (JWT) based Bearer authentication with the use of the JWTAuthPlugin. This allows Solr to assert that a user is already authenticated with an external https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_provider[Identity Provider] by validating that the JWT formatted https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Access_token[access token] is digitally signed by the Identity Provider. The typical use case is to integrate Solr with an https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenID_Connect[OpenID Connect] enabled IdP.

== Enable JWT Authentication

To use JWT Bearer authentication, the `security.json` file must have an `authentication` part which defines the class being used for authentication along with configuration parameters.

The simplest possible `security.json` for registering the plugin without configuration is:

[source,json]
----
{
  "authentication": {
    "class":"solr.JWTAuthPlugin",
    "blockUnknown":"false"
  }
}
----

The plugin will by default require a valid JWT token for all traffic. If the `blockUnknown` property is set to false as in the above example, it is possible to start configuring the plugin using unauthenticated REST API calls, which is further described in section <<editing-jwt-authentication-plugin-configuration,Editing JWT Authentication Plugin Configuration>>.

== Configuration Parameters

//TODO: standard is not to put parameters in tables but use labeled lists instead
[%header,format=csv,separator=;,cols="25%,50%,25%"]
|===
Key                  ; Description                                             ; Default
blockUnknown         ; Set to `false` to if you need to perform configuration through REST API or if you use an Authorization Plugin and only want certain paths protected. By default all requests will require a token  ; `true`
realm                ; Name of the authentication realm to echo back in HTTP 401 responses. Will also be displayed in Admin UI login page ; 'solr-jwt'
scope                ; Whitespace separated list of valid scopes. If configured, the JWT access token MUST contain a `scope` claim with at least one of the listed scopes. Example: `solr:read solr:admin` ;
requireIss           ; Fails requests that lacks an `iss` (issuer) claim                          ; `true`
requireExp           ; Fails requests that lacks an `exp` (expiry time) claim                     ; `true`
algWhitelist         ; JSON array with algorithms to accept: `HS256`, `HS384`, `HS512`, `RS256`, `RS384`, `RS512`, `ES256`, `ES384`, `ES512`, `PS256`, `PS384`, `PS512`, `none  ; Default is to allow all algorithms
jwkCacheDur          ; Duration of JWK cache in seconds                        ; `3600` (1 hour)
principalClaim       ; What claim id to pull principal from                    ; `sub`
rolesClaim           ; What claim id to pull user roles from. The claim must then either contain a space separated list of roles or a JSON array. The roles can then be used to define fine-grained access in an Authorization plugin       ; By default the scopes from `scope` claim are passed on as user roles
claimsMatch          ; JSON object of claims (key) that must match a regular expression (value). Example: `{ "foo" : "A|B" }` will require the `foo` claim to be either "A" or "B". ;
adminUiScope         ; Define what scope is requested when logging in from Admin UI ; If not defined, the first scope from `scope` parameter is used
redirectUris         ; Valid location(s) for redirect after external authentication. Takes a string or array of strings. Must be the base URL of Solr, e.g., https://solr1.example.com:8983/solr/ and must match the list of redirect URIs registered with the Identity Provider beforehand. ; Defaults to empty list, i.e., any node is assumed to be a valid redirect target.
issuers              ; List of issuers (Identity providers) to  support. See section <<issuer-configuration,Issuer configuration>> for configuration syntax ;
|===

=== Issuer Configuration

This plugin supports one or more token issuers (IdPs). Issuers are configured as a list of JSON objects under the `issuers` configuration key. The first issuer in the list is the "Primary Issuer", which is the one used for logging in to the Admin UI.

|===
Key                  ; Description                                             ; Default
name                 ; A unique name of the issuer. Used to manipulate list through API. ;
wellKnownUrl         ; URL to an https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-discovery-1_0.html[OpenID Connect Discovery] endpoint ;
clientId             ; Client identifier for use with OpenID Connect. Required to authenticate with Admin UI. Needed for primary issuer only ;
jwksUrl              ; A URL to a https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7517#section-5[JWKs] endpoint. Must use https protocol. Optionally an array of URLs in which case all public keys from all URLs will be consulted when validating signatures. ; Auto configured if `wellKnownUrl` is provided
jwk                  ; As an alternative to `jwksUrl` you may provide a static JSON object containing the public key(s) of the issuer. The format is either JWK or JWK Set, see https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7517#appendix-A[RFC7517] for examples. ;
iss                  ; Unique issuer id as configured on the IdP. Incoming tokens must have a matching `iss` claim. Also used to resolve issuer when multiple issuers configured.      ; Auto configured if `wellKnownUrl` is provided
aud                  ; Validates that the `aud` (audience) claim equals this string      ; Uses `clientId` if configured
authorizationEndpoint; The URL for the Id Provider's authorization endpoint ; Auto configured if `wellKnownUrl` is provided
|===

TIP: For backwards compatibility, all the configuration keys for the primary issuer may be configured as top-level keys, except `name`.

== More Configuration Examples
=== With JWKS URL
To start enforcing authentication for all users, requiring a valid JWT in the `Authorization` header, you need to configure the plugin with one or more https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7517[JSON Web Key]s (JWK). This is a JSON document containing the key used to sign/encrypt the JWT. It could be a symmetric or asymmetric key. The JWK can either be fetched (and cached) from an external HTTPS endpoint or specified directly in `security.json`. Below is an example of the former:

[source,json]
----
{
  "authentication": {
    "class": "solr.JWTAuthPlugin",
    "jwksUrl": "https://my.key.server/jwk.json"
  }
}
----

TIP: The configuration key `jwkUrl` is also supported as an alternative to `jwksUrl` for backwards compatibility with early versions of the plugin.

=== With Admin UI Support
The next example shows configuring using https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-discovery-1_0.html[OpenID Connect Discovery] with a well-known URI for automatic configuration of many common settings, including ability to use the Admin UI with an OpenID Connect enabled Identity Provider.

[source,json]
----
{
  "authentication": {
    "class": "solr.JWTAuthPlugin",
    "wellKnownUrl": "https://idp.example.com/.well-known/openid-configuration",
    "clientId": "xyz",
    "redirectUris": "https://my.solr.server:8983/solr/"
  }
}
----

In this case, `jwksUrl`, `iss` and `authorizationEndpoint` will be automatically configured from the fetched configuration.

=== Complex Example
Let's look at a more complex configuration, this time with two issuers configured, where one uses a static embedded JWK:

[source,json]
----
{
  "authentication": {
    "class": "solr.JWTAuthPlugin", <1>
    "blockUnknown": true, <2>
    "principalClaim": "solruid", <3>
    "claimsMatch": { "foo" : "A|B", "dept" : "IT" }, <4>
    "scope": "solr:read solr:write solr:admin", <5>
    "algWhitelist" : [ "RS256", "RS384", "RS512" ], <6>
    "issuers": [ <7>
      {
        "name": "example1-static", <8>
        "jwk": { <9>
          "e": "AQAB",
          "kid": "k1",
          "kty": "RSA",
          "n": "3ZF6w....vjbCXxw"
        },
        "clientId": "solr-client-12345", <10>
        "iss": "https://example.com/idp", <11>
        "aud": "https://example.com/solr" <12>
      },
      {
        "name": "example2",
        "wellKnownUrl": "https://example2.com/.well-known/oidc", <13>
        "aud": "https://example2.com/solr"
      }
    ]
  }
}
----

Let's comment on this config:

<1> Plugin class
<2> Make sure to block anyone without a valid token (this is also the default)
<3> Fetch the user id from another claim than the default `sub`
<4> Require that the `roles` claim is one of "A" or "B" and that the `dept` claim is "IT"
<5> Require one of the scopes `solr:read`, `solr:write` or `solr:admin`
<6> Only accept RSA algorithms for signatures
<7> Array of issuer configurations
<8> Each issuer object should have a unique name
<9> Here we pass the JWK inline instead of referring to a URL with `jwksUrl`
<10> Set the client id registered with Identity Provider
<11> Configure the issuer id. Will be used for validating tokens. A token's 'iss' claim must match one of the configured issuer IDs.
<12> Configure the audience claim. A token's 'aud' claim must match 'aud' for one of the configured issuers.
<13> This issuer is auto configured through discovery, so 'iss' and JWK settings are not required

=== Using non SSL URLs
In production environments you should always use SSL protected HTTPS connections, otherwise you open yourself up to attacks.
However, in development, it may be useful to use regular http urls, and bypass the
security check that Solr performs. To support this you can set the environment variable `solr.auth.jwt.allowOutboundHttp=true`.

== Editing JWT Authentication Plugin Configuration

All properties mentioned above can be set or changed using the <<basic-authentication-plugin.adoc#editing-basic-authentication-plugin-configuration,Authentication API>>. You can thus start with a simple configuration with only `class` and `blockUnknown=false` configured and then configure the rest using the API.

=== Set a Configuration Property

Set properties for the authentication plugin. Each of the configuration keys in the table above can be used as parameter keys for the `set-property` command.

Example:

[.dynamic-tabs]
--
[example.tab-pane#jwt-v1set-property]
====
[.tab-label]*V1 API*

[source,bash]
----
curl http://localhost:8983/solr/admin/authentication -H 'Content-type:application/json' -H 'Authorization: Bearer xxx.yyy.zzz' -d '{"set-property": {"blockUnknown":true, "wellKnownUrl": "https://example.com/.well-knwon/openid-configuration", "scope": "solr:read solr:write"}}'
----
====

[example.tab-pane#jwt-v2set-property]
====
[.tab-label]*V2 API*

[source,bash]
----
curl http://localhost:8983/api/cluster/security/authentication -H 'Content-type:application/json' -H 'Authorization: Bearer xxx.yyy.zzz' -d -d '{"set-property": {"blockUnknown":true, "wellKnownUrl": "https://example.com/.well-knwon/openid-configuration", "scope": "solr:read solr:write"}}'
----
====
--

Insert a valid JWT access token in compact serialization format (`xxx.yyy.zzz` above) to authenticate with Solr once the plugin is active, or leave `blockUnknown=false` until configuration is complete and then switch it to `true` to start enforcing.

NOTE: There is currently no support for adding multiple token issuers though REST API, but you can configure one issuer through the API by using the 'issuer' properties as top-level properties.

== Using Clients with JWT Auth

[#jwt-soljr]
=== SolrJ

SolrJ does not currently support supplying JWT tokens per request.

[#jwt-curl]
=== cURL

To authenticate with Solr when using the cURL utility, supply a valid JWT access token in an `Authorization` header, as follows (replace xxxxxx.xxxxxx.xxxxxx with your JWT compact token):

[source,bash]
----
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer xxxxxx.xxxxxx.xxxxxx" http://localhost:8983/solr/admin/info/system
----

=== Admin UI

When this plugin is enabled, users will be redirected to a login page in the Admin UI once they attempt to do a restricted action. The page has a button that users will click and be redirected to the Identity Provider's login page. If more than one issuer (IdP) is configured, the first in the list will be used for Admin UI. Once authenticated, the user will be redirected back to Solr Admin UI to the last known location. The session will last as long as the JWT token expiry time and is valid for one Solr server only. That means you have to login again when navigating to another Solr node. There is also a logout menu in the left column where user can explicitly log out.

== Using the Solr Control Script with JWT Auth

The control script (`bin/solr`) does not currently support JWT Auth.
