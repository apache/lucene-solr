A field type defines the analysis that will occur on a field when documents are indexed or queries are sent to the index.

A field type definition can include four types of information:

* The name of the field type (mandatory).
* An implementation class name (mandatory).
* If the field type is `TextField`, a description of the field analysis for the field type.
* Field type properties - depending on the implementation class, some properties may be mandatory.

== Field Type Definitions in schema.xml

Field types are defined in `schema.xml`. Each field type is defined between `fieldType` elements. They can optionally be grouped within a `types` element. Here is an example of a field type definition for a type called `text_general`:

[source,xml,subs="verbatim,callouts"]
----
<fieldType name="text_general" class="solr.TextField" positionIncrementGap="100"> --<1>
  <analyzer type="index"> --<2>
    <tokenizer class="solr.StandardTokenizerFactory"/>
    <filter class="solr.StopFilterFactory" ignoreCase="true" words="stopwords.txt" />
    <!-- in this example, we will only use synonyms at query time
    <filter class="solr.SynonymFilterFactory" synonyms="index_synonyms.txt" ignoreCase="true" expand="false"/>
    -->
    <filter class="solr.LowerCaseFilterFactory"/>
  </analyzer>
  <analyzer type="query">
    <tokenizer class="solr.StandardTokenizerFactory"/>
    <filter class="solr.StopFilterFactory" ignoreCase="true" words="stopwords.txt" />
    <filter class="solr.SynonymFilterFactory" synonyms="synonyms.txt" ignoreCase="true" expand="true"/>
    <filter class="solr.LowerCaseFilterFactory"/>
  </analyzer>
</fieldType>
----

<1> The first line in the example above contains the field type name, `text_general`, and the name of the implementing class, `solr.TextField`.
<2> The rest of the definition is about field analysis, described in <<understanding-analyzers-tokenizers-and-filters.adoc#understanding-analyzers-tokenizers-and-filters,Understanding Analyzers, Tokenizers, and Filters>>.

The implementing class is responsible for making sure the field is handled correctly. In the class names in `schema.xml`, the string `solr` is shorthand for `org.apache.solr.schema` or `org.apache.solr.analysis`. Therefore, `solr.TextField` is really `org.apache.solr.schema.TextField`.

== Field Type Properties

The field type `class` determines most of the behavior of a field type, but optional properties can also be defined. For example, the following definition of a date field type defines two properties, `sortMissingLast` and `omitNorms`.

[source,xml]
----
<fieldType name="date" class="solr.DatePointField"
           sortMissingLast="true" omitNorms="true"/>
----

The properties that can be specified for a given field type fall into three major categories:

* Properties specific to the field type's class.
* <<General Properties>> Solr supports for any field type.
* <<Field Default Properties>> that can be specified on the field type that will be inherited by fields that use this type instead of the default behavior.

=== General Properties

These are the general properties for fields:

`name`::
The name of the fieldType. This value gets used in field definitions, in the "type" attribute. It is strongly recommended that names consist of alphanumeric or underscore characters only and not start with a digit. This is not currently strictly enforced.

`class`::
The class name that gets used to store and index the data for this type. Note that you may prefix included class names with "solr." and Solr will automatically figure out which packages to search for the class - so `solr.TextField` will work.
+
If you are using a third-party class, you will probably need to have a fully qualified class name. The fully qualified equivalent for `solr.TextField` is `org.apache.solr.schema.TextField`.

`positionIncrementGap`::
For multivalued fields, specifies a distance between multiple values, which prevents spurious phrase matches.

`autoGeneratePhraseQueries`:: For text fields. If `true`, Solr automatically generates phrase queries for adjacent terms. If `false`, terms must be enclosed in double-quotes to be treated as phrases.

`synonymQueryStyle`::
Query used to combine scores of overlapping query terms (i.e., synonyms). Consider a search for "blue tee" with query-time synonyms `tshirt,tee`.
+
Use `as_same_term` (default) to blend terms, i.e., `SynonymQuery(tshirt,tee)` where each term will be treated as equally important. Use `pick_best` to select the most significant synonym when scoring `Dismax(tee,tshirt)`. Use `as_distinct_terms` to bias scoring towards the most significant synonym `(pants OR slacks)`.
+
`as_same_term` is appropriate when terms are true synonyms (television, tv). Use `pick_best` or `as_distinct_terms` when synonyms are expanding to hyponyms `(q=jeans w/ jeans\=>jeans,pants)` and you want exact to come before parent and sibling concepts. See this http://opensourceconnections.com/blog/2017/11/21/solr-synonyms-mea-culpa/[blog article].

`enableGraphQueries`::
For text fields, applicable when querying with <<the-standard-query-parser.adoc#standard-query-parser-parameters,`sow=false`>> (which is the default for the `sow` parameter). Use `true`, the default, for field types with query analyzers including graph-aware filters, e.g., <<filter-descriptions.adoc#synonym-graph-filter,Synonym Graph Filter>> and <<filter-descriptions.adoc#word-delimiter-graph-filter,Word Delimiter Graph Filter>>.
+
Use `false` for field types with query analyzers including filters that can match docs when some tokens are missing, e.g., <<filter-descriptions.adoc#shingle-filter,Shingle Filter>>.

`analyzedDocValues`::
For text fields. If `true`, SortedSet docValues associated directly with the configured field will be generated from post-analysis terms at index time. This can be useful, e.g., for the "facet on everything" use case, or for sorting on normalized (single-token analyzed) versions of the input field.

NOTE: `analyzedDocValues` defaults to `true` for TextField, but has no effect if `docValues=false`.

`maxDocValuesBytes`::
For text fields. Declares a maximum supported byte length for "value-access"-type docValues (e.g., for `useDocValuesAsStored`, export, streaming expressions, functions, and atomic updates). The default value of 32766 is the maximum number of bytes for terms in the terms dictionary. This value may be set arbitrarily higher to signal the fieldType to use an internal docValues representation that supports larger field values. If configured, lower values will also be enforced. The value `-1` is interpreted as "no limit". Setting this value explicitly implies `useDocValuesAsStored=true`

`dvSortType` / `dvSortSuffix` / `maxCharsForDocValues`::
For text fields. Optional args that provide finer-grained control over how field values are handled for the purpose of sorting. `maxCharsForDocValues` sets a maximum number of characters that will be recorded in docValues at index time for the purpose of sorting. `dvSortType` and `dvSortSuffix` are mutually exclusive, and allow the specification of an explicitly declared fieldType or dynamic field (respectively) that will be used to mediate read- and write-access to docValues used for sorting for this field. This can be used, e.g., to do case normalization for the purpose of sort over a field with non-normalized input.

NOTE: when delegating to an _analyzed_ `dvSortType` or `dvSortSuffix`, `maxCharsForDocValues` should be set, if desired, directly on the delegate fieldType.

`dvStoredType` / `dvStoredSuffix`::
For text fields. Optional, mutually exclusive args that allow the explicit declaration of a fieldType or dynamic field (respectively) that will be used to mediate read- and write-access to docValues used for value-access against this field (e.g., for `useDocValuesAsStored`, export, streaming expressions, functions, and atomic updates).

`dvPurpose`::
An "expert" argument, and entirely optional. May be used to disable "polyField" behavior on some polyFields (currently only TextField), by declaring a specific purpose. This could for example be used to set `dvPurpose=sort` on a fieldType specified as a `dvSortType` by another field (see above). Explicitly configuring this arg implies `docValues=true`.

[[docvaluesformat]]
`docValuesFormat`::
Defines a custom `DocValuesFormat` to use for fields of this type. This requires that a schema-aware codec, such as the `SchemaCodecFactory`, has been configured in `solrconfig.xml`.

`postingsFormat`::
Defines a custom `PostingsFormat` to use for fields of this type. This requires that a schema-aware codec, such as the `SchemaCodecFactory`, has been configured in `solrconfig.xml`.


[NOTE]
====
Lucene index back-compatibility is only supported for the default codec. If you choose to customize the `postingsFormat` or `docValuesFormat` in your `schema.xml`, upgrading to a future version of Solr may require you to either switch back to the default codec and optimize your index to rewrite it into the default codec before upgrading, or re-build your entire index from scratch after upgrading.

=== Field Default Properties

These are properties that can be specified either on the field types, or on individual fields to override the values provided by the field types.

The default values for each property depend on the underlying `FieldType` class, which in turn may depend on the `version` attribute of the `<schema/>`. The table below includes the default value for most `FieldType` implementations provided by Solr, assuming a `schema.xml` that declares `version="1.6"`.

// TODO: SOLR-10655 BEGIN: refactor this into a 'field-default-properties.include.adoc' file for reuse

// TODO: Change column width to %autowidth.spread when https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-pdf/issues/599 is fixed

[cols="20,40,20,20",options="header"]
|===
|Property |Description |Values |Implicit Default
|indexed |If true, the value of the field can be used in queries to retrieve matching documents. |true or false |true
|stored |If true, the actual value of the field can be retrieved by queries. |true or false |true
|docValues |If true, the value of the field will be put in a column-oriented <<docvalues.adoc#docvalues,DocValues>> structure. |true or false |false
|sortMissingFirst sortMissingLast |Control the placement of documents when a sort field is not present. |true or false |false
|multiValued |If true, indicates that a single document might contain multiple values for this field type. |true or false |false
|uninvertible|If true, indicates that an `indexed="true" docValues="false"` field can be "un-inverted" at query time to build up large in memory data structure to serve in place of <<docvalues.adoc#docvalues,DocValues>>.  *Defaults to true for historical reasons, but users are strongly encouraged to set this to `false` for stability and use `docValues="true"` as needed.*|true or false |true
|omitNorms |If true, omits the norms associated with this field (this disables length normalization for the field, and saves some memory). *Defaults to true for all primitive (non-analyzed) field types, such as int, float, data, bool, and string.* Only full-text fields or fields need norms. |true or false |*
|omitTermFreqAndPositions |If true, omits term frequency, positions, and payloads from postings for this field. This can be a performance boost for fields that don't require that information. It also reduces the storage space required for the index. Queries that rely on position that are issued on a field with this option will silently fail to find documents. *This property defaults to true for all field types that are not text fields.* |true or false |*
|omitPositions |Similar to `omitTermFreqAndPositions` but preserves term frequency information. |true or false |*
|termVectors termPositions termOffsets termPayloads |These options instruct Solr to maintain full term vectors for each document, optionally including position, offset and payload information for each term occurrence in those vectors. These can be used to accelerate highlighting and other ancillary functionality, but impose a substantial cost in terms of index size. They are not necessary for typical uses of Solr. |true or false |false
|required |Instructs Solr to reject any attempts to add a document which does not have a value for this field. This property defaults to false. |true or false |false
|useDocValuesAsStored |If the field has <<docvalues.adoc#docvalues,docValues>> enabled, setting this to true would allow the field to be returned as if it were a stored field (even if it has `stored=false`) when matching "`*`" in an <<common-query-parameters.adoc#fl-field-list-parameter,fl parameter>>. |true or false |true
|large |Large fields are always lazy loaded and will only take up space in the document cache if the actual value is < 512KB. This option requires `stored="true"` and `multiValued="false"`. It's intended for fields that might have very large values so that they don't get cached in memory. |true or false |false
|===

// TODO: SOLR-10655 END

== Field Type Similarity

A field type may optionally specify a `<similarity/>` that will be used when scoring documents that refer to fields with this type, as long as the "global" similarity for the collection allows it.

By default, any field type which does not define a similarity, uses `BM25Similarity`. For more details, and examples of configuring both global & per-type Similarities, please see <<other-schema-elements.adoc#similarity,Other Schema Elements>>.
