When running in <<solrcloud.adoc#solrcloud,SolrCloud>> mode, a "Cloud" option will appear in the Admin UI between <<logging.adoc#logging,Logging>> and <<collections-core-admin.adoc#collections-core-admin,Collections>>.

This screen provides status information about each collection & node in your cluster, as well as access to the low level data being stored in <<using-zookeeper-to-manage-configuration-files.adoc#using-zookeeper-to-manage-configuration-files,ZooKeeper>>.

.Only Visible When using SolrCloud
[NOTE]
====
The "Cloud" menu option is only available on Solr instances running in <<getting-started-with-solrcloud.adoc#getting-started-with-solrcloud,SolrCloud mode>>. Single node or master/slave replication instances of Solr will not display this option.
====

Click on the Cloud option in the left-hand navigation, and a small sub-menu appears with options called "Tree", "Graph", and "Graph (Radial)". The default view ("Graph") shows a graph of each collection, the shards that make up those collections, and the addresses and type ("NRT", "TLOG" or "PULL") of each replica for each shard.

This example shows a simple cluster. In addition to the 2 shard, 2 replica "gettingstarted" collection, there is an additional "tlog" collection consisting of mixed TLOG and PULL replica types.

Tooltips appear when hovering over each replica giving additional information.

The "Graph (Radial)" option provides a different visual view of each node. Using the same example cluster, the radial graph view looks like:

The "Tree" option shows a directory structure of the data in ZooKeeper, including cluster wide information regarding the `live_nodes` and `overseer` status, as well as collection specific information such as the `state.json`, current shard leaders, and configuration files in use. In this example, we see part of the `state.json`  definition for the "tlog" collection:

As an aid to debugging, the data shown in the "Tree" view can be exported locally using the following command `bin/solr zk ls -r /`
