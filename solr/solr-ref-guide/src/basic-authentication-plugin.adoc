Solr can support Basic authentication for users with the use of the BasicAuthPlugin.

An authorization plugin is also available to configure Solr with permissions to perform various activities in the system. The authorization plugin is described in the section <<rule-based-authorization-plugin.adoc#rule-based-authorization-plugin,Rule-Based Authorization Plugin>>.

== Enable Basic Authentication

To use Basic authentication, you must first create a `security.json` file. This file and where to put it is described in detail in the section <<authentication-and-authorization-plugins.adoc#enable-plugins-with-security-json,Enable Plugins with security.json>>.

For Basic authentication, the `security.json` file must have an `authentication` part which defines the class being used for authentication. Usernames and passwords (as a sha256(password+salt) hash) could be added when the file is created, or can be added later with the Basic authentication API, described below.

The `authorization` part is not related to Basic authentication, but is a separate authorization plugin designed to support fine-grained user access control. For more information, see the section <<rule-based-authorization-plugin.adoc#rule-based-authorization-plugin,Rule-Based Authorization Plugin>>.

An example `security.json` showing both sections is shown below to show how these plugins can work together:

[source,json]
----
{
"authentication":{ <1>
   "blockUnknown": true, <2>
   "class":"solr.BasicAuthPlugin",
   "credentials":{"solr":"IV0EHq1OnNrj6gvRCwvFwTrZ1+z1oBbnQdiVC3otuq0= Ndd7LKvVBAaZIF0QAVi1ekCfAJXr1GGfLtRUXhgrF8c="} <3>
},
"authorization":{
   "class":"solr.RuleBasedAuthorizationPlugin",
   "permissions":[{"name":"security-edit",
      "role":"admin"}], <4>
   "user-role":{"solr":"admin"} <5>
}}
----

There are several things defined in this file:

<1> Basic authentication and rule-based authorization plugins are enabled.
<2> A user called 'solr', with a password `'SolrRocks'` has been defined.
<3> The parameter `"blockUnknown":true` means that unauthenticated requests are not allowed to pass through.
<4> The 'admin' role has been defined, and it has permission to edit security settings.
<5> The 'solr' user has been defined to the 'admin' role.

Save your settings to a file called `security.json` locally. If you are using Solr in standalone mode, you should put this file in `$SOLR_HOME`.

If `blockUnknown` does not appear in the `security.json` file, it will default to `false`. This has the effect of not requiring authentication at all. In some cases, you may want this; for example, if you want to have `security.json` in place but aren't ready to enable authentication. However, you will want to ensure that this parameter is set to `true` in order for authentication to be truly enabled in your system.

If you are using SolrCloud, you must upload `security.json` to ZooKeeper. You can use this example command, ensuring that the ZooKeeper port is correct:

[source,bash]
----
bin/solr zk cp file:path_to_local_security.json zk:/security.json -z localhost:9983
----

=== Caveats

There are a few things to keep in mind when using the Basic authentication plugin.

* Credentials are sent in plain text by default. It's recommended to use SSL for communication when Basic authentication is enabled, as described in the section <<enabling-ssl.adoc#enabling-ssl,Enabling SSL>>.
* A user who has access to write permissions to `security.json` will be able to modify all the permissions and how users have been assigned permissions. Special care should be taken to only grant access to editing security to appropriate users.
* Your network should, of course, be secure. Even with Basic authentication enabled, you should not unnecessarily expose Solr to the outside world.

== Editing Authentication Plugin Configuration

An Authentication API allows modifying user IDs and passwords. The API provides an endpoint with specific commands to set user details or delete a user.

=== API Entry Point

`admin/authentication`

This endpoint is not collection-specific, so users are created for the entire Solr cluster. If users need to be restricted to a specific collection, that can be done with the authorization rules.

=== Add a User or Edit a Password

The `set-user` command allows you to add users and change their passwords. For example, the following defines two users and their passwords:

[source,bash]
----
curl --user solr:SolrRocks http://localhost:8983/solr/admin/authentication -H 'Content-type:application/json' -d '{
  "set-user": {"tom" : "TomIsCool" ,
               "harry":"HarrysSecret"}}'
----

=== Delete a User

The `delete-user` command allows you to remove a user. The user password does not need to be sent to remove a user. In the following example, we've asked that user IDs 'tom' and 'harry' be removed from the system.

[source,bash]
----
curl --user solr:SolrRocks http://localhost:8983/solr/admin/authentication -H 'Content-type:application/json' -d  '{
 "delete-user": ["tom","harry"]}'
----

=== Set a Property

Set arbitrary properties for authentication plugin. The only supported property is `'blockUnknown'`

[source,bash]
----
curl --user solr:SolrRocks http://localhost:8983/solr/admin/authentication -H 'Content-type:application/json' -d  '{
 "set-property": {"blockUnknown":false}}'
----

=== Using BasicAuth with SolrJ

In SolrJ, the basic authentication credentials need to be set for each request as in this example:

[source,java]
----
SolrRequest req ;//create a new request object
req.setBasicAuthCredentials(userName, password);
solrClient.request(req);
----

Query example:

[source,java]
----
QueryRequest req = new QueryRequest(new SolrQuery("*:*"));
req.setBasicAuthCredentials(userName, password);
QueryResponse rsp = req.process(solrClient);
----

=== Using Command Line scripts with BasicAuth

Add the following line to the `solr.in.sh` or `solr.in.cmd` file. This example tells the `bin/solr` command line to to use "basic" as the type of authentication, and to pass credentials with the user-name "solr" and password "SolrRocks":

[source,bash]
----
SOLR_AUTH_TYPE="basic"
SOLR_AUTHENTICATION_OPTS="-Dbasicauth=solr:SolrRocks"
----
