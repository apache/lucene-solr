This section exposes potential techniques which can be used for searching deeply nested documents,
show casing how more complex queries can be constructed using some of Solr's query parsers and Doc Transformers.
These features require `\_root_` and `\_nest_path_` to be declared in the schema. +
Please refer to the <<indexing-nested-documents.adoc#indexing-nested-documents, Indexing Nested Documents>>
section for more details about schema and index configuration.


[NOTE]
This section does not show case faceting on nested documents. For nested document faceting, please refer to the
<<json-facet-api#uniqueblock-and-block-join-counts, Block Join Facet Counts>> section.

== Query Examples

For the upcoming examples, we'll assume an index containing the same documents covered in <<indexing-nested-documents#example-indexing-syntax,Indexing Nested Documents>>:

include::indexing-nested-documents.adoc[tag=sample-indexing-deeply-nested-documents]

=== Child Doc Transformer

By default, documents that match a query do not include any of their nested children in the response.  The `[child]` Doc Transformer Can be used enrich query results with the documents' descendants.

For a detailed explanation of this transformer, and specifics on it's syntax & limitations, please refer to the section <<transforming-result-documents.adoc#child-childdoctransformerfactory, [child] - ChildDocTransformerFactory>>.

A simple query matching all documents with a description that includes "staplers":

[source,bash]
----
$ curl 'http://localhost:8983/solr/gettingstarted/select?omitHeader=true&q=description_t:staplers'
{
  "response":{"numFound":1,"start":0,"maxScore":0.30136836,"numFoundExact":true,"docs":[
      {
        "id":"P11!prod",
        "name_s":"Swingline Stapler",
        "description_t":"The Cadillac of office staplers ...",
        "_version_":1672933224035123200}]
  }}
----

The same query with the addition of the `[child]` transformer is shown below.  Note that the `numFound` has not changed, we are still matching the same set of documents, but when returning those documents the nested children are also returned as psuedo-fields.

[source,bash]
----
$ curl 'http://localhost:8983/solr/gettingstarted/select?omitHeader=true&q=description_t:staplers&fl=*,[child]'
{
  "response":{"numFound":1,"start":0,"maxScore":0.30136836,"numFoundExact":true,"docs":[
      {
        "id":"P11!prod",
        "name_s":"Swingline Stapler",
        "description_t":"The Cadillac of office staplers ...",
        "_version_":1672933224035123200,
        "skus":[
          {
            "id":"P11!S21",
            "color_s":"RED",
            "price_i":42,
            "_version_":1672933224035123200,
            "manuals":[
              {
                "id":"P11!D41",
                "name_s":"Red Swingline Brochure",
                "pages_i":1,
                "content_t":"...",
                "_version_":1672933224035123200}]},
          
          {
            "id":"P11!S31",
            "color_s":"BLACK",
            "price_i":3,
            "_version_":1672933224035123200}],
        "manuals":[

            "name_s":"Warranty Details",
            "pages_i":42,
            "content_t":"... lifetime guarantee ...",
            "_version_":1672933224035123200}]}]
  }}

=== Child Query Parser

The `{!child}` query parser can be used to search for the _descendent_ documents of parent documents matching a wrapped query. For a detailed explanation of this parser, see the section <<other-parsers.adoc#block-join-children-query-parser, Block Join Children Query Parser>>.

Let's consider again the `description_t:staplers` query used above -- if we wrap that query in a `{!child}` query parser then instead of "matching" & returning the product level documents, we instead match all of the _descendent_ child documents of the original query:

[source,bash]
----
$ curl 'http://localhost:8983/solr/gettingstarted/select' -d 'omitHeader=true' -d 'q={!child of="*:* -_nest_path_:*"}description_t:staplers'
{
  "response":{"numFound":5,"start":0,"maxScore":0.30136836,"numFoundExact":true,"docs":[
      {
        "id":"P11!D41",
        "name_s":"Red Swingline Brochure",
        "pages_i":1,
        "content_t":"...",
        "_version_":1672933224035123200},
      {
        "id":"P11!S21",
        "color_s":"RED",
        "price_i":42,
        "_version_":1672933224035123200},
      {
        "id":"P11!S31",
        "color_s":"BLACK",
        "price_i":3,
        "_version_":1672933224035123200},
      {
        "id":"P11!D51",
        "name_s":"Quick Reference Guide",
        "pages_i":1,
        "content_t":"How to use your stapler ...",
        "_version_":1672933224035123200},
      {
        "id":"P11!D61",
        "name_s":"Warranty Details",
        "pages_i":42,
        "content_t":"... lifetime guarantee ...",
        "_version_":1672933224035123200}]
  }}
----

In this example we've used `\*:* -\_nest_path_:*` as our <<other-parsers#block-mask,`of` parameter>> to indicate we want to consider all documents which don't have a nest path -- ie: all "root" level document -- as the set of possible parents.

By changing the `of` param to match ancestors at specific `\_nest_path_` levels, we can narrow down the list of children we return.  In the query below, we search for all descendents of `skus` (using an `of` param that identifies all documents that do _not_ have a `\_nest_path_` with the prefix `/skus/*`) with a `price_i` less then `50`:

[source,bash]
----
$ curl 'http://localhost:8983/solr/gettingstarted/select' -d 'omitHeader=true' --data-urlencode 'q={!child of="*:* -_nest_path_:\\/skus\\/*"}(+price_i:[* TO 50] +_nest_path_:\/skus)'
{
  "response":{"numFound":1,"start":0,"maxScore":1.0,"numFoundExact":true,"docs":[
      {
        "id":"P11!D41",
        "name_s":"Red Swingline Brochure",
        "pages_i":1,
        "content_t":"...",
        "_version_":1675662666752851968}]
  }}

[#double-escaping-nest-path-slashes]
[CAUTION]
.Double Escaping `\_nest_path_` slashes in `of`
====
Note that in the above example, the `/` characters in the `\_nest_path_` were "double escaped" in the `of` parameter:

* One level of `\` escaping is neccessary to prevent the `/` from being interpreted as a {lucene-javadocs}/queryparser/org/apache/lucene/queryparser/classic/package-summary.html#Regexp_Searches[Regex Query]
* An additional level of "escaping the escape character" is neccessary because the `of` local parameter is a quoted string; so we need a second `\` to ensure the first `\` is preserved and passed as is to the query parser.

(You can see that only a single level of of `\` escaping is needed in the body of the query string -- to prevent the Regex syntax --  because it's not a quoted string local param)

You may find it more convinient to use <<local-parameters-in-queries#parameter-dereferencing,parameter references>> in conjunction with <<other-parsers#other-parsers,other parsers>> that do not treat `/` as a special character to express the same query in a more verbose form:

[source,bash]
----
curl 'http://localhost:8983/solr/gettingstarted/select' -d 'omitHeader=true' --data-urlencode 'q={!child of=$block_mask}(+price_i:[* TO 50] +{!field f="_nest_path_" v="/skus"})' --data-urlencode 'block_mask=(*:* -{!prefix f="_nest_path_" v="/skus/"})'
----

====


=== Parent Query Parser

The inverse of the `{!child}` query parser is the `{!parent}` query parser, which let's you search for the _ancestor_ documents of some child documents matching a wrapped query.  For a detailed explanation of this parser, see the section <<other-parsers.adoc#block-join-parent-query-parser,Block Join Parent Query Parser>>.

Let's first consider this example of searching for all "manual" type documents that have exactly `1` page:

[source,bash]
----
$ curl 'http://localhost:8983/solr/gettingstarted/select?omitHeader=true&q=pages_i:1'
{
  "response":{"numFound":3,"start":0,"maxScore":1.0,"numFoundExact":true,"docs":[
      {
        "id":"P11!D41",
        "name_s":"Red Swingline Brochure",
        "pages_i":1,
        "content_t":"...",
        "_version_":1676585794196733952},
      {
        "id":"P11!D51",
        "name_s":"Quick Reference Guide",
        "pages_i":1,
        "content_t":"How to use your stapler ...",
        "_version_":1676585794196733952},
      {
        "id":"P22!D42",
        "name_s":"Red Mont Blanc Brochure",
        "pages_i":1,
        "content_t":"...",
        "_version_":1676585794347728896}]
  }}
----

We can wrap that query in a `{!parent}` query to return the details of all products that are ancestors of these manuals:

[source,bash]
----
$ curl 'http://localhost:8983/solr/gettingstarted/select' -d 'omitHeader=true' --data-urlencode 'q={!parent which="*:* -_nest_path_:*"}(+_nest_path_:\/skus\/manuals +pages_i:1)'
{
  "response":{"numFound":2,"start":0,"maxScore":1.4E-45,"numFoundExact":true,"docs":[
      {
        "id":"P11!prod",
        "name_s":"Swingline Stapler",
        "description_t":"The Cadillac of office staplers ...",
        "_version_":1676585794196733952},
      {
        "id":"P22!prod",
        "name_s":"Mont Blanc Fountain Pen",
        "description_t":"A Premium Writing Instrument ...",
        "_version_":1676585794347728896}]
  }}
----

In this example we've used `\*:* -\_nest_path_:*` as our <<other-parsers#block-mask,`which` parameter>> to indicate we want to consider all documents which don't have a nest path -- ie: all "root" level document -- as the set of possible parents.

By changing the `which` param to match ancestors at specific `\_nest_path_` levels, we can change the type of ancestors we return.  In the query below, we search for `skus` (using an `which` param that identifies all documents that do _not_ have a `\_nest_path_` with the prefix `/skus/*`) that are the ancestors of `manuals` with exactly `1` page:

[source,bash]
----
$ curl 'http://localhost:8983/solr/gettingstarted/select' -d 'omitHeader=true' --data-urlencode 'q={!parent which="*:* -_nest_path_:\\/skus\\/*"}(+_nest_path_:\/skus\/manuals +pages_i:1)'
{
  "response":{"numFound":2,"start":0,"maxScore":1.4E-45,"numFoundExact":true,"docs":[
      {
        "id":"P11!S21",
        "color_s":"RED",
        "price_i":42,
        "_version_":1676585794196733952},
      {
        "id":"P22!S22",
        "color_s":"RED",
        "price_i":89,
        "_version_":1676585794347728896}]
  }}
----

[CAUTION]
====
Note that in the above example, the `/` characters in the `\_nest_path_` were "double escaped" in the `which` parameter, for the <<#double-escaping-nest-path-slashes,same reasons discussed above>> regarding the `{!child} pasers `of` parameter.
====


=== Combining Block Join Query Parsers with Child Doc Transformer

The combination of these two parsers with the `[child] transformer enables seamless creation of very powerful queries.

Here for example is a query where:

* the (sku) documents returned must have a color of "RED"
* the (sku) docments returned must be the descendents of root level (product) documents which have:
** immediate child "manuals" documents which have:
*** "lifetime guarantee" in their content
* each return (sku) document also includes any descendent (manuals) documents it has

[source,bash]
----
$ curl 'http://localhost:8983/solr/gettingstarted/select' -d 'omitHeader=true' -d 'fq=color_s:RED' --data-urlencode 'q={!child of="*:* -_nest_path_:*" filters=$parent_fq}' --data-urlencode 'parent_fq={!parent which="*:* -_nest_path_:*"}(+_nest_path_:"/manuals" +content_t:"lifetime guarantee")' -d 'fl=*,[child]'
{
  "response":{"numFound":1,"start":0,"maxScore":1.4E-45,"numFoundExact":true,"docs":[
      {
        "id":"P11!S21",
        "color_s":"RED",
        "price_i":42,
        "_version_":1676585794196733952,
        "manuals":[
