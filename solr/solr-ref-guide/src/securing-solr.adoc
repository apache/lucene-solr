When planning how to secure Solr, you should consider which of the available features or approaches are right for you.

[WARNING]
====
No Solr API, including the Admin UI, is designed to be exposed to non-trusted parties. Tune your firewall so that only trusted computers and people are allowed access. Because of this, the project will not regard e.g., Admin UI XSS issues as security vulnerabilities. However, we still ask you to report such issues in JIRA.
====

=== Encryption with TLS (SSL) certificates

Ecrypting traffic to/from Solr and between Solr nodes prevents sensitive data to be leaked out on
the network. TLS is also normally a requirement to prevent credential sniffing when using Authentication.

See the page <<enabling-ssl.adoc#enabling-ssl,Enabling TLS (SSL)>> for details.

=== Authentication, Authorization and Audit logging

Plugins for authentication, authorization and audit logging are configured in the `security.json` configuration file,
and enabling any of these will immediately take effect across the whole cluster.

Read the chapter <<authentication-and-authorization-plugins.adoc#authentication-and-authorization-plugins,Configuring Authentication, Authorization and Auditlogging plugins>> to learn how to work with the `security.json` file.

[#securing-solr-auth-plugins]
==== Authentication plugins

Authentication makes sure you know the identity of your users. 

Supported authentication plugins are:

* <<kerberos-authentication-plugin.adoc#kerberos-authentication-plugin,Kerberos Authentication Plugin>>
* <<basic-authentication-plugin.adoc#basic-authentication-plugin,Basic Authentication Plugin>>
* <<hadoop-authentication-plugin.adoc#hadoop-authentication-plugin,Hadoop Authentication Plugin>>
* <<jwt-authentication-plugin.adoc#jwt-authentication-plugin,JWT Authentication Plugin>>

==== Authorization plugins

Authorization makes sure that only users with the necessary roles/permissions can access any given resource.
The authorization plugins shipping with Solr are:

* <<rule-based-authorization-plugin.adoc#rule-based-authorization-plugin,Rule-Based Authorization Plugin>>

==== Audit logging plugins

Audit logging will record an audit trail of important events in your cluster, such as users being authenticated,
or access being denied to admin APIs. Learn more about audit logging and how to implement an audit logger plugin here:

* <<audit-logging.adoc#audit-logging,Audit Logging Framework>>

=== Securing Zookeeper traffic

Zookeeper is a central and important part of a SolrCloud cluster and understanding how to secure
its content is covered in the <<zookeeper-access-control.adoc#zookeeper-access-control,ZooKeeper Access Control>> page.
