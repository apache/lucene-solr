[WARNING]
====
No Solr API, including the Admin UI, is designed to be exposed to non-trusted parties. Tune your firewall so that only trusted computers and people are allowed access. Because of this, the project will not regard e.g., Admin UI XSS issues as security vulnerabilities. However, we still ask you to report such issues in JIRA.
====

When planning how to secure Solr, you should consider which of the available features or approaches are right for you:

== Encryption with TLS (SSL) Certificates

Ecrypting traffic to/from Solr and between Solr nodes prevents sensitive data to be leaked out on the network. TLS is also normally a requirement to prevent credential sniffing when using Authentication.

See the page <<enabling-ssl.adoc#enabling-ssl,Enabling TLS (SSL)>> for details.

== Authentication, Authorization and Audit Logging

See chapter <<authentication-and-authorization-plugins.adoc#authentication-and-authorization-plugins,Configuring Authentication, Authorization and Audit Logging plugins>> to learn how to work with the `security.json` file.

[#securing-solr-auth-plugins]
=== Authentication Plugins

Authentication makes sure you know the identity of your users. The authentication plugins shipping with Solr are:

// tag::list-of-authentication-plugins[]
* <<kerberos-authentication-plugin.adoc#kerberos-authentication-plugin,Kerberos Authentication Plugin>>
* <<basic-authentication-plugin.adoc#basic-authentication-plugin,Basic Authentication Plugin>>
* <<hadoop-authentication-plugin.adoc#hadoop-authentication-plugin,Hadoop Authentication Plugin>>
* <<jwt-authentication-plugin.adoc#jwt-authentication-plugin,JWT Authentication Plugin>>
// end::list-of-authentication-plugins[]

=== Authorization Plugins

Authorization makes sure that only users with the necessary roles/permissions can access any given resource. The authorization plugins shipping with Solr are:

// tag::list-of-authorization-plugins[]
* <<rule-based-authorization-plugin.adoc#rule-based-authorization-plugin,Rule-Based Authorization Plugin>>
// end::list-of-authorization-plugins[]

=== Audit Logging Plugins

Audit logging will record an audit trail of incoming reqests to your cluster, such as users being denied access to admin APIs. Learn more about audit logging and how to implement an audit logger plugin here in the <<audit-logging.adoc#audit-logging,Audit Logging>> chapter.

== Request Logging

Solr can optionally log every incoming HTTP(s) request in the standard https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Log_Format[`NCSA format`]. You can enable request logging by setting `SOLR_REQUESTLOG_ENABLED=true` via environment variable or in `solr.in.sh`/`solr.in.cmd`.

== Enable IP Access Control

Restrict network access to specific hosts, by setting `SOLR_IP_WHITELIST`/`SOLR_IP_BLACKLIST` via environment variables or in `solr.in.sh`/`solr.in.cmd`.

[source,bash]
----
# Allow IPv4/IPv6 localhost, the 192.168.0.x IPv4 network, and 2000:123:4:5:: IPv6 network.
SOLR_IP_WHITELIST="127.0.0.1, [::1], 192.168.0.0/24, [2000:123:4:5::]/64"
# Explicitly deny access to two problematic hosts.
SOLR_IP_BLACKLIST="192.168.0.3, 192.168.0.4"
----

== Securing ZooKeeper Traffic

ZooKeeper is a central and important part of a SolrCloud cluster and understanding how to secure
its content is covered in the <<zookeeper-access-control.adoc#zookeeper-access-control,ZooKeeper Access Control>> page.

== Enable Security Manager

Solr can run in a Java Security Manager sandbox by setting `SOLR_SECURITY_MANAGER_ENABLED=true` via environment variable or in `solr.in.sh`/`solr.in.cmd`. This feature is incompatible with Hadoop.
