A collection alias is a virtual collection which Solr treats the same as a normal collection. The alias collection may point to one or more real collections.

Some use cases for collection aliasing:

* Time series data
* Reindexing content behind the scenes

[[createalias]]
== CREATEALIAS: Create or Modify an Alias for a Collection

The `CREATEALIAS` action will create a new alias pointing to one or more collections.
Aliases come in 2 flavors: standard and routed.

*Standard aliases* are simple:  CREATEALIAS registers the alias name with the names of one or more collections provided
  by the command.
If an existing alias exists, it is replaced/updated.
A standard alias can serve as a means to rename a collection, and can be used to atomically swap
which backing/underlying collection is "live" for various purposes.
When Solr searches an alias pointing to multiple collections, Solr will search all shards of all the collections as an
  aggregated whole.
While it is possible to send updates to an alias spanning multiple collections, standard aliases have no logic for
  distributing documents among the referenced collections so all updates will go to the first collection in the list.

`/admin/collections?action=CREATEALIAS&name=_name_&collections=_collectionlist_`

*Routed aliases* are aliases with additional capabilities to act as a kind of super-collection that route
  updates to the correct collection. Routing is data driven and may be based on a temporal field or on categories
  specified in a field (normally string based).
See <<aliases.adoc#routed-aliases,Routed Aliases>> for some important high-level information
  before getting started.

localhost:8983/solr/admin/collections?action=CREATEALIAS&name=timedata&router.start=NOW/DAY&router.field=evt_dt&router.name=time&router.interval=%2B1DAY&router.maxFutureMs=3600000&create-collection.collection.configName=myConfig&create-collection.numShards=2
----

If run on Jan 15, 2018, the above will create an time routed alias named timedata, that contains collections with names prefixed
with `timedata` and an initial collection named `timedata_2018_01_15` will be created immediately. Updates sent to this
alias with a (required) value in `evt_dt` that is before or after 2018-01-15 will be rejected, until the last 60
minutes of 2018-01-15. After 2018-01-15T23:00:00 documents for either 2018-01-15 or 2018-01-16 will be accepted.
As soon as the system receives a document for an allowable time window for which there is no collection it will
automatically create the next required collection (and potentially any intervening collections if `router.interval` is
smaller than `router.maxFutureMs`). Both the initial collection and any subsequent collections will be created using
the specified configset. All collection creation parameters other than `name` are allowed, prefixed
by `create-collection.`

This means that one could, for example, partition their collections by day, and within each daily collection route
the data to shards based on customer id. Such shards can be of any type (NRT, PULL or TLOG), and rule-based replica
placement strategies may also be used.

The values supplied in this command for collection creation will be retained
in alias properties, and can be verified by inspecting `aliases.json` in ZooKeeper.

NOTE: Presently only updates are routed and queries are distributed to all collections in the alias, but future
features may enable routing of the query to the single appropriate collection based on a special parameter or perhaps
a filter on the routed field.

=== CREATEALIAS Parameters

`name`::
The alias name to be created. This parameter is required. If the alias is to be routed it also functions
as a prefix for the names of the dependent collections that will be created. It must therefore adhere to normal
requirements for collection naming.

`async`::
Request ID to track this action which will be <<collections-api.adoc#asynchronous-calls,processed asynchronously>>.

==== Standard Alias Parameters

`collections`::
A comma-separated list of collections to be aliased. The collections must already exist in the cluster.
This parameter signals the creation of a standard alias. If it is present all routing parameters are
prohibited. If routing parameters are present this parameter is prohibited.

==== Routed Alias Parameters

Most routed alias parameters become _alias properties_ that can subsequently be inspected and <<aliasprop,modified>>.

`router.name`::
The type of routing to use. Presently only `time` and `category` and `Dimensional[]` are valid.
In the case of a multi dimensional routed alias (A. K. A. "DRA", see <<aliases.adoc#dimensional-routed-aliases,Aliases>>
documentation), it is required to express all the dimensions in the same order that they will appear in the dimension
array. The format for a DRA router.name is Dimensional[dim1,dim2] where dim1 and dim2 are valid router.name
values for each sub-dimension. Note that DRA's are very new, and only 2D DRA's are presently supported. Higher
numbers of dimensions will be supported soon. See examples below for further clarification on how to configure
individual dimensions. This parameter is required.

`router.field`::
The field to inspect to determine which underlying collection an incoming document should be routed to.
This field is required on all incoming documents.

`create-collection.*`::
The `*` wildcard can be replaced with any parameter from the <<collection-management.adoc#create,CREATE>> command except `name`. All other fields
are identical in requirements and naming except that we insist that the configset be explicitly specified.
The configset must be created beforehand, either uploaded or copied and modified.
It's probably a bad idea to use "data driven" mode as schema mutations might happen concurrently leading to errors.

==== Time Routed Alias Parameters

`router.start`::
The start date/time of data for this time routed alias in Solr's standard date/time format (i.e., ISO-8601 or "NOW"
optionally with <<working-with-dates.adoc#date-math,date math>>).
+
The first collection created for the alias will be internally named after this value.
If a document is submitted with an earlier value for router.field then the earliest collection the alias points to then
it will yield an error since it can't be routed. This date/time MUST NOT have a milliseconds component other than 0.
Particularly, this means `NOW` will fail 999 times out of 1000, though `NOW/SECOND`, `NOW/MINUTE`, etc. will work
just fine. This parameter is required.

`TZ`::
The timezone to be used when evaluating any date math in router.start or router.interval. This is equivalent to the
same parameter supplied to search queries, but understand in this case it's persisted with most of the other parameters
as an alias property.
+
If GMT-4 is supplied for this value then a document dated 2018-01-14T21:00:00:01.2345Z would be stored in the
myAlias_2018-01-15_01 collection (assuming an interval of +1HOUR).
+
The default timezone is UTC.

`router.interval`::
A date math expression that will be appended to a timestamp to determine the next collection in the series.
Any date math expression that can be evaluated if appended to a timestamp of the form 2018-01-15T16:17:18 will
work here.
+
This parameter is required.

`router.maxFutureMs`::
The maximum milliseconds into the future that a document is allowed to have in `router.field` for it to be accepted
without error.  If there was no limit, than an erroneous value could trigger many collections to be created.
+
The default is 10 minutes.

`router.preemptiveCreateMath`::
A date math expression that results in early creation of new collections.
+
If a document arrives with a timestamp that is after the end time of the most recent collection minus this
interval, then the next (and only the next) collection will be created asynchronously. Without this setting, collections are created
synchronously when required by the document time stamp and thus block the flow of documents until the collection
is created (possibly several seconds). Preemptive creation reduces these hiccups. If set to enough time (perhaps
an hour or more) then if there are problems creating a collection, this window of time might be enough to take
corrective action. However after a successful preemptive creation,  the collection is consuming resources without
being used, and new documents will tend to be routed through it only to be routed elsewhere. Also, note that
router.autoDeleteAge is currently evaluated relative to the date of a newly created collection, and so you may
want to increase the delete age by the preemptive window amount so that the oldest collection isn't deleted too
soon. Note that it has to be possible to subtract the interval specified from a date, so if prepending a
minus sign creates invalid date math, this will cause an error. Also note that a document that is itself
destined for a collection that does not exist will still trigger synchronous creation up to that destination collection
but will not trigger additional async preemptive creation. Only one type of collection creation can happen
per document.
Example: `90MINUTES`.
+
This property is blank by default indicating just-in-time, synchronous creation of new collections.

`router.autoDeleteAge`::
A date math expression that results in the oldest collections getting deleted automatically.
+
The date math is relative to the timestamp of a newly created collection (typically close to the current time),
and thus this must produce an earlier time via rounding and/or subtracting.
Collections to be deleted must have a time range that is entirely before the computed age.
Collections are considered for deletion immediately prior to new collections getting created.
Example: `/DAY-90DAYS`.
+
The default is not to delete.

==== Category Routed Alias Parameters

`router.maxCardinality`::
The maximum number of categories allowed for this alias.
This setting safeguards against the inadvertent creation of an infinite number of collections in the event of bad data.

`router.mustMatch`::
A regular expression that the value of the field specified by `router.field` must match before a corresponding
collection will be created. Note that changing this setting after data has been added will not alter the data already
indexed. Any valid Java regular expression pattern may be specified. This expression is pre-compiled at the start of
each request so batching of updates is strongly recommended. Overly complex patterns will produce cpu
or garbage collecting overhead during indexing as determined by the JVM's implementation of regular expressions.

==== Dimensional Routed Alias Parameters


`router.#.`::
This prefix denotes which position in the dimension array is being referred to for purposes of dimension configuration.
For example in a Dimensional[time,category] router.0.start would be used to set the start time for the time dimension.


=== CREATEALIAS Response

The output will simply be a responseHeader with details of the time it took to process the request.
To confirm the creation of the alias, you can look in the Solr Admin UI, under the Cloud section and find the
`aliases.json` file. The initial collection for routed aliases should also be visible in various parts of the admin UI.

=== Examples using CREATEALIAS
Create an alias named "testalias" and link it to the collections named "foo" and "bar".

[[aliasprop]]
== ALIASPROP: Modify Alias Properties for a Collection

The `ALIASPROP` action modifies the properties (metadata) on an alias. If a key is set with a value that is empty it will be removed.

`/admin/collections?action=ALIASPROP&name=_name_&property.someKey=somevalue`

WARNING: This command allows you to revise any property. No alias specific validation is performed.
         Routed aliases may cease to function, function incorrectly or cause errors if property values
         are set carelessly.

=== ALIASPROP Parameters

`name`::
The alias name on which to set properties. This parameter is required.

`property.*`::
The name of the property to be modified replaces '*', the value for the parameter is passed as the value for the property.

`async`::
Request ID to track this action which will be <<collections-api.adoc#asynchronous-calls,processed asynchronously>>.

=== ALIASPROP Response

The output will simply be a responseHeader with details of the time it took to process the request.
To confirm the creation of the property or properties, you can look in the Solr Admin UI, under the Cloud section and
find the `aliases.json` file or use the LISTALIASES api command.

=== Examples using ALIASPROP

*Input*

For an alias named "testalias2" and set the value "someValue" for a property of "someKey" and "otherValue" for "otherKey".
