The `<indexConfig>` section of `solrconfig.xml` defines low-level behavior of the Lucene index writers.

By default, the settings are commented out in the sample `solrconfig.xml` included with Solr, which means the defaults are used. In most cases, the defaults are fine.

== Writing New Segments

=== ramBufferSizeMB

Once accumulated document updates exceed this much memory space (defined in megabytes), then the pending updates are flushed. This can also create new segments or trigger a merge. Using this setting is generally preferable to `maxBufferedDocs`. If both `maxBufferedDocs` and `ramBufferSizeMB` are set in `solrconfig.xml`, then a flush will occur when either limit is reached. The default is 100Mb.

[source,xml]
----
<ramBufferSizeMB>100</ramBufferSizeMB>
----

=== maxBufferedDocs

Sets the number of document updates to buffer in memory before they are flushed as a new segment. This may also trigger a merge. The default Solr configuration sets to flush by RAM usage (`ramBufferSizeMB`).

[source,xml]
----
<maxBufferedDocs>1000</maxBufferedDocs>
----

=== useCompoundFile

Controls whether newly written (and not yet merged) index segments should use the <<Compound File Segments>> format. The default is false.

[source,xml]
----
<useCompoundFile>false</useCompoundFile>
----

=== ramPerThreadHardLimitMB

Sets the maximum memory (defined in megabytes) consumption per thread triggering a forced flush if exceeded. The given value must be greater than 0 and less than 2GB (2048 MB).

[source,xml]
----
<ramPerThreadHardLimitMB>1945</ramPerThreadHardLimitMB>
----

NOTE: This is an expert level parameter as it triggers forced flush even if <<ramBufferSizeMB>> has not been exceeded.

== Merging Index Segments

=== mergePolicyFactory

Defines how merging segments is done.

The default in Solr is to use a `TieredMergePolicy`, which merges segments of approximately equal size, subject to an allowed number of segments per tier.

Other policies available are the `LogByteSizeMergePolicy`, `LogDocMergePolicy`, and `UninvertDocValuesMergePolicy`. For more information on these policies, please see {lucene-javadocs}/core/org/apache/lucene/index/MergePolicy.html[the MergePolicy javadocs].

[source,xml]
----
<mergePolicyFactory class="org.apache.solr.index.TieredMergePolicyFactory">
  <int name="maxMergeAtOnce">10</int>
  <int name="segmentsPerTier">10</int>
  <double name="forceMergeDeletesPctAllowed">10.0</double>
  <double name="deletesPctAllowed">33.0</double>

</mergePolicyFactory>

=== Controlling Segment Sizes

The most common adjustment users make to the configuration of `TieredMergePolicy` (or `LogByteSizeMergePolicy`) are the "merge factors" to change how many segments should be merged at one time and, in the `TieredMergePolicy` case, the maximum size of an merged segment.

For `TieredMergePolicy`, this is controlled by setting the `maxMergeAtOnce` (default `10`), `segmentsPerTier` (default `10`) and `maxMergedSegmentMB` (default `5000`) options.

`LogByteSizeMergePolicy` has a single `mergeFactor` option (default `10`).

To understand why these options are important, consider what happens when an update is made to an index using `LogByteSizeMergePolicy`: Documents are always added to the most recently opened segment. When a segment fills up, a new segment is created and subsequent updates are placed there.

If creating a new segment would cause the number of lowest-level segments to exceed the `mergeFactor` value, then all those segments are merged together to form a single large segment. Thus, if the merge factor is `10`, each merge results in the creation of a single segment that is roughly ten times larger than each of its ten constituents. When there are 10 of these larger segments, then they in turn are merged into an even larger single segment. This process can continue indefinitely.

When using `TieredMergePolicy`, the process is the same, but instead of a single `mergeFactor` value, the `segmentsPerTier` setting is used as the threshold to decide if a merge should happen, and the `maxMergeAtOnce` setting determines how many segments should be included in the merge.

Choosing the best merge factors is generally a trade-off of indexing speed vs. searching speed. Having fewer segments in the index generally accelerates searches, because there are fewer places to look. It also can also result in fewer physical files on disk. But to keep the number of segments low, merges will occur more often, which can add load to the system and slow down updates to the index.

Conversely, keeping more segments can accelerate indexing, because merges happen less often, making an update is less likely to trigger a merge. But searches become more computationally expensive and will likely be slower, because search terms must be looked up in more index segments. Faster index updates also means shorter commit turnaround times, which means more timely search results.

=== Controlling Deleted Document Percentages

When a document is deleted or updated, the document is marked as deleted but it not removed from the index until the segment is merged. There are two parameters that can can be adjusted when using the default TieredMergePolicy that influence the number of deleted documents in an index.

* `forceMergeDeletesPctAllowed (default 10.0)`. When the external expungeDeletes command is issued, any segment that has more than this percent deleted documents will be merged into a new segment and the data associated with the deleted documents will be purged. A value of 0.0 will make expungeDeletes behave essentially identically to `optimize`.
* `deletesPctAllowed (default 33.0)`. During normal segment merging, a "best effort" is made to insure that the total percentage of deleted documents in the index is below this threshold.  Valid settings are between 20% and 50%. 33% was chosen as the default because as this setting approaches 20%, considerable load is added to the system.

=== Customizing Merge Policies

If the configuration options for the built-in merge policies do not fully suit your use case, you can customize them: either by creating a custom merge policy factory that you specify in your configuration, or by configuring a {solr-javadocs}/solr-core/org/apache/solr/index/WrapperMergePolicyFactory.html[merge policy wrapper] which uses a `wrapped.prefix` configuration option to control how the factory it wraps will be configured:

[source,xml]
----
<mergePolicyFactory class="org.apache.solr.index.SortingMergePolicyFactory">
  <str name="sort">timestamp desc</str>
  <str name="wrapped.prefix">inner</str>
  <str name="inner.class">org.apache.solr.index.TieredMergePolicyFactory</str>
  <int name="inner.maxMergeAtOnce">10</int>
  <int name="inner.segmentsPerTier">10</int>
</mergePolicyFactory>
----

The example above shows Solr's {solr-javadocs}/solr-core/org/apache/solr/index/SortingMergePolicyFactory.html[`SortingMergePolicyFactory`] being configured to sort documents in merged segments by `"timestamp desc"`, and wrapped around a `TieredMergePolicyFactory` configured to use the values `maxMergeAtOnce=10` and `segmentsPerTier=10` via the `inner` prefix defined by `SortingMergePolicyFactory` 's `wrapped.prefix` option. For more information on using `SortingMergePolicyFactory`, see <<common-query-parameters.adoc#segmentterminateearly-parameter,the segmentTerminateEarly parameter>>.

=== mergeScheduler

The merge scheduler controls how merges are performed. The default `ConcurrentMergeScheduler` performs merges in the background using separate threads. The alternative, `SerialMergeScheduler`, does not perform merges with separate threads.

The `ConcurrentMergeScheduler` has the following configurable attributes:

`maxMergeCount`::
The maximum number of simultaneous merges that are allowed. If a merge is necessary yet we already have this many threads running, the indexing thread will block until a merge thread has completed. Note that Solr will only run the smallest `maxThreadCount` merges at a time.

`maxThreadCount`::
The maximum number of simultaneous merge threads that should be running at once. This must be less than `maxMergeCount`.

`ioThrottle`::
A Boolean value (true/ false) to explicitly control I/O throttling. By default throttling is enabled and the CMS will limit I/O throughput when merging to leave other (search, indexing) some room.

The defaults for the above attributes are dynamically set based on whether the underlying disk drive is rotational disk or not. Refer to the <<taking-solr-to-production.adoc#dynamic-defaults-for-concurrentmergescheduler, Dynamic defaults for ConcurrentMergeScheduler>> section for more details.

----

=== mergedSegmentWarmer

When using Solr in for <<near-real-time-searching.adoc#near-real-time-searching,Near Real Time Searching>> a merged segment warmer can be configured to warm the reader on the newly merged segment, before the merge commits. This is not required for near real-time search, but will reduce search latency on opening a new near real-time reader after a merge completes.

== Compound File Segments

Each Lucene segment is typically comprised of a dozen or so files. Lucene can be configured to bundle all of the files for a segment into a single compound file using a file extension of `.cfs`; it's an abbreviation for Compound File Segment.

CFS segments may incur a minor performance hit for various reasons, depending on the runtime environment. For example, filesystem buffers are typically associated with open file descriptors, which may limit the total cache space available to each index.

On systems where the number of open files allowed per process is limited, CFS may avoid hitting that limit. The open files limit might also be tunable for your OS with the Linux/Unix `ulimit` command, or something similar for other operating systems.

.CFS: New Segments vs Merged Segments
[NOTE]
====
To configure whether _newly written segments_ should use CFS, see the <<useCompoundFile,`useCompoundFile`>> setting described above. To configure whether _merged segments_ use CFS, review the Javadocs for your <<mergePolicyFactory,`mergePolicyFactory`>>.

Many <<Merging Index Segments,Merge Policy>> implementations support `noCFSRatio` and `maxCFSSegmentSizeMB` settings with default values that prevent compound files from being used for large segments, but do use compound files for small segments.

== Index Locks

=== lockType

The LockFactory options specify the locking implementation to use.

The set of valid lock type options depends on the <<datadir-and-directoryfactory-in-solrconfig.adoc#datadir-and-directoryfactory-in-solrconfig,DirectoryFactory>> you have configured.

The values listed below are are supported by `StandardDirectoryFactory` (the default):

* `native` (default) uses NativeFSLockFactory to specify native OS file locking. If a second Solr process attempts to access the directory, it will fail. Do not use when multiple Solr web applications are attempting to share a single index. See also the {lucene-javadocs}core/org/apache/lucene/store/NativeFSLockFactory.html[Javadocs].
* `simple` uses SimpleFSLockFactory to specify a plain file for locking. See also the {lucene-javadocs}core/org/apache/lucene/store/SimpleFSLockFactory.html[Javadocs].
* `single` (expert) uses SingleInstanceLockFactory. Use for special situations of a read-only index directory, or when there is no possibility of more than one process trying to modify the index (even sequentially). This type will protect against multiple cores within the _same_ JVM attempting to access the same index. WARNING! If multiple Solr instances in different JVMs modify an index, this type will _not_ protect against index corruption. See also the {lucene-javadocs}core/org/apache/lucene/store/SingleInstanceLockFactory.html[Javadocs].
* `hdfs` uses HdfsLockFactory to support reading and writing index and transaction log files to a HDFS filesystem. See the section <<running-solr-on-hdfs.adoc#running-solr-on-hdfs,Running Solr on HDFS>> for more details on using this feature.

=== writeLockTimeout

The maximum time to wait for a write lock on an IndexWriter. The default is 1000, expressed in milliseconds.

----
<writeLockTimeout>1000</writeLockTimeout>
----

== Other Indexing Settings

There are a few other parameters that may be important to configure for your implementation. These settings affect how or when updates are made to an index.

`deletionPolicy`:: Controls how commits are retained in case of rollback. The default is `SolrDeletionPolicy`, which has sub-parameters for the maximum number of commits to keep (`maxCommitsToKeep`), the maximum number of optimized commits to keep (`maxOptimizedCommitsToKeep`), and the maximum age of any commit to keep (`maxCommitAge`), which supports `DateMathParser` syntax.

`infoStream`:: The InfoStream setting instructs the underlying Lucene classes to write detailed debug information from the indexing process as Solr log messages.


[source,xml]
----
<deletionPolicy class="solr.SolrDeletionPolicy">
  <str name="maxCommitsToKeep">1</str>
  <str name="maxOptimizedCommitsToKeep">0</str>
  <str name="maxCommitAge">1DAY</str>
</deletionPolicy>
<infoStream>false</infoStream>
