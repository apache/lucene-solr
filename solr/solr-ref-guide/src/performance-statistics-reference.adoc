This page explains some of the statistics that Solr exposes.

There are two approaches to retrieving metrics. First, you can use the <<metrics-reporting.adoc#metrics-api,Metrics API>>, or you can enable JMX and get metrics from the <<mbean-request-handler.adoc#mbean-request-handler,MBean Request Handler>> or via an external tool such as JConsole. The below descriptions focus on retrieving the metrics using the Metrics API, but the metric names are the same if using the MBean Request Handler or an external tool.

These statistics are per core. When you are running in SolrCloud mode these statistics would co-relate to the performance of an individual replica.

== Request Handler Statistics

=== Update Request Handler

The update request handler is an endpoint to send data to Solr. We can see how many update requests are being fired, how fast is it performing, and other valuable information regarding requests.

*Registry & Path:* `solr.<core>:UPDATE./update`

You can request update request handler statistics with an API request such as `\http://localhost:8983/solr/admin/metrics?group=core&prefix=UPDATE`.

=== Search Request Handler

Can be useful to measure and track number of search queries, response times, etc. If you are not using the “select” handler then the path needs to be changed appropriately. Similarly if you are using the “sql” handler or “export” handler, the realtime handler “get”, or any other handler similar statistics can be found for that as well.

*Registry & Path*: `solr.<core>:QUERY./select`

You can request statistics for the `/select` request handler with an API request such as `\http://localhost:8983/solr/admin/metrics?group=core&prefix=QUERY./select`.

=== Commonly Used Stats for Request Handlers
All of the update and search request handlers will provide the following statistics.

*Request Times*

To get request times, specifically, you can send an API request such as:

* `\http://localhost:8983/solr/admin/metrics?group=core&prefix=UPDATE./update.requestTimes`
*  `\http://localhost:8983/solr/admin/metrics?group=core&prefix=QUERY./select.requestTimes`

[cols="25,75",options="header"]
|===
|Attribute |Description
|15minRate |Requests per second received over the past 15 minutes.
|5minRate |Requests per second received over the past 5 minutes.
|p75_ms |Request processing time for the request which belongs to the 75^th^ Percentile. E.g., if 100 requests are received, then the 75^th^ fastest request time will be reported by this statistic.
|p95_ms |Request processing time in milliseconds for the request which belongs to the 95^th^ Percentile. E.g., if 100 requests are received, then the 95^th^ fastest request time will be reported in this statistic.
|p999_ms |Request processing time in milliseconds for the request which belongs to the 99.9^th^ Percentile. E.g., if 1000 requests are received, then the 999^th^ fastest request time will be reported in this statistic.
|p99_ms |Request processing time in milliseconds for the request which belongs to the 99^th^ Percentile. E.g., if 100 requests are received, then the 99^th^ fastest request time will be reported in this statistic.
|count |Total number of requests made since the Solr core was first created.
|median_ms |Median of all the request processing time.
|meanRate |Average number of requests received per second since the Solr core was first created.
|===

*Errors and Other Times*

Other types of data such as errors and timeouts are also provided. These are available under different metric names. For example:

* `\http://localhost:8983/solr/admin/metrics?group=core&prefix=UPDATE./update.errors`
*  `\http://localhost:8983/solr/admin/metrics?group=core&prefix=QUERY./select.errors`

The table below shows the metric names and attributes to request:

== Cache Statistics

=== Document Cache

This cache holds Lucene Document objects (the stored fields for each document). Since Lucene internal document IDs are transient, this cache cannot be auto-warmed.

*Registry and Path:* `solr.<core>:CACHE.searcher.documentCache`

You can get the statistics shown in the table below with an API request such as `\http://localhost:8983/solr/admin/metrics?group=core&prefix=CACHE.searcher.documentCache`.

=== Query Result Cache

This cache holds the results of previous searches: ordered lists of document IDs based on a query, a sort, and the range of documents requested

*Registry and Path:* `solr.<core>:CACHE.searcher.queryResultCache`

You can get the statistics shown in the table below with an API request such as `\http://localhost:8983/solr/admin/metrics?group=core&prefix=CACHE.searcher.queryResultCache`.

=== Filter Cache

This cache is used for filters for unordered sets of all documents that match a query.

*Registry and Path:* `solr.<core>:CACHE.searcher.filterCache`

You can get the statistics shown in the table below with an API request such as `\http://localhost:8983/solr/admin/metrics?group=core&prefix=CACHE.searcher.filterCache`.

=== Statistics for Caches

The following statistics are available for each of the caches mentioned above:
