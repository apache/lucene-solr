Streaming expressions provides a powerful set of functions for transforming result sets.
This section of the user guide provides an overview of useful transformations applied to result sets.

== Selecting and Adding Fields

The `select` function wraps another streaming expression can perform the following operations on each tuple
in the stream:

* *Select* a subset of fields
* *Map* fields to new names
* *Compute* new fields

Below is an example showing the `select` function wrapping a `search` function
and mapping fields to new field names. The `recNum` function is a math expression
which simply returns the current record number of the tuple. The `select` expression can call
any math expression to compute new values.

Below is an example using the `div` function to compute a new field
from two existing fields:

== Filtering Tuples

The `having` function can be used to filter tuples in the stream based on
boolean logic.

In the example below the `having` function is filtering the output of the
`facet` function to only emit tuples that have `count(*)` greater than 20404.

== Paging

The *record number*, added with the `recNum` function,
can be filtered on to support paging.

In the example below the `and` function with nested `lt` and `gt` functions are
used to select records within a specific record number range:

== Handling Nulls

The `notNull` and `isNull` functions can be used to either replace null values with different values,
or to filter out tuples with null values.

The example below is using the `isNull` function inside of `select` function
to replace null values with -1. The `if` function takes 3 parameters. The first
is a boolean expression, in this case `isNull`. The `if` function returns
the second parameter if the boolean function returns true, and the third
parameter if it returns false. In this case `isNull` is always true because its
checking for a field in the tuples that is not included in the result set.

`notNull` and `isNull` can also be used with the `having` function to filter out
tuples with null values.

The example below emits all the documents because it is evaluating `isNull` for
a field that is not in the result set, which always returns true.

The example below emits zero documents because it is evaluating `notNull` for
a field that is not in the result set, which always returns false.

== Regex Matching and Filtering

The `matches` function can be used inside of a `having` function
to test if a field in the record matches a specific
regular expression. This allows for sophisticated regex matching over search results.

The example below uses the `matches` function to return all records where
the `complaint_type_s` field ends with *Commercial*.

== Sorting

The `sort` and `top` function can be used to resort a result set in memory. The `sort` function
sorts and returns the entire result set based on the sort criteria. The `top` function
can be used to return the top N values in a result set based on the sort criteria.

== Rollups

The `rollup` and `hashRollup` functions can be used to perform aggregations over result sets. This
is different then the `facet`, `facet2D` and `timeseries` aggregation functions which push the aggregations
into the search engine using the JSON facet API.

The `rollup` function performs map-reduce style rollups, which requires the result stream be sorted by the
the grouping fields. This allows for aggregations over very high cardinality fields. The `hashRollup` function
performs rollups keeping all buckets in an in-memory hashmap. This requires enough memory to store all the
distinct group by fields in memory, but does not require that the underlying stream be sorted.

The example below shows a visualization of the top 5 complaint types
from a random sample of the `nyc311` complaint database. The `top`
function is used to select the top 5 complaint types based on
the `count(*)` field output by the `hashRollup`.
