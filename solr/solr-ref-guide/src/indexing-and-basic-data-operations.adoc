This section describes how Solr adds data to its index. It covers the following topics:

* *<<introduction-to-solr-indexing.adoc#introduction-to-solr-indexing,Introduction to Solr Indexing>>*: An overview of Solr's indexing process.

* *<<post-tool.adoc#post-tool,Post Tool>>*: Information about using `post.jar` to quickly upload some content to your system.

* *<<uploading-data-with-index-handlers.adoc#uploading-data-with-index-handlers,Uploading Data with Index Handlers>>*: Information about using Solr's Index Handlers to upload XML/XSLT, JSON and CSV data.

* *<<transforming-and-indexing-custom-json.adoc#transforming-and-indexing-custom-json,Transforming and Indexing Custom JSON>>*: Index any JSON of your choice

* *<<uploading-data-with-solr-cell-using-apache-tika.adoc#uploading-data-with-solr-cell-using-apache-tika,Uploading Data with Solr Cell using Apache Tika>>*: Information about using the Solr Cell framework to upload data for indexing.

* *<<uploading-structured-data-store-data-with-the-data-import-handler.adoc#uploading-structured-data-store-data-with-the-data-import-handler,Uploading Structured Data Store Data with the Data Import Handler>>*: Information about uploading and indexing data from a structured data store.

* *<<updating-parts-of-documents.adoc#updating-parts-of-documents,Updating Parts of Documents>>*: Information about how to use atomic updates and optimistic concurrency with Solr.

* *<<detecting-languages-during-indexing.adoc#detecting-languages-during-indexing,Detecting Languages During Indexing>>*: Information about using language identification during the indexing process.

* *<<de-duplication.adoc#de-duplication,De-Duplication>>*: Information about configuring Solr to mark duplicate documents as they are indexed.

* *<<content-streams.adoc#content-streams,Content Streams>>*: Information about streaming content to Solr Request Handlers.

* *<<uima-integration.adoc#uima-integration,UIMA Integration>>*: Information about integrating Solr with Apache's Unstructured Information Management Architecture (UIMA). UIMA lets you define custom pipelines of Analysis Engines that incrementally add metadata to your documents as annotations.

== Indexing Using Client APIs

Using client APIs, such as <<using-solrj.adoc#using-solrj,SolrJ>>, from your applications is an important option for updating Solr indexes. See the <<client-apis.adoc#client-apis,Client APIs>> section for more information.
