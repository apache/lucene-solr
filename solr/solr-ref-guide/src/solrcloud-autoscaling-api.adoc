The Autoscaling API is used to manage autoscaling policies, preferences, triggers, listeners and to get diagnostics on the state of the cluster.

== Read API

The autoscaling Read API is available at `/admin/autoscaling` or `/v2/cluster/autoscaling`. It returns information about the configured cluster preferences, cluster policy, collection-specific policies triggers and listeners.

This API does not take any parameters.

=== Read API Response

The output will contain cluster preferences, cluster policy and collection specific policies.

=== Examples using Read API

*Output*

[source,json]
----
{
    "responseHeader": {
        "status": 0,
        "QTime": 2
    },
    "cluster-policy": [
        {
            "replica": "<2",
            "shard": "#EACH",
            "node": "#ANY"
        }
    ],
    "WARNING": "This response format is experimental.  It is likely to change in the future."
}
----

== Diagnostics API

The diagnostics API shows the violations, if any, of all conditions in the cluster and, if applicable, the collection-specific policy. It is available at the `/admin/autoscaling/diagnostics` path.

This API does not take any parameters.

=== Diagnostics API Response

The output will contain `sortedNodes` which is a list of nodes in the cluster sorted according to overall load in descending order (as determined by the preferences) and `violations` which is a list of nodes along with the conditions that they violate.

=== Examples Using Diagnostics API

Here is an example with no violations but in the `sortedNodes` section, we can see that the first node is most loaded (according to number of cores):

[source,json]
----
{
    "responseHeader": {
        "status": 0,
        "QTime": 65
    },
    "diagnostics": {
        "sortedNodes": [
            {
                "node": "127.0.0.1:8983_solr",
                "cores": 3
            },
            {
                "node": "127.0.0.1:7574_solr",
                "cores": 2
            }
        ],
        "violations": []
    },
    "WARNING": "This response format is experimental.  It is likely to change in the future."
}
----

Suppose we added a condition to the cluster policy as follows:

[source,json]
----
{"replica": "<2", "shard": "#EACH", "node": "#ANY"}
----

However, since the first node in the first example had more than 1 replica for a shard already, then the diagnostics API will return:

[source,json]
----
{
    "responseHeader": {
        "status": 0,
        "QTime": 45
    },
    "diagnostics": {
        "sortedNodes": [
            {
                "node": "127.0.0.1:8983_solr",
                "cores": 3
            },
            {
                "node": "127.0.0.1:7574_solr",
                "cores": 2
            }
        ],
        "violations": [
            {
                "collection": "gettingstarted",
                "shard": "shard1",
                "node": "127.0.0.1:8983_solr",
                "tagKey": "127.0.0.1:8983_solr",
                "violation": {
                    "replica": "2",
                    "delta": 0
                },
                "clause": {
                    "replica": "<2",
                    "shard": "#EACH",
                    "node": "#ANY",
                    "collection": "gettingstarted"
                }
            }
        ]
    },
    "WARNING": "This response format is experimental.  It is likely to change in the future."
}
----

In the above example the node with port 8983 has two replicas for `shard1` in violation of our policy.

== Write API

The Write API is available at the same `/admin/autoscaling` and `/v2/cluster/autoscaling` endpoints as the read API but can only be used with the *POST* HTTP verb.

The payload of the POST request is a JSON message with commands to set and remove components. Multiple commands can be specified together in the payload. The commands are executed in the order specified and the changes are atomic, i.e., either all succeed or none.

=== Create and Modify Cluster Preferences

Cluster preferences are specified as a list of sort preferences. Multiple sorting preferences can be specified and they are applied in order.

They are defined using the `set-cluster-preferences` command.

Each preference is a JSON map having the following syntax:

`{'<sort_order>':'<sort_param>', 'precision':'<precision_val>'}`

See the section <<solrcloud-autoscaling-policy-preferences.adoc#cluster-preferences-specification,Cluster Preferences Specification>> for details about the allowed values for the `sort_order`, `sort_param` and `precision` parameters.

Changing the cluster preferences after the cluster is already built doesn't automatically reconfigure the cluster. However, all future cluster management operations will use the changed preferences.

*Input*

[source,json]
----
{
"set-cluster-preferences" : [
  {"minimize": "cores"}
  ]
}
----

*Output*

The output has a key named `result` which will return either `success` or `failure` depending on whether the command succeeded or failed.

[source,json]
----
{
    "responseHeader": {
        "status": 0,
        "QTime": 138
    },
    "result": "success",
    "WARNING": "This response format is experimental.  It is likely to change in the future."
}
----

==== Example Setting Cluster Preferences

In this example we add cluster preferences that sort on three different parameters:

[source,json]
----
{
  "set-cluster-preferences": [
    {
      "minimize": "cores",
      "precision": 2
    },
    {
      "maximize": "freedisk",
      "precision": 100
    },
    {
      "minimize": "sysLoadAvg",
      "precision": 10
    }
  ]
}
----

We can remove all cluster preferences by setting preferences to an empty list.
[source,json]
----
{
  "set-cluster-preferences": []
}
----

=== Create and Modify Cluster Policies

Cluster policies are set using the `set-cluster-policy` command.

Like `set-cluster-preferences`, the policy definition is a JSON map defining the desired attributes and values.

Refer to the <<solrcloud-autoscaling-policy-preferences.adoc#policy-specification,Policy Specification>> section for details of the allowed values for each condition in the policy.

*Input*:
[source,json]
----
{
"set-cluster-policy": [
  {"replica": "<2", "shard": "#EACH", "node": "#ANY"}
  ]
}
----

Output:
[source,json]
----
{
    "responseHeader": {
        "status": 0,
        "QTime": 47
    },
    "result": "success",
    "WARNING": "This response format is experimental.  It is likely to change in the future."
}
----

We can remove all cluster policy conditions by setting policy to an empty list.

[source,json]
----
{
  "set-cluster-policy": []
}
----

Changing the cluster policy after the cluster is already built doesn't automatically reconfigure the cluster. However, all future cluster management operations will use the changed cluster policy.

=== Create and Modify Collection-Specific Policy

The `set-policy` command accepts a map of policy names to the list of conditions for that policy. Multiple named policies can be specified together. A named policy that does not exist already is created and if the named policy accepts already then it is replaced.

Refer to the <<solrcloud-autoscaling-policy-preferences.adoc#policy-specification,Policy Specification>> section for details of the allowed values for each condition in the policy.

*Input*

[source,json]
----
{
"set-policy": {
  "policy1": [
    {"replica": "1", "shard": "#EACH", "port": "8983"}
    ]
  }
}
----

*Output*

[source,json]
----
{
    "responseHeader": {
        "status": 0,
        "QTime": 246
    },
    "result": "success",
    "WARNING": "This response format is experimental.  It is likely to change in the future."
}
----

Changing the policy after the collection is already built doesn't automatically reconfigure the collection. However, all future cluster management operations will use the changed policy.

=== Remove a Collection-Specific Policy

The `remove-policy` command accepts a policy name to be removed from Solr. The policy being removed must not be attached to any collection otherwise the command will fail.

*Input*
[source,json]
----
{"remove-policy": "policy1"}
----

*Output*
[source,json]
----
{
    "responseHeader": {
        "status": 0,
        "QTime": 42
    },
    "result": "success",
    "WARNING": "This response format is experimental.  It is likely to change in the future."
}
----

If you attempt to remove a policy that is being used by a collection, this command will fail to delete the policy until the collection itself is deleted.

== History API
History of autoscaling events is available at `/admin/autoscaling/history`. It returs information
about past autoscaling events and details about their processing. This history is kept in
the `.system` collection, and populated by a trigger listener `SystemLogListener` - by default this
listener is added to all new triggers.

History events are regular Solr documents so they can be also accessed directly by
searching on the `.system` collection. History handler acts as a regular search handler, so all
query parameters supported by `/select` handler for that collection are supported here too.
However, the history handler makes this
process easier by offering a simpler syntax and knowledge of field names
used by `SystemLogListener` for serialization of event data.

History documents contain also the action context, if it was available, which gives
further insight into eg. exact operations that were computed and/or executed.

Specifically, the following query parameters can be used (they are turned into
filter queries, so an implicit AND is applied):

* `trigger` - trigger name
* `eventType` - event type / trigger type (eg. `nodeAdded`)
* `collection` - collection name involved in event processing
* `stage` - event processing stage
* `action` - trigger action
* `node` - node name that the event refers to
* `beforeAction` - beforeAction stage
* `afterAction` - afterAction stage
