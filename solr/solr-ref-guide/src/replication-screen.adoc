The Replication screen shows you the current replication state for the core you have specified. <<solrcloud.adoc#,SolrCloud>> has supplanted much of this functionality, but if you are still using Leader-Follower index replication, you can use this screen to:

. View the replicatable index state. (on a leader node)
. View the current replication status (on a follower node)
. Disable replication. (on a leader node)

.Caution When Using SolrCloud
[IMPORTANT]
====
When using <<getting-started-with-solrcloud.adoc#,SolrCloud>>, do not attempt to disable replication via this screen.

More details on how to configure replication is available in the section called <<index-replication.adoc#,Index Replication>>.
