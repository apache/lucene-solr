You can install Solr in any system where a suitable Java Runtime Environment (JRE) is available, as detailed below.

Currently this includes Linux, MacOS/OS X, and Microsoft Windows.

== Installation Requirements

=== Java Requirements

You will need the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) version 1.8 or higher. At a command line, check your Java version like this:

[source,bash]
----
$ java -version
java version "1.8.0_60"
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_60-b27)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.60-b23, mixed mode)
----

The exact output will vary, but you need to make sure you meet the minimum version requirement. We also recommend choosing a version that is not end-of-life from its vendor. Oracle or OpenJDK are the most tested JREs and are recommended. It's also recommended to use the latest available official release when possible.

Some versions of Java VM have bugs that may impact your implementation. To be sure, check the page https://wiki.apache.org/lucene-java/JavaBugs[Lucene JavaBugs].

If you don't have the required version, or if the `java` command is not found, download and install the latest version from Oracle at http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html.

=== Supported Operating Systems

Solr is tested on several versions of Linux, MacOS, and Windows.
