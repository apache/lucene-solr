The goal of autoscaling is to make SolrCloud cluster management easier by providing a way for changes to the cluster to be more automatic and more intelligent.

Autoscaling includes an API to manage cluster-wide and collection-specific policies and preferences and a rules syntax to define the guidelines for your cluster. Also included are features to utilize the policies and preferences so they perform actions automatically when certain conditions are met.

The following sections describe the autoscaling features of SolrCloud:
