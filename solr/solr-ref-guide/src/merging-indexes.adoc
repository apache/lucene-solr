If you need to combine indexes from two different projects or from multiple servers previously used in a distributed configuration, you can use either the IndexMergeTool included in `lucene-misc` or the `CoreAdminHandler`.

To merge indexes, they must meet these requirements:

* The two indexes must be compatible: their schemas should include the same fields and they should analyze fields the same way.
* The indexes must not include duplicate data.

Optimally, the two indexes should be built using the same schema.

[[MergingIndexes-UsingIndexMergeTool]]
== Using `IndexMergeTool`

To merge the indexes, do the following:

. Make sure that both indexes you want to merge are closed.
. Issue this command:
+
[source,bash]
----
java -cp $SOLR/server/solr-webapp/webapp/WEB-INF/lib/lucene-core-VERSION.jar:$SOLR/server/solr-webapp/webapp/WEB-INF/lib/lucene-misc-VERSION.jar org/apache/lucene/misc/IndexMergeTool /path/to/newindex /path/to/old/index1 /path/to/old/index2
----
+
This will create a new index at `/path/to/newindex` that contains both index1 and index2.
. Copy this new directory to the location of your application's solr index (move the old one aside first, of course) and start Solr.

[[MergingIndexes-UsingCoreAdmin]]
== Using CoreAdmin

The `MERGEINDEXES` command of the <<coreadmin-api.adoc#CoreAdminAPI-MERGEINDEXES,CoreAdminHandler>> can be used to merge indexes into a new core â€“ either from one or more arbitrary `indexDir` directories or by merging from one or more existing `srcCore` core names.

See the <<coreadmin-api.adoc#CoreAdminAPI-MERGEINDEXES,CoreAdminHandler>> section for details.
