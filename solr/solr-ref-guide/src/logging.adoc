The Logging page shows recent messages logged by this Solr node.

When you click the link for "Logging", a page similar to the one below will be displayed:

.The Main Logging Screen, including an example of an error due to a bad document sent by a client
image::images/logging/logging.png[image,width=621,height=250]

While this example shows logged messages for only one core, if you have multiple cores in a single instance, they will each be listed, with the level for each.

== Selecting a Logging Level

When you select the *Level* link on the left, you see the hierarchy of classpaths and classnames for your instance. A row highlighted in yellow indicates that the class has logging capabilities. Click on a highlighted row, and a menu will appear to allow you to change the log level for that class. Characters in boldface indicate that the class will not be affected by level changes to root.
