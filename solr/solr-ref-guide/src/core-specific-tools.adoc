The Core-Specific tools are a group of UI screens that allow you to see core-level information.

In the left-hand navigation bar, you will see a pull-down menu titled "Core Selector". Clicking on the menu will show a list of Solr cores hosted on this Solr node, with a search box that can be used to find a specific core by name.

When you select a core from the pull-down, the main display of the page will show some basic metadata about the core, and a secondary menu will appear in the left nav with links to additional core specific administration screens.

The core-specific UI screens are listed below, with a link to the section of this guide to find out more:
