== Polynomial Curve Fitting


The `polyfit` function is a general purpose curve fitter used to model
the *non-linear* relationship between two random variables.

The `polyfit` function is passed *x* and *y* axises and fits a smooth curve to the data.
If only a single array is provided it is treated as the *y* axis and a sequence is generated
for the *x* axis.

The `polyfit` function also has a parameter the specifies the degree of the polynomial. The higher
the degree the more curves that can be modeled.

The example below uses the `polyfit` function to fit a curve to an array using
a 3 degree polynomial. The fitted curve is then subtracted from the original curve. The output
shows the error between the fitted curve and the original curve, known as the residuals.
The output also includes the sum-of-squares of the residuals which provides a measure
of how large the error is..

    residuals=ebeSubtract(y, curve),
    sumSqError=sumSq(residuals))

In the next example the curve is fit using a 5 degree polynomial. Notice that the curve
is fit closer, shown by the smaller residuals and lower value for the sum-of-squares of the
residuals. This is because the higher polynomial produced a closer fit.

=== Prediction, Derivatives and Integrals

The `polyfit` function returns a function that can be used with the `predict`
function.

In the example below the x axis is included for clarity.
The `polyfit` function returns a function for the fitted curve.
The `predict` function is then used to predict a value along the curve, in this
case the prediction is made for the *x* value of 5.

let(x=array(0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14),
    y=array(0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.7, 6, 7, 6, 5, 5, 3, 2, 1, 0),
    curve=polyfit(x, y, 5),
    p=predict(curve, 5))

        "RESPONSE_TIME": 0
      }
    ]

The `derivative` and `integrate` functions can be used to compute the derivative
and integrals for the fitted
curve. The example below demonstrates how to compute a derivative
for the fitted curve.

    curve=polyfit(x, y, 5),
    d=derivative(curve))

Like the `polyfit` function, the `gaussfit` function returns a function that can
be used directly by the `predict`, `derivative` and `integrate` functions.

The example below demonstrates how to compute an integral for a
fitted gaussian curve.

let(x=array(0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9, 10),
    y=array(4,55,1200,3028,12000,18422,13328,6426,1696,239,20),
