Solr includes a sample search UI based on the <<response-writers.adoc#velocity-writer,VelocityResponseWriter>> (also known as Solritas) that demonstrates several useful features, such as searching, faceting, highlighting, autocomplete, and geospatial searching.

When using the `sample_techproducts_configs` config set, you can access the Velocity sample Search UI: `\http://localhost:8983/solr/techproducts/browse`
