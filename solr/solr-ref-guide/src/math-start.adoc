== Language Notes

*Streaming Expressions* and *Math Expressions* are an expression language that runs
inside Solr Cloud. The language consists of function expressions that are designed
to be nested or *composed*. Streaming Expressions are purely functional in that they don't
have any constructs but functions. Math Expressions does have variables, so it's not
purely functional. But Math Expression variables are really just a special kind of
named parameter of the *let* expression.

*Streaming Expressions* all return streams of data. This allows Streaming Expressions to be
composed in ways that form a pipeline. A *Stream Source*, such as *search*, initiates
a stream of Tuples. A Stream Decorator, such as *select*, wraps the Stream Source and transforms
the stream of Tuples.

*Math Expressions* do not return streams of data. Math Expressions return primatives and in-memory
arrays and matrices. Many of the Math Expression are designed to work on arrays and matrices
to perform *statistical* and mathematical operations.

Streaming Expressions and Math Expressions can be combined to *search, sort,
sample, aggregate, transform, analyse* and *visualize* data in Solr Cloud collections.

== Executing Streaming Expressions and Math Expressions

Solr's /stream handler excuted Streaming Expressions and Math Expressions. The easiest way
run Streaming Expression and Math expressions is through *stream* panel on the Solr admin
UI.

A sample *search* Streaming Expression is shown is screensheet below:

A sample *add* Streaming Expression is shown is screensheet below:
