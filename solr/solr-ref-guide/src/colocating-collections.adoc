Solr provides a way to co-locate a collection with another so that cross-collection joins are always possible.

The co-location guarantee applies to all future Collection operations made either via Collections API or by Autoscaling
actions.

A collection may only be colocated with exactly one `withCollection`. However, arbitrarily many collections may be
_linked_ to the same `withCollection`.

== Create Collection using `withCollection`
The Create Collection API supports a parameter named `withCollection` which can be used to specify a collection
with which the replicas of the newly created collection should be co-located. See <<collections-api.adoc#create, Create Collection API>>

`/admin/collections?action=CREATE&name=techproducts&numShards=1&replicationFactor=2&withCollection=tech_categories`

In the above example, all replicas of the `techproducts` collection will be co-located on a node with at least one
replica of the `tech_categories` collection.

== Colocating existing collections
When collections already exist beforehand, the <<collections-api.adoc#modifycollection, Modify Collection API>> can be
used to set the `withCollection` parameter so that the two collections can be linked. This will *not* trigger
changes to the cluster automatically because moving a large number of replicas immediately might de-stabilize the system.
Instead, it is recommended that the Suggestions UI page should be consulted on the operations that can be performed
to change the cluster manually.

Example:
`/admin/collections?action=MODIFYCOLLECTION&collection=techproducts&withCollection=tech_categories`

== Deleting colocated collections
Deleting a collection which has been linked to another will fail unless the link itself is deleted first by using the
<<collections-api.adoc#modifycollection, Modify Collection API>> to un-set the `withCollection` attribute.

Example:
`/admin/collections?action=MODIFYCOLLECTION&collection=techproducts&withCollection=`

== Limitations and caveats

The collection being used as the `withCollection` must have one shard only and that shard should be named `shard1`. Note
that when using the default router, the shard name is always set to `shard1` but special care must be taken to name the
shard as `shard1` when using the implicit router.

In case new replicas of the `withCollection` have to be added to maintain the co-location guarantees then the new replicas
will be of type `NRT` only. Automatically creating replicas of `TLOG` or `PULL` types is not supported.

In case, replicas have to be moved from one node to another, perhaps in response to a node lost trigger, then the target
nodes will be chosen by preferring nodes that already have a replica of the `withCollection` so that the number of moves
is minimized. However, this also means that unless there are Autoscaling policy violations, Solr will continue to move
such replicas to already loaded nodes instead of preferring empty nodes. Therefore, it is advised to have policy rules
which can prevent such overloading by e.g. setting the maximum number of cores per node to a fixed value.

Example:
`{'cores' : '<8', 'node' : '#ANY'}`

The co-location guarantee is one-way only i.e. a collection 'X' co-located with 'Y' will always have one or more
replicas of 'Y' on any node that has a replica of 'X' but the reverse is not true. There may be nodes which have one or
more replicas of 'Y' but no replicas of 'X'. Such replicas of 'Y' will not be considered a violation of co-location
rules and will not be cleaned up automatically.
