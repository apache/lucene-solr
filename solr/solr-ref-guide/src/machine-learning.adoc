functions.

== Feature Scaling

Before performing machine learning operations its often necessary to
scale the feature vectors so they can be compared at the same scale.

All the scaling function operate on vectors and matrices.
When operating on a matrix the *rows* of the matrix are scaled.

=== Min/Max Scaling

The `minMaxScale` function scales a vector or matrix between a min and
max value. By default it will scale between 0 and 1 if min/max values
are not provided.

Below is a simple example of min/max scaling between 0 and 1.
Notice that once brought into the same scale the vectors are the same.

=== Standardization

The `standardize` function scales a vector so that it has a
mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. Standardization can be
used with machine learning algorithms, such as SVM, that
perform better when the data has a normal distribution.

=== Unit Vectors

The `unitize` function scales vectors to a magnitude of 1. A vector with a
magnitude of 1 is known as a unit vector.  Unit vectors are
preferred when the vector math deals
with vector direction rather than magnitude.

== Distance and Distance Measures

The `distance` function computes the distance for two
numeric arrays or a *distance matrix* for the columns of a matrix.

There are four distance measure functions that return a function
that performs the actual distance calculation:

* euclidean (default)
* manhattan
* canberra
* earthMovers
* haversineMeters (Geospatial distance measure)

The distance measure functions can be used with all machine learning functions
that support different distance measures.

Below is an example for computing euclidean distance for
two numeric arrays:

== K-means Clustering

The `kmeans` functions performs k-means clustering of the rows of a matrix.
Once the clustering has been completed there are a number of useful functions available
for examining the *clusters* and *centroids*.

The examples below are clustering *term vectors*.
The chapter on <<term-vectors.adoc#term-vectors,Text Analysis and Term Vectors>> should be
consulted for a full explanation of these features.

=== Centroid Features

In the example below the `kmeans` function is used to cluster a result set from the Enron email data-set
and then the top features are extracted from the cluster centroids.

Let's look at what data is assigned to each variable:

* *a*: The `random` function returns a sample of 500 documents from the *enron*
collection that match the query *body:oil*. The `select` function selects the *id* and
and annotates each tuple with the analyzed bigram terms from the body field.

* *b*: The `termVectors` function creates a TF-IDF term vector matrix from the
tuples stored in variable *a*. Each row in the matrix represents a document. The columns of the matrix
are the bigram terms that were attached to each tuple.
* *c*: The `kmeans` function clusters the rows of the matrix into 5 clusters. The k-means clustering is performed using the
*Euclidean distance* measure.
* *d*: The `getCentroids` function returns a matrix of cluster centroids. Each row in the matrix is a centroid
from one of the 5 clusters. The columns of the matrix are the same bigrams terms of the term vector matrix.
* *e*: The `topFeatures` function returns the column labels for the top 5 features of each centroid in the matrix.
This returns the top 5 bigram terms for each centroid.

=== Cluster Features

The example below examines the top features of a specific cluster. This example uses the same techniques
as the centroids example but the top features are extracted from a cluster rather then the centroids.

The `getCluster` function returns a cluster by its index. Each cluster is a matrix containing term vectors
that have been clustered together based on their features.

In the example below the `topFeatures` function is used to extract the top 4 features from each term vector
in the cluster.

== Multi K-means Clustering

K-means clustering will be produce different results depending on
the initial placement of the centroids. K-means is fast enough
that multiple trials can be performed and the best outcome selected.
The `multiKmeans` function runs the K-means
clustering algorithm for a gven number of trials and selects the
best result based on which trial produces the lowest intra-cluster
variance.

The example below is identical to centroids example except that
it uses `multiKmeans` with 100 trials, rather then a single
trial of the `kmeans` function.

== Fuzzy K-means Clustering

The `fuzzyKmeans` function is a soft clustering algorithm which
allows vectors to be assigned to more then one cluster. The *fuzziness* parameter
is a value between 1 and 2 that determines how fuzzy to make the cluster assignment.

After the clustering has been performed the `getMembershipMatrix` function can be called
on the clustering result to return a matrix describing which clusters each vector belongs to.
There is a row in the matrix for each vector that was clustered. There is a column in the matrix
for each cluster. The values in the columns are the probability that the vector belonged to the specific
cluster.

A simple example will make this more clear. In the example below 300 documents are analyzed and
then turned into a term vector matrix. Then the `fuzzyKmeans` function clusters the
term vectors into 12 clusters with a fuzziness factor of 1.25.

The `getMembershipMatrix` function is used to return the membership matrix and the first row
of membership matrix is retrieved with the `rowAt` function. The `precision` function is then applied to the first row
of the matrix to make it easier to read.

The output shows a single vector representing the cluster membership probabilities for the first
term vector. Notice that the term vector has the highest association with the 12th cluster,
but also has significant associations with the 3rd, 5th, 6th and 7th clusters.

== K-nearest Neighbor (KNN)

The `knn` function searches the rows of a matrix for the
K-nearest neighbors of a search vector. The `knn` function
returns a *matrix* of the K-nearest neighbors. The `knn` function
supports changing of the distance measure by providing one of the
four distance measure functions as the fourth parameter:

* euclidean (Default)
* manhattan
* canberra
* earthMovers

The example below builds on the clustering examples to demonstrate
the `knn` function.

In the example, the centroids matrix is set to variable *d*. The first
centroid vector is selected from the matrix with the `rowAt` function.
Then the `knn` function is used to find the 3 nearest neighbors
to the centroid vector in the term vector matrix (variable b).

The `knn` function returns a matrix with the 3 nearest neighbors based on the
default distance measure which is euclidean. Finally, the top 4 features
of the term vectors in the nearest neighbor matrix are returned.

== KNN Regression

KNN regression is a non-linear, multi-variate regression method. Knn regression is a lazy learning
technique which means it does not fit a model to the training set in advance. Instead the
entire training set of observations and outcomes are held in memory and predictions are made
by averaging the outcomes of the k-nearest neighbors.

The `knnRegress` function prepares the training set for use with the `predict` function.

Below is an example of the `knnRegress` function. In this example 10000 random samples
are taken each containing the variables *filesize_d*, *service_d* and *response_d*. The pairs of
*filesize_d* and *service_d* will be used to predict the value of *response_d*.

Notice that `knnRegress` returns a tuple describing the regression inputs.

    serviceLevels=col(samples, service_d),
    outcomes=col(samples, response_d),
    observations=transpose(matrix(filesizes, serviceLevels)),
    lazyModel=knnRegress(observations, outcomes , 5))

      {
        "EOF": true,
        "RESPONSE_TIME": 170
      }
    ]
  }
}

=== Prediction and Residuals

The output of `knnRegress` can be used with the `predict` function like other regression models.
In the example below the `predict` function is used to predict results for the original training
data. The sumSq of the residuals is then calculated.

let(samples=random(collection1, q="*:*", rows="10000", fl="filesize_d, service_d, response_d"),
    filesizes=col(samples, filesize_d),

    outcomes=col(samples, response_d),
    observations=transpose(matrix(filesizes, serviceLevels)),
    lazyModel=knnRegress(observations, outcomes , 5),
    predictions=predict(lazyModel, observations),
    residuals=ebeSubtract(outcomes, predictions),
    sumSqErr=sumSq(residuals))

      {
        "EOF": true,
        "RESPONSE_TIME": 3796
      }
    ]
  }
}

=== Setting Feature Scaling

If the features in the observation matrix are not in the same scale then the larger features
will carry more weight in the distance calculation then the smaller features. This can greatly
impact the accuracy of the prediction. The `knnRegress` function has a *scale* parameter which
can be set to *true* to automatically scale the features in the same range.

The example below shows `knnRegress` with feature scaling turned on.
Notice that when feature scaling is turned on the sumSqErr in the output is much lower.
This shows how much more accurate the predictions are when feature scaling is turned on in
this particular example. This is because the *filesize_d* feature is significantly larger then
the *service_d* feature.

    outcomes=col(samples, response_d),
    observations=transpose(matrix(filesizes, serviceLevels)),
    lazyModel=knnRegress(observations, outcomes , 5, scale=true),
    predictions=predict(lazyModel, observations),
    residuals=ebeSubtract(outcomes, predictions),
    sumSqErr=sumSq(residuals))

      },
      {
        "EOF": true,
        "RESPONSE_TIME": 3790
      }
    ]
  }
}
----


=== Setting Robust Regression

The default prediction approach is to take the *mean* of the outcomes of the k-nearest
neighbors. If the outcomes contain outliers the *mean* value can be skewed. Setting
the *robust* parameter to true will take the *median* outcome of the k-nearest neighbors.
This provides a regression prediction that is robust to outliers.


=== Setting the Distance Measure

The distance measure can be changed for the k-nearest neighbor search by adding a distance measure
function to the `knnRegress` parameters. Below is an example using manhattan distance.

let(samples=random(collection1, q="*:*", rows="10000", fl="filesize_d, service_d, response_d"),
    filesizes=col(samples, filesize_d),

    outcomes=col(samples, response_d),
    observations=transpose(matrix(filesizes, serviceLevels)),
    lazyModel=knnRegress(observations, outcomes, 5, manhattan(), scale=true),
    predictions=predict(lazyModel, observations),
    residuals=ebeSubtract(outcomes, predictions),
    sumSqErr=sumSq(residuals))
