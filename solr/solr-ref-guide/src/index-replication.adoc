Index Replication distributes complete copies of a primary index to one or more secondary servers. The primary server continues to manage updates to the index. All querying is handled by the secondaries. This division of labor enables Solr to scale to provide adequate responsiveness to queries against large search volumes.

The figure below shows a Solr configuration using index replication. The primary server's index is replicated on the secondaries.

.A Solr index can be replicated across multiple secondary servers, which then process requests.

== Index Replication in Solr

Solr includes a Java implementation of index replication that works over HTTP:

* The configuration affecting replication is controlled by a single file, `solrconfig.xml`
* Supports the replication of configuration files as well as index files
* Works across platforms with same configuration
* No reliance on OS-dependent file system features (e.g., hard links)
* Tightly integrated with Solr; an admin page offers fine-grained control of each aspect of replication
* The Java-based replication feature is implemented as a request handler. Configuring replication is therefore similar to any normal request handler.

.Replication In SolrCloud
[NOTE]
====
Although there is no explicit concept of "primary/secondary" nodes in a <<solrcloud.adoc#solrcloud,SolrCloud>> cluster, the `ReplicationHandler` discussed on this page is still used by SolrCloud as needed to support "shard recovery" – but this is done in a peer to peer manner.

When using SolrCloud, the `ReplicationHandler` must be available via the `/replication` path. Solr does this implicitly unless overridden explicitly in your `solrconfig.xml`, but if you wish to override the default behavior, make certain that you do not explicitly set any of the "primary" or "secondary" configuration options mentioned below, or they will interfere with normal SolrCloud operation.

== Replication Terminology

The table below defines the key terms associated with Solr replication.

Index::
A Lucene index is a directory of files. These files make up the searchable and returnable data of a Solr Core.

Distribution::
The copying of an index from the primary server to all secondaries. The distribution process takes advantage of Lucene's index file structure.

Inserts and Deletes::
As inserts and deletes occur in the index, the directory remains unchanged. Documents are always inserted into newly created segment files. Documents that are deleted are not removed from the segment files. They are flagged in the file, deletable, and are not removed from the segments until the segment is merged as part of normal index updates.

Primary and Secondary::
A Solr replication primary server is a single node which receives all updates initially and keeps everything organized. Solr replication secondary nodes receive no updates directly, instead all changes (such as inserts, updates, deletes, etc.) are made against the single primary node. Changes made on the primary server are distributed to all the secondary nodes which service all query requests from the clients.

Update::
An update is a single change request against a single Solr instance. It may be a request to delete a document, add a new document, change a document, delete all documents matching a query, etc. Updates are handled synchronously within an individual Solr instance.

Optimization::
A process that compacts the index and merges segments in order to improve query performance. Optimization should only be run on the primary nodes. An optimized index may give query performance gains compared to an index that has become fragmented over a period of time with many updates. Distributing an optimized index requires a much longer time than the distribution of new segments to an un-optimized index.

WARNING: optimizing is not recommended unless it can be performed regularly as it may lead to a significantly larger portion of the index consisting of deleted documents than would normally be the case.

Segments::
A self contained subset of an index consisting of some documents and data structures related to the inverted index of terms in those documents.

mergeFactor::
A parameter that controls the number of segments in an index. For example, when mergeFactor is set to 3, Solr will fill one segment with documents until the limit maxBufferedDocs is met, then it will start a new segment. When the number of segments specified by mergeFactor is reached (in this example, 3) then Solr will merge all the segments into a single index file, then begin writing new documents to a new segment.

Snapshot::
A directory containing hard links to the data files of an index. Snapshots are distributed from the primary nodes when the secondaries pull them, "smart copying" any segments the secondary node does not have in snapshot directory that contains the hard links to the most recent index data files.


== Configuring the ReplicationHandler

In addition to `ReplicationHandler` configuration options specific to the primary/secondary roles, there are a few special configuration options that are generally supported (even when using SolrCloud).

* `maxNumberOfBackups` an integer value dictating the maximum number of backups this node will keep on disk as it receives `backup` commands.
* Similar to most other request handlers in Solr you may configure a set of <<requesthandlers-and-searchcomponents-in-solrconfig.adoc#searchhandlers,defaults, invariants, and/or appends>> parameters corresponding with any request parameters supported by the `ReplicationHandler` when <<HTTP API Commands for the ReplicationHandler,processing commands>>.

=== Configuring the Replication RequestHandler on a Primary Server

Before running a replication, you should set the following parameters on initialization of the handler:

`replicateAfter`::
String specifying action after which replication should occur. Valid values are commit, optimize, or startup. There can be multiple values for this parameter. If you use "startup", you need to have a "commit" and/or "optimize" entry also if you want to trigger replication on future commits or optimizes.

`backupAfter`::
String specifying action after which a backup should occur. Valid values are commit, optimize, or startup. There can be multiple values for this parameter. It is not required for replication, it just makes a backup.

`maxNumberOfBackups`::
Integer specifying how many backups to keep. This can be used to delete all but the most recent N backups.

`confFiles`::
The configuration files to replicate, separated by a comma.

`commitReserveDuration`::
If your commits are very frequent and your network is slow, you can tweak this parameter to increase the amount of time expected to be required to transfer data. The default is `00:00:10` i.e., 10 seconds.

The example below shows a possible 'primary' configuration for the `ReplicationHandler`, including a fixed number of backups and an invariant setting for the `maxWriteMBPerSec` request parameter to prevent secondaries from saturating its network interface

[source,xml]
----
<requestHandler name="/replication" class="solr.ReplicationHandler">
  <lst name="primary">
    <str name="replicateAfter">optimize</str>
    <str name="backupAfter">optimize</str>
    <str name="confFiles">schema.xml,stopwords.txt,elevate.xml</str>
  </lst>
  <int name="maxNumberOfBackups">2</int>
  <str name="commitReserveDuration">00:00:10</str>
  <lst name="invariants">
    <str name="maxWriteMBPerSec">16</str>
  </lst>
</requestHandler>
----

==== Replicating solrconfig.xml

In the configuration file on the primary server, include a line like the following:

[source,xml]
----
<str name="confFiles">solrconfig_secondary.xml:solrconfig.xml,x.xml,y.xml</str>
----

This ensures that the local configuration `solrconfig_secondary.xml` will be saved as `solrconfig.xml` on the secondary server. All other files will be saved with their original names.

On the primary server, the file name of the secondary server configuration file can be anything, as long as the name is correctly identified in the `confFiles` string; then it will be saved as whatever file name appears after the colon ':'.

=== Configuring the Replication RequestHandler on a Secondary Server

The code below shows how to configure a ReplicationHandler on a secondary server.

[source,xml]
----
<requestHandler name="/replication" class="solr.ReplicationHandler">
  <lst name="secondary">

    <!-- fully qualified url for the replication handler of primary server. It is
         possible to pass on this as a request param for the fetchindex command -->
    <str name="primaryUrl">http://remote_host:port/solr/core_name/replication</str>

    <!-- Interval in which the secondary server should poll primary server.  Format is HH:mm:ss .
         If this is absent secondary server does not poll automatically.

         But a fetchindex can be triggered from the admin or the http API -->

    <str name="pollInterval">00:00:20</str>

    <!-- THE FOLLOWING PARAMETERS ARE USUALLY NOT REQUIRED-->

    <!-- To use compression while transferring the index files. The possible
         values are internal|external.  If the value is 'external' make sure
         that your primary Solr server has the settings to honor the accept-encoding header.
         If it is 'internal' everything will be taken care of automatically.
         USE THIS ONLY IF YOUR BANDWIDTH IS LOW.
         THIS CAN ACTUALLY SLOW DOWN REPLICATION IN A LAN -->
    <str name="compression">internal</str>

    <!-- The following values are used when the secondary server connects to the primary server to
         download the index files.  Default values implicitly set as 5000ms and
         10000ms respectively. The user DOES NOT need to specify these unless the
         bandwidth is extremely low or if there is an extremely high latency -->

    <str name="httpConnTimeout">5000</str>
    <str name="httpReadTimeout">10000</str>

    <!-- If HTTP Basic authentication is enabled on the primary server, then the secondary server
         can be configured with the following -->

    <str name="httpBasicAuthUser">username</str>
    <str name="httpBasicAuthPassword">password</str>
  </lst>
</requestHandler>
----

== Setting Up a Repeater with the ReplicationHandler

A primary server may be able to serve only so many secondaries without affecting performance. Some organizations have deployed secondary servers across multiple data centers. If each secondary server downloads the index from a remote data center, the resulting download may consume too much network bandwidth. To avoid performance degradation in cases like this, you can configure one or more secondaries as repeaters. A repeater is simply a node that acts as both a primary server and a secondary server.

* To configure a server as a repeater, the definition of the Replication `requestHandler` in the `solrconfig.xml` file must include file lists of use for both primaries and secondaries.
* Be sure to set the `replicateAfter` parameter to commit, even if `replicateAfter` is set to optimize on the main primary server. This is because on a repeater (or any secondary server), a commit is called only after the index is downloaded. The optimize command is never called on secondaries.
* Optionally, one can configure the repeater to fetch compressed files from the primary server through the compression parameter to reduce the index download time.

Here is an example of a ReplicationHandler configuration for a repeater:

[source,xml]
----
<requestHandler name="/replication" class="solr.ReplicationHandler">
  <lst name="primary">
    <str name="replicateAfter">commit</str>
    <str name="confFiles">schema.xml,stopwords.txt,synonyms.txt</str>
  </lst>
  <lst name="secondary">
    <str name="primaryUrl">http://primary.solr.company.com:8983/solr/core_name/replication</str>
    <str name="pollInterval">00:00:60</str>
  </lst>
</requestHandler>
----

== Commit and Optimize Operations

When a commit or optimize operation is performed on the primary server, the RequestHandler reads the list of file names which are associated with each commit point. This relies on the `replicateAfter` parameter in the configuration to decide which types of events should trigger replication.

These operations are supported:

* `commit`: Triggers replication whenever a commit is performed on the primary index.
* `optimize`: Triggers replication whenever the primary index is optimized.
* `startup`: Triggers replication whenever the primary index starts up.

The `replicateAfter` parameter can accept multiple arguments. For example:

[source,xml]
----
<str name="replicateAfter">startup</str>
<str name="replicateAfter">commit</str>
<str name="replicateAfter">optimize</str>
----

== Secondary Replication

The primary server is totally unaware of the secondaries.

The secondary server continuously keeps polling the primary server (depending on the `pollInterval` parameter) to check the current index version of the primary server. If the secondary server finds out that the primary server has a newer version of the index it initiates a replication process. The steps are as follows:

* The secondary server issues a `filelist` command to get the list of the files. This command returns the names of the files as well as some metadata (for example, size, a lastmodified timestamp, an alias if any).
* The secondary server checks with its own index if it has any of those files in the local index. It then runs the filecontent command to download the missing files. This uses a custom format (akin to the HTTP chunked encoding) to download the full content or a part of each file. If the connection breaks in between, the download resumes from the point it failed. At any point, the secondary server tries 5 times before giving up a replication altogether.
* The files are downloaded into a temp directory, so that if either the secondary server or the primary server crashes during the download process, no files will be corrupted. Instead, the current replication will simply abort.
* After the download completes, all the new files are moved to the live index directory and the file's timestamp is same as its counterpart on the primary.
* A commit command is issued on the secondary server by the Secondary's ReplicationHandler and the new index is loaded.

=== Replicating Configuration Files

To replicate configuration files, list them using using the `confFiles` parameter. Only files found in the `conf` directory of the primary's Solr instance will be replicated.

Solr replicates configuration files only when the index itself is replicated. That means even if a configuration file is changed on the primary, that file will be replicated only after there is a new commit/optimize on primary's index.

Unlike the index files, where the timestamp is good enough to figure out if they are identical, configuration files are compared against their checksum. The `schema.xml` files (on primary and secondary servers) are judged to be identical if their checksums are identical.

As a precaution when replicating configuration files, Solr copies configuration files to a temporary directory before moving them into their ultimate location in the conf directory. The old configuration files are then renamed and kept in the same `conf/` directory. The ReplicationHandler does not automatically clean up these old files.

If a replication involved downloading of at least one configuration file, the ReplicationHandler issues a core-reload command instead of a commit command.

=== Resolving Corruption Issues on Secondary Servers

If documents are added to the secondary server, then the secondary server is no longer in sync with its primary. However, the secondary server will not undertake any action to put itself in sync, until the primary has new index data.

When a commit operation takes place on the primary, the index version of the primary server becomes different from that of the secondary server. The secondary server then fetches the list of files and finds that some of the files present on the primary are also present in the local index but with different sizes and timestamps. This means that the primary and secondary server have incompatible indexes.

To correct this problem, the secondary server then copies all the index files from primary to a new index directory and asks the core to load the fresh index from the new directory.

== HTTP API Commands for the ReplicationHandler

You can use the HTTP commands below to control the ReplicationHandler's operations.

`enablereplication`::
Enable replication on the "primary" for all its secondaries.
+
[source,bash]
http://_primary_host:port_/solr/_core_name_/replication?command=enablereplication

`disablereplication`::
Disable replication on the primary for all its secondaries.
+
[source,bash]
http://_primary_host:port_/solr/_core_name_/replication?command=disablereplication

`indexversion`::
Return the version of the latest replicatable index on the specified primary or secondary server.
+
[source,bash]
http://_host:port_/solr/_core_name_/replication?command=indexversion

`fetchindex`::
Force the specified secondary server to fetch a copy of the index from its primary.
+
[source.bash]
http://_secondary_host:port_/solr/_core_name_/replication?command=fetchindex
+
If you like, you can pass an extra attribute such as `primaryUrl` or `compression` (or any other parameter which is specified in the `<lst name="secondary">` tag) to do a one time replication from a primary. This obviates the need for hard-coding the primary server location in the secondary server.

`abortfetch`::
Abort copying an index from a primary server to the specified secondary server.
+
[source,bash]
http://_secondary_host:port_/solr/_core_name_/replication?command=abortfetch

`enablepoll`::
Enable the specified secondary to poll for changes on the primary.
+
[source,bash]
http://_secondary_host:port_/solr/_core_name_/replication?command=enablepoll

`disablepoll`::
Disable the specified secondary server from polling for changes on the primary server.
+
[source,bash]
http://_secondary_host:port_/solr/_core_name_/replication?command=disablepoll

`details`::
Retrieve configuration details and current status.
+
[source,bash]
http://_secondary_host:port_/solr/_core_name_/replication?command=details

`filelist`::
Retrieve a list of Lucene files present in the specified host's index.
+
[source,bash]
http://_host:port_/solr/_core_name_/replication?command=filelist&generation=<_generation-number_>
+
You can discover the generation number of the index by running the `indexversion` command.

`backup`::
Create a backup on primary if there are committed index data in the server; otherwise, does nothing.
+
[source,bash]
http://_primary_host:port_/solr/_core_name_/replication?command=backup
+
This command is useful for making periodic backups. There are several supported request parameters:
+
* `numberToKeep:`: This can be used with the backup command unless the `maxNumberOfBackups` initialization parameter has been specified on the handler – in which case `maxNumberOfBackups` is always used and attempts to use the `numberToKeep` request parameter will cause an error.
* `name`: (optional) Backup name. The snapshot will be created in a directory called `snapshot.<name>` within the data directory of the core. By default the name is generated using date in `yyyyMMddHHmmssSSS` format. If `location` parameter is passed, that would be used instead of the data directory
* `repository`: The name of the backup repository to use. When not specified, it defaults to local file system.
* `location`: Backup location. Value depends on the repository in use. For file system repository, location defaults to core's dataDir, and if specified, it needs to be within `SOLR_HOME`, `SOLR_DATA_HOME` or the paths specified by solr.xml `allowPaths`.

`restore`::
Restore a backup from a backup repository.
+
[source,bash]
http://_primary_host:port_/solr/_core_name_/replication?command=restore
+
This command is used to restore a backup. There are several supported request parameters:
+
* `name`: (optional) Backup name. The name of the backed up index snapshot to be restored. If the name is not provided, it looks for backups with snapshot.<timestamp> format in the location directory. It picks the latest timestamp backup in that case.
* `repository`: The name of the backup repository where the backup resides. When not specified, it defaults to local file system.
* `location`: Backup location. Value depends on the repository in use. For file system repository, location defaults to core's dataDir, and if specified, it needs to be within `SOLR_HOME`, `SOLR_DATA_HOME` or the paths specified by solr.xml `allowPaths`.

`restorestatus`::
Check the status of a running restore operation.
+
[source,bash]
http://_primary_host:port_/solr/_core_name_/replication?command=restorestatus
+
This command is used to check the status of a restore operation. This command takes no parameters.
+
The status value can be "In Progress" , "success" or "failed". If it failed then an "exception" will also be sent in the response.

`deletebackup`::
Delete any backup created using the `backup` command.
+
[source,bash]
http://_primary_host:port_ /solr/_core_name_/replication?command=deletebackup
+
There are two supported parameters:

* `name`: The name of the snapshot. A snapshot with the name `snapshot._name_` must exist. If not, an error is thrown.
* `location`: Location where the snapshot is created.


== Distribution and Optimization

Optimizing an index is not something most users should generally worry about - but in particular users should be aware of the impacts of optimizing an index when using the `ReplicationHandler`.

The time required to optimize a primary index can vary dramatically. A small index may be optimized in minutes. A very large index may take hours. The variables include the size of the index and the speed of the hardware.

Distributing a newly optimized index may take only a few minutes or up to an hour or more, again depending on the size of the index and the performance capabilities of network connections and disks. During optimization the machine is under load and does not process queries very well. Given a schedule of updates being driven a few times an hour to the secondaries, we cannot run an optimize with every committed snapshot.

Copying an optimized index means that the *entire* index will need to be transferred during the next `snappull`. This is a large expense, but not nearly as huge as running the optimize everywhere.

Consider this example: on a three-secondary server one-primary server configuration, distributing a newly-optimized index takes approximately 80 seconds _total_. Rolling the change across a tier would require approximately ten minutes per machine (or machine group). If this optimize were rolled across the query tier, and if each secondary node being optimized were disabled and not receiving queries, a rollout would take at least twenty minutes and potentially as long as an hour and a half. Additionally, the files would need to be synchronized so that the _following_ the optimize, `snappull` would not think that the independently optimized files were different in any way. This would also leave the door open to independent corruption of indexes instead of each being a perfect copy of the primary.

Optimizing on the primary allows for a straight-forward optimization operation. No query secondaries need to be taken out of service. The optimized index can be distributed in the background as queries are being normally serviced. The optimization can occur at any time convenient to the application providing index updates.

While optimizing may have some benefits in some situations, a rapidly changing index will not retain those benefits for long, and since optimization is an intensive process, it may be better to consider other options, such as lowering the merge factor (discussed in the section on <<indexconfig-in-solrconfig.adoc#merge-factors,Index Configuration>>).

TIP: Do not elect to optimize your index unless you have tangible evidence that it will significantly improve your search performance. Recent changes in Solr/Lucene have dramatically lessened the need to optimize as discussed at the above link.
