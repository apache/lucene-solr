# Sample config file for RegexBoostProcessor
# This example applies boost on the "url" field to boost or deboost certain urls
# All rules are evaluated, and if several of them match, the boosts are multiplied.
# If for example one rule with boost 2.0 and one rule with boost 0.1 match, the resulting urlboost=0.2
