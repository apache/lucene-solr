/**
 * Default class to define circuit breakers for Solr.
 * <p>
 *  There are two (typical) ways to use circuit breakers:
 *  1. Have them checked at admission control by default (use CircuitBreakerManager for the same).
 *  2. Use the circuit breaker in a specific code path(s).
 *
 * TODO: This class should be grown as the scope of circuit breakers grow.
 *
 * The class and its derivatives raise a standard exception when a circuit breaker is triggered.
 * We should make it into a dedicated exception (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SOLR-14755)
