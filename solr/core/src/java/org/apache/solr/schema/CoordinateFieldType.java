/**
 * A CoordinateFieldType is the base class for {@link org.apache.solr.schema.FieldType}s that have semantics
 * related to items in a coordinate system.
 * <br>
 * Implementations depend on a delegating work to a sub {@link org.apache.solr.schema.FieldType}, specified by
 * either the {@link #SUB_FIELD_SUFFIX} or the {@link #SUB_FIELD_TYPE} (the latter is used if both are defined.
 * <br>
 * Example:
 * <pre>&lt;fieldType name="xy" class="solr.PointType" dimension="2" subFieldType="double"/&gt;
 * </pre>
 * In theory, classes deriving from this should be able to do things like represent a point, a polygon, a line, etc.
 * <br>
 * NOTE: There can only be one sub Field Type.
