 * <p>Components that implement this interface are always in one of two states:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>STOPPED - the default state. The component is idle and does not perform
 *   any functions. It should also avoid holding any resources.</li>
 *   <li>RUNNING - the component is active.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>Components must be prepared to change these states multiple times in their

 * <p>Implementation detail: currently these plugins are instantiated on all nodes
 * but they are started only on the Overseer leader, and stopped when the current
 * node loses its leadership.</p>
