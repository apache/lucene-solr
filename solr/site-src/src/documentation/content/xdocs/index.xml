      <title>What Is Solr?</title>

<p>
Solr is the popular, blazing fast open source enterprise search
platform from the Apache Lucene project.  Its major features include
powerful full-text search, hit highlighting, faceted search, dynamic
clustering, database integration, rich document (e.g., Word, PDF)
handling, and geospatial search.  Solr is highly scalable, providing distributed search and
index replication, and it powers the search and navigation features of
many of the world's largest internet sites.
</p>
<p>
Solr is written in Java and runs as a standalone full-text search server
within a servlet container such as <a href="http://tomcat.apache.org">Tomcat</a>.
Solr uses the <a href="http://lucene.apache.org/java/">Lucene Java</a>
search library at its core for full-text indexing and search, and has
REST-like HTTP/XML and JSON APIs that make it easy to use from virtually
any programming language.  Solr's powerful external configuration allows it to
be tailored to almost any type of application without Java coding, and
it has an extensive plugin architecture when more advanced
customization is required.
</p>

      <p>
        See the complete <a href="features.html">feature list</a> for more details.
      </p>

      <p>

        <section><title>26 October 2011 - Java 7u1 fixes index corruption and crash bugs in Apache Lucene Core and Apache Solr</title>
          <p>Oracle released <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/7u1-relnotes-507962.html">Java 7u1</a> on October 19.
          According to the release notes and tests done by the Lucene committers, all bugs reported on July 28 are fixed in this release,
          so code using Porter stemmer no longer crashes with <code>SIGSEGV</code>. We were not able to experience any index corruption anymore,
          so it is safe to use Java 7u1 with Lucene Core and Solr.</p>
          <p>On the same day, Oracle released <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/6u29-relnotes-507960.html">Java 6u29</a>
          fixing the same problems occurring with Java 6, if the JVM switches <code>-XX:+AggressiveOpts</code>
          or <code>-XX:+OptimizeStringConcat</code> were used. Of course, you should <strong>not</strong> use experimental JVM options like
          <code>-XX:+AggressiveOpts</code> in production environments! We recommend everybody to upgrade to this latest version 6u29.</p>
          <p>In case you upgrade to Java 7, remember that you may have to reindex, as the unicode
          version shipped with Java 7 changed and tokenization behaves differently
          (e.g. lowercasing). For more information, read <code>JRE_VERSION_MIGRATION.txt</code>

	<title>14 September 2011 - Solr 3.4.0 Released</title>
	<p>The Lucene PMC is pleased to announce the release of <a href="http://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.cgi/lucene/solr">Apache Solr 3.4.0</a>!
	</p> 
	<p>
	  Solr's version number was synced with Lucene following the Lucene/Solr merge, so Solr 3.4.0 contains Lucene 3.4.0.
	</p>
	<p>
	If you are already using Apache Solr 3.1, 3.2 or 3.3, we strongly recommend you upgrade to 3.4.0 because of the index corruption bug on OS or computer crash or power loss (<a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-3418">LUCENE-3418</a>), now fixed in 3.4.0.</p>

	<p>
	  Solr 3.4.0 release highlights include
	</p>
	<ul>
	  <li>Bug fixes and improvements from Apache Lucene 3.4.0, including a
	  major bug (<a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-3418">LUCENE-3418</a>) whereby a Lucene index could
	  easily become corrupted if the OS or computer crashed or lost
	  power.</li>

	  <li>SolrJ client can now parse grouped and range facets results
	  (<a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SOLR-2523">SOLR-2523</a>).</li>

	  <li>A new <code>XsltUpdateRequestHandler</code> allows posting XML that's
	  transformed by a provided XSLT into a valid Solr document
	  (<a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SOLR-2630">SOLR-2630</a>).</li>

	  <li>Post-group faceting option (<code>group.truncate</code>) can now compute
	  facet counts for only the highest ranking documents per-group.
	  (<a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SOLR-2665">SOLR-2665</a>).</li>

	  <li>Add <code>commitWithin</code> update request parameter to all update handlers
	  that were previously missing it.  This tells Solr to commit the
	  change within the specified amount of time (<a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SOLR-2540">SOLR-2540</a>).</li>

	  <li>You can now specify <code>NIOFSDirectory</code> (<a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SOLR-2670">SOLR-2670</a>).</li>

	  <li>New parameter <code>hl.phraseLimit</code> speeds up <code>FastVectorHighlighter</code>
	  (<a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-3234">LUCENE-3234</a>).</li>

	  <li>The query cache and filter cache can now be disabled per request.
	  See <a href="http://wiki.apache.org/solr/CommonQueryParameters#Caching_of_filters">this wiki page</a>
	  (<a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SOLR-2429">SOLR-2429</a>).</li>

	  <li> Improved memory usage, build time, and performance of 
	  <code>SynonymFilterFactory</code> (<a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-3233">LUCENE-3233</a>).</li>

	  <li> Added <code>omitPositions</code> to the schema, so you can omit position
	  information while still indexing term frequencies (<a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-2048">LUCENE-2048</a>).</li>

	  <li>Various fixes for multi-threaded <code>DataImportHandler</code>.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>See the <a href="http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/lucene/dev/tags/lucene_solr_3_4_0/solr/CHANGES.txt">release notes</a> for a more complete list of all the new features, improvements, and bugfixes.

<section><title>28 July 2011 - WARNING: Index corruption and crashes in Apache Lucene Core / Apache Solr with Java 7</title>
  <p>Oracle released <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/jdk7-relnotes-429209.html">Java 7</a> today.
  Unfortunately it contains hotspot compiler optimizations, which miscompile some loops.
  This can affect code of several Apache projects. Sometimes JVMs only crash, but in several cases,
  results calculated can be incorrect, leading to bugs in applications
  (see Hotspot bugs <a href="http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=7070134">7070134</a>,
  <a href="http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=7044738">7044738</a>,
  <a href="http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=7068051">7068051</a>).</p>
  <p><strong>Apache Lucene Core</strong> and <strong>Apache Solr</strong> are two Apache projects,
  which are affected by these bugs, namely all versions released until today.
  Solr users with the default configuration will have
  Java crashing with <code>SIGSEGV</code> as soon as they start to index documents, as one
  affected part is the well-known Porter stemmer
  (see <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-3335">LUCENE-3335</a>).
  Other loops in Lucene may be miscompiled, too, leading to index corruption
  (especially on Lucene trunk with pulsing codec; other loops may be
  affected, too - <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-3346">LUCENE-3346</a>).</p>
  <p>These problems were detected only 5 days before the official Java 7 release,
  so Oracle had no time to fix those bugs, affecting also many more applications.
  In response to our questions, they proposed to include the fixes into service
  release u2 (eventually into service release u1, see
  <a href="http://mail.openjdk.java.net/pipermail/hotspot-compiler-dev/2011-July/005971.html">this mail</a>).
  <strong>This means you cannot use Apache Lucene/Solr with Java 7 releases before Update 2!</strong>
  If you do, please don't open bug reports, it is not the committers' fault!
  At least disable loop optimizations using the <code>-XX:-UseLoopPredicate</code> JVM option
  to not risk index corruptions.</p>
  <p><em>Please note:</em> Also Java 6 users are affected, if they use one of those
  JVM options, which are <strong>not</strong> enabled by default: <code>-XX:+OptimizeStringConcat</code>
  or <code>-XX:+AggressiveOpts</code>.</p>
  <p>It is strongly recommended not to use any hotspot optimization switches in any Java
  version without extensive testing!</p>
  <p>In case you upgrade to Java 7, remember that you may have to reindex, as the unicode
  version shipped with Java 7 changed and tokenization behaves differently
  (e.g. lowercasing). For more information, read <code>JRE_VERSION_MIGRATION.txt</code>
  in your distribution package!</p>

   <title>20 August 2009 - Solr's first book is published!</title>
   <p>
   <a title="PACKT:Solr 1.4 Enterprise Search Server"

   David Smiley and Eric Pugh are proud to introduce the first book on Solr, <strong><a
href="http://www.packtpub.com/solr-1-4-enterprise-search-server?utm_source=http%3A%2F%2Flucene.apache.org%2Fsolr%2F&amp;utm_medium=spons&amp;utm_content=pod&amp;utm_campaign=mdb_000275">"Solr 1.4 Enterprise Search Server"</a></strong> from Packt Publishing.
   </p>
   <p>This book is a comprehensive reference guide for nearly every feature Solr has to offer. It serves the reader right from initiation to development to deployment. It also comes with complete running examples to demonstrate its use and show how to integrate it with other languages and frameworks.
   </p><p>To keep this interesting and realistic, it uses a large open source set of metadata about artists, releases, and tracks courtesy of the MusicBrainz.org project. Using this data as a testing ground for Solr, you will learn how to import this data in various ways from CSV to XML to database access. You will then learn how to search this data in a myriad of ways, including Solr's rich query syntax, &quot;boosting&quot; match scores based on record data and other means, about searching across multiple fields with different boosts, getting facets on the results, auto-complete user queries, spell-correcting searches, highlighting queried text in search results, and so on.
   </p><p>After this thorough tour, you'll see working examples of integrating a variety of technologies with Solr such as Java, JavaScript, Drupal, Ruby, PHP, and Python.
   </p><p>Finally, this book covers various deployment considerations to include indexing strategies and performance-oriented configuration that will enable you to scale Solr to meet the needs of a high-volume site.
