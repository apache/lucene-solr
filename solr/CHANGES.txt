                      Apache Solr Release Notes

Introduction
------------
Solr is the popular, blazing fast open source enterprise search platform from
the Apache Lucene project. Its major features include powerful full-text
search, hit highlighting, faceted search, dynamic clustering, database
integration, and rich document (e.g., Word, PDF) handling. Solr is highly
scalable, providing distributed search and index replication, and it powers the
search and navigation features of many of the world's largest internet sites.

Solr is written in Java and runs as a standalone full-text search server within
a servlet container such as Tomcat. Solr uses the Lucene Java search library at
its core for full-text indexing and search, and has REST-like HTTP/XML and JSON
APIs that make it easy to use from virtually any programming language. Solr's
powerful external configuration allows it to be tailored to almost any type of
application without Java coding, and it has an extensive plugin architecture
when more advanced customization is required. 

See README.txt and http://lucene.apache.org/solr for more information
on how to get started.

Upgrading from Solr 3.5
----------------------
* SOLR-2983: As a consequence of moving the code which sets a MergePolicy from SolrIndexWriter to SolrIndexConfig,
  (custom) MergePolicies should now have an empty constructor; thus an IndexWriter should not be passed as constructor
  parameter but instead set using the setIndexWriter() method.

* As doGet() methods in SimplePostTool was changed to static, the client applications of this
  class need to be recompiled.

* In Solr version 3.5 and earlier, HTMLStripCharFilter had known bugs in the
  character offsets it provided, triggering e.g. exceptions in highlighting.
  HTMLStripCharFilter has been re-implemented, addressing this and other
  issues.  See the entry for LUCENE-3690 in the Bug Fixes section below for a
  detailed list of changes.  For people who depend on the behavior of
  HTMLStripCharFilter in Solr version 3.5 and earlier: the old implementation
  (bugs and all) is preserved as LegacyHTMLStripCharFilter.

* As of Solr 3.6, the <indexDefaults> and <mainIndex> sections of solrconfig.xml are deprecated
  and replaced with a new <indexConfig> section. Read more in SOLR-1052 below.

* SOLR-3040: The DIH's admin UI (dataimport.jsp) now requires DIH request handlers to start with
  a '/'. (dsmiley)

* SOLR-3161: <requestDispatcher handleSelect="false"> is now the default. An existing config will
  probably work as-is because handleSelect was explicitly enabled in default configs. HandleSelect
  makes /select work as well as enables the 'qt' parameter. Instead, consider explicitly
  configuring /select as is done in the example solrconfig.xml, and register your other search
  handlers with a leading '/' which is a recommended practice.  (David Smiley, Erik Hatcher)

* SOLR-3161: Don't use the 'qt' parameter with a leading '/'.  It probably won't work in 4.0
  and it's now limited in 3.6 to SearchHandler subclasses that aren't lazy-loaded.

* SOLR-2724: Specifying <defaultSearchField> and <solrQueryParser defaultOperator="..."/> in
  schema.xml is now considered deprecated.  Instead you are encouraged to specify these via the "df"
  and "q.op" parameters in your request handler definition.  (David Smiley)

* Bugs found and fixed in the SignatureUpdateProcessor that previously caused 
  some documents to produce the same signature even when the configured fields 
  contained distinct (non-String) values.  Users of SignatureUpdateProcessor 
  are strongly advised that they should re-index as document signatures may 
  have now changed. (see SOLR-3200 & SOLR-3226 for details)

New Features
----------------------
* SOLR-2020: Add Java client that uses Apache Http Components http client (4.x).
  (Chantal Ackermann, Ryan McKinley, Yonik Seeley, siren)

* SOLR-2854: Now load URL content stream data (via stream.url) when called for during request handling,
  rather than loading URL content streams automatically regardless of use.
  (David Smiley and Ryan McKinley via ehatcher)

* SOLR-2904: BinaryUpdateRequestHandler should be able to accept multiple update requests from
  a stream (shalin)

* SOLR-1565: StreamingUpdateSolrServer supports RequestWriter API and therefore, javabin update
  format (shalin)
  
* SOLR-2438 added MultiTermAwareComponent to the various classes to allow automatic lowercasing
  for multiterm queries (wildcards, regex, prefix, range, etc). You can now optionally specify a
  "multiterm" analyzer in our schema.xml, but Solr should "do the right thing" if you don't
  specify <fieldType="multiterm"> (Pete Sturge Erick Erickson, Mentoring from Seeley and Muir)

* SOLR-2919: Added support for localized range queries when the analysis chain uses
  CollationKeyFilter or ICUCollationKeyFilter.  (Michael Sokolov, rmuir)

* SOLR-2982: Added BeiderMorseFilterFactory for Beider-Morse (BMPM) phonetic encoder. Upgrades
  commons-codec to version 1.6  (Brooke Schreier Ganz, rmuir)

* SOLR-1843: A new "rootName" attribute is now available when
  configuring <jmx/> in solrconfig.xml.  If this attribute is set,
  Solr will use it as the root name for all MBeans Solr exposes via
  JMX.  The default root name is "solr" followed by the core name.
  (Constantijn Visinescu, hossman)
  
* SOLR-2906: Added LFU cache options to Solr. (Shawn Heisey via Erick Erickson)

* SOLR-3036: Ability to specify overwrite=false on the URL for XML updates.
  (Sami Siren via yonik)

* SOLR-2603: Add the encoding function for alternate fields in highlighting.
  (Massimo Schiavon, koji)
  
* SOLR-1729: Evaluation of NOW for date math is done only once per request for
  consistency, and is also propagated to shards in distributed search.
  Adding a parameter NOW=<time_in_ms> to the request will override the
  current time.  (Peter Sturge, yonik, Simon Willnauer)
  
* SOLR-1709: Distributed support for Date and Numeric Range Faceting
  (Peter Sturge, David Smiley, hossman, Simon Willnauer)

* SOLR-3054, LUCENE-3671: Add TypeTokenFilterFactory that creates TypeTokenFilter
  that filters tokens based on their TypeAttribute.  (Tommaso Teofili via
  Uwe Schindler)

* LUCENE-3305, SOLR-3056: Added Kuromoji morphological analyzer for Japanese.
  See the 'text_ja' fieldtype in the example to get started.
  (Christian Moen, Masaru Hasegawa via Robert Muir)

* SOLR-1860: StopFilterFactory, CommonGramsFilterFactory, and 
  CommonGramsQueryFilterFactory can optionally read stopwords in Snowball
  format (specify format="snowball").  (Robert Muir)

* SOLR-3105: ElisionFilterFactory optionally allows the parameter 
  ignoreCase (default=false).  (Robert Muir)

* LUCENE-3714: Add WFSTLookupFactory, a suggester that uses a weighted FST
  for more fine-grained suggestions.  (Mike McCandless, Dawid Weiss, Robert Muir)

* SOLR-3143: Add SuggestQueryConverter, a QueryConverter intended for
  auto-suggesters. (Robert Muir)

* SOLR-3033: ReplicationHandler's backup command now supports a 'maxNumberOfBackups' 
  init param that can be used to delete all but the most recent N backups. (Torsten Krah, James Dyer)

* SOLR-2202: Currency FieldType, whith support for currencies and exchange rates
  (Greg Fodor & Andrew Morrison via janhoy, rmuir, Uwe Schindler)

* SOLR-3026: eDismax: Locking down which fields can be explicitly queried (user fields aka uf)
  (janhoy, hossmann, TomÃ¡s FernÃ¡ndez LÃ¶bbe)

* SOLR-2826: URLClassify Update Processor (janhoy)

* SOLR-2764: Create a NorwegianLightStemmer and NorwegianMinimalStemmer (janhoy)

* SOLR-3221: Added the ability to directly configure aspects of the concurrency
 and thread-pooling used within distributed search in solr. This allows for finer
 grained controlled and can be tuned by end users to target their own specific
 requirements. This builds on the work of the HttpCommComponent and uses the same configuration
 block to configure the thread pool. The default configuration has
 the same behaviour as solr 3.5, favouring throughput over latency. More
 information can be found on the wiki (http://wiki.apache.org/solr/SolrConfigXml) (Greg Bowyer)

* SOLR-2001: The query component will substitute an empty query that matches
  no documents if the query parser returns null.  This also prevents an
  exception from being thrown by the default parser if "q" is missing. (yonik)
  SOLR-435: if q is "" then it's also acceptable. (dsmiley, hoss)

Optimizations
----------------------
* SOLR-1931: Speedup for LukeRequestHandler and admin/schema browser. New parameter
  reportDocCount defaults to 'false'. Old behavior still possible by specifying this as 'true'
  (Erick Erickson)

* SOLR-3012: Move System.getProperty("type") in postData() to main() and add type argument so that
  the client applications of SimplePostTool can set content type via method argument. (koji)

* SOLR-2888: FSTSuggester refactoring: internal storage is now UTF-8, 
  external sorting (on disk) prevents OOMs even with large data sets
  (the bottleneck is now FST construction), code cleanups and API cleanups.
  (Dawid Weiss, Robert Muir)

Bug Fixes
----------------------
* SOLR-3187 SystemInfoHandler leaks filehandles (siren)

* LUCENE-3820: Fixed invalid position indexes by reimplementing PatternReplaceCharFilter.
  This change also drops real support for boundary characters -- all input is prebuffered
  for pattern matching. (Dawid Weiss)

* SOLR-3068: Fixed NPE in ThreadDumpHandler (siren)

* SOLR-2912: Fixed File descriptor leak in ShowFileRequestHandler (Michael Ryan, shalin)

* SOLR-2819: Improved speed of parsing hex entities in HTMLStripCharFilter
  (Bernhard Berger, hossman)
	 	   
* SOLR-2509: StringIndexOutOfBoundsException in the spellchecker collate when the term contains
  a hyphen. (Thomas Gambier caught the bug, Steffen Godskesen did the patch, via Erick Erickson)

* SOLR-2955: Fixed IllegalStateException when querying with group.sort=score desc in sharded
             environment. (Steffen Elberg Godskesen, Martijn van Groningen)

* SOLR-2956: Fixed inconsistencies in the flags (and flag key) reported by 
  the LukeRequestHandler (hossman)

* SOLR-1730: Made it clearer when a core failed to load as well as better logging when the
  QueryElevationComponent fails to properly initialize (gsingers)

* SOLR-1520: QueryElevationComponent now supports non-string ids (gsingers)

* SOLR-3024: Fixed JSONTestUtil.matchObj, in previous releases it was not 
  respecting the 'delta' arg (David Smiley via hossman)
  
* SOLR-2542: Fixed DIH Context variables which were broken for all scopes other 
  then SCOPE_ENTITY (Linbin Chen & Frank Wesemann via hossman)

* SOLR-3042: Fixed Maven Jetty plugin configuration. 
  (David Smiley via Steve Rowe)

* SOLR-2970: CSV ResponseWriter returns fields defined as stored=false in schema (janhoy)

* LUCENE-3690, LUCENE-2208, SOLR-882, SOLR-42: Re-implemented
  HTMLStripCharFilter as a JFlex-generated scanner and moved it to
  lucene/contrib/analyzers/common/.  See below for a list of bug fixes and
  other changes.  To get the same behavior as HTMLStripCharFilter in Solr
  version 3.5 and earlier (including the bugs), use LegacyHTMLStripCharFilter,
  which is the previous implementation.

  Behavior changes from the previous version:

  - Known offset bugs are fixed.
  - The "Mark invalid" exceptions reported in SOLR-1283 are no longer
    triggered (the bug is still present in LegacyHTMLStripCharFilter).
  - The character entity "&apos;" is now always properly decoded.
  - More cases of <script> tags are now properly stripped.
  - CDATA sections are now handled properly.
  - Valid tag name characters now include the supplementary Unicode characters
    from Unicode character classes [:ID_Start:] and [:ID_Continue:].
  - Uppercase character entities "&QUOT;", "&COPY;", "&GT;", "&LT;", "&REG;",
    and "&AMP;" are now recognized and handled as if they were in lowercase.
  - The REPLACEMENT CHARACTER U+FFFD is now used to replace numeric character
    entities for unpaired UTF-16 low and high surrogates (in the range
    [U+D800-U+DFFF]).
  - Properly paired numeric character entities for UTF-16 surrogates are now
    converted to the corresponding code units.
  - Opening tags with unbalanced quotation marks are now properly stripped.
  - Literal "<" and ">" characters in opening tags, regardless of whether they
    appear inside quotation marks, now inhibit recognition (and stripping) of
    the tags.  The only exception to this is for values of event-handler
    attributes, e.g. "onClick", "onLoad", "onSelect".
  - A newline '\n' is substituted instead of a space for stripped HTML markup.
  - Nothing is substituted for opening and closing inline tags - they are
    simply removed.  The list of inline tags is (case insensitively): <a>,
    <abbr>, <acronym>, <b>, <basefont>, <bdo>, <big>, <cite>, <code>, <dfn>,
    <em>, <font>, <i>, <img>, <input>, <kbd>, <label>, <q>, <s>, <samp>,
    <select>, <small>, <span>, <strike>, <strong>, <sub>, <sup>, <textarea>,
    <tt>, <u>, and <var>.
  - HTMLStripCharFilterFactory now handles HTMLStripCharFilter's "escapedTags"
    feature: opening and closing tags with the given names, including any
    attributes and their values, are left intact in the output.
  (Steve Rowe)

* LUCENE-3717: Fixed offset bugs in TrimFilter, WordDelimiterFilter, and
  HyphenatedWordsFilter where they would create invalid offsets in
  some situations, leading to problems in highlighting.  (Robert Muir)

* SOLR-2280: commitWithin ignored for a delete query (Juan Grande via janhoy)

* SOLR-3073: Fixed 'Invalid UUID string' error when having an UUID field as
  the unique key and executing a distributed grouping request. (Devon Krisman, Martijn van Groningen)

* SOLR-3084: Fixed initialization error when using 
  <queryResponseWriter default="true" ... /> (Bernd Fehling and hossman)

* SOLR-3109: Fixed numerous redundant shard requests when using distributed grouping.
  (rblack via Martijn van Groningen)

* SOLR-3052: Fixed typo in distributed grouping parameters.
  (Martijn van Groningen, Grant Ingersoll)

* SOLR-2909: Add support for ResourceLoaderAware tokenizerFactories in synonym
  filter factories. (Tom Klonikowski, Jun Ohtani via Koji Sekiguchi)
  
* SOLR-3168: ReplicationHandler "numberToKeep" & "maxNumberOfBackups" parameters
  would keep only 1 backup, even if more than 1 was specified (Neil Hooey, James Dyer)

* SOLR-3009: hitGrouped.vm isn't shipped with 3.x (ehatcher, janhoy)

* SOLR-3195: timeAllowed is ignored for grouping queries
  (Russell Black via Martijn van Groningen)

* SOLR-2124: Do not log stack traces for "Service Disabled" / 503 Exceptions (PingRequestHandler, etc)
  (James Dyer, others)
  
* SOLR-3260: DataImportHandler: ScriptTransformer gives better error messages when 
  problems arise on initalization (no Script Engine, invalid script, etc). (James Dyer)

* SOLR-2959: edismax now respects the magic fields '_val_' and '_query_'
  (Michael Watts, hossman)

* SOLR-3074: fix SolrPluginUtils.docListToSolrDocumentList to respect the 
  list of fields specified.  This fix also deprecates 
  DocumentBuilder.loadStoredFields which is not used anywhere in Solr, 
  and was fundamentally broken/bizarre.
  (hossman, Ahmet Arslan)

* SOLR-2291: fix JSONWriter to respect field list when writing SolrDocuments
  (Ahmet Arslan via hossman)

* SOLR-3264: Fix CoreContainer and SolrResourceLoader logging to be more 
  clear about when SolrCores are being created, and stop misleading people 
  about SolrCore instanceDir's being the "Solr Home Dir" (hossman)

* SOLR-3046: Fix whitespace typo in DIH response "Time taken" (hossman)

* SOLR-3261: Fix edismax to respect query operators when literal colons 
  are used in query string.  (Juan Grande via hossman)

* SOLR-3226: Fix SignatureUpdateProcessor to no longer ignore non-String 
  field values (Spyros Kapnissis, hossman)

* SOLR-3200: Fix SignatureUpdateProcessor "all fields" mode to use all 
  fields of each document instead of the fields specified by the first 
  document indexed (Spyros Kapnissis via hossman)
  
* SOLR-3316: Distributed grouping failed when rows parameter was set to 0 and 
  sometimes returned a wrong hit count as matches. (Cody Young, Martijn van Groningen)

Other Changes
----------------------
* SOLR-2922: Upgrade commons-io and commons-lang to 2.1 and 2.6, respectively. (koji)

* SOLR-2920: Refactor frequent conditional use of DefaultSolrParams and 
  AppendedSolrParams into factory methods.
  (David Smiley via hossman)
  
* SOLR-3032: Deprecate logOnce from SolrException logOnce and all the supporting
  structure will disappear in 4.0. Errors should be caught and logged at the
  top-most level or logged and NOT propagated up the chain. (Erick Erickson)

* SOLR-2718: Add ability to lazy load response writers, defined with startup="lazy".
  (ehatcher)

* SOLR-2901: Upgrade Solr to Tika 1.0 (janhoy)

* SOLR-3059: Example XSL stylesheet for indexing query result XML (janhoy)

* SOLR-3097, SOLR-3105: Add analysis configurations for different languages to 
  the example.  (Christian Moen, Robert Muir)

* SOLR-3005: Default QueryResponseWriters are now initialized via init() with an empty
  NamedList. (Gasol Wu, Chris Male)

* SOLR-3140: Upgrade schema version to 1.5, where omitNorms defaults to "true" for all
  primitive (non-analyzed) field types such as int, float, date, bool, string.. (janhoy)

* SOLR-3077: Better error messages when attempting to use "blank" field names 
  (Antony Stubbs via hossman)

* SOLR-2712: expecting fl=score to return all fields is now deprecated.  
  In solr 4.0, this will only return the score.  (ryan)

* SOLR-3156: Check for Lucene directory locks at startup. In previous versions
  this check was only performed during modifying (e.g. adding and deleting
  documents) the index. (Luca Cavanna via Martijn van Groningen)

* SOLR-1052: Deprecated <indexDefaults> and <mainIndex> in solrconfig.xml
  From now, all settings go in the new <indexConfig> tag, and some defaults are
  changed: useCompoundFile=false, ramBufferSizeMB=32, lockType=native, so that
  the effect of NOT specifying <indexConfig> at all gives same result as the
  example config used to give in 3.5 (janhoy, gsingers)

* SOLR-3294: In contrib/clustering/lib/, replaced the manually retrowoven
  Java 1.5-compatible carrot2-core-3.5.0.jar (which is not publicly available,
  except from the Solr Subversion repository), with newly released Java
  1.5-compatible carrot2-core-3.5.0.1.jar (hosted on the Maven Central
  repository).  Also updated dependencies jackson-core-asl and
  jackson-mapper-asl (both v1.5.2 -> v1.7.4).  (Dawid Weiss, Steve Rowe)

Build
----------------------
* SOLR-2487: Add build target to package war without slf4j jars (janhoy)

* SOLR-3112: Fix tests not to write to src/test-files (Luca Cavanna via Robert Muir)

* LUCENE-3753: Restructure the Solr build system. (Steve Rowe)

* SOLR-3204: The packaged pre-release artifact of Commons CSV used the original
  package name (org.apache.commons.csv). This created a compatibility issue as
  the Apache Commons team works toward an official release of Commons CSV.
  The source of Commons CSV was added under a separate package name to the
  Solr source code.  (Uwe Schindler, Chris Male, Emmanuel Bourg)  
 
* LUCENE-3930: Changed build system to use Apache Ivy for retrival of 3rd
  party JAR files.  Please review README.txt for instructions.
  (Robert Muir, Chris Male, Uwe Schindler, Steven Rowe, Hossman)

----------------------

* SOLR-2762: (backport form 4.x line): FSTLookup could return duplicate 
  results or one results less than requested. (David Smiley, Dawid Weiss)

* SOLR-2748: The CommitTracker used for commitWith or autoCommit by maxTime
  could commit too frequently and could block adds until a new searcher was
  registered. (yonik)

* SOLR-2726: Fixed NullPointerException when using spellcheck.q with Suggester.
  (Bernd Fehling, valentin via rmuir)

* SOLR-2772: Fixed Date parsing/formatting of years 0001-1000 (hossman)

* SOLR-2763: Extracting update request handler throws exception and returns 400

  QueryElevationComponent fails to properly initialize (gsingers)

* k
  (Russell Black via Martijn van Groningen)

 Other Changes
----------------------

* SOLR-2750: Make both "update.chain" and the deprecated "update.param" work
  consistently everywhere; see also SOLR-2105. (Mark Miller, janhoy)

* LUCENE-3410: Deprecated the WordDelimiterFilter constructors accepting multiple
  ints masquerading as booleans.  Preferred constructor now accepts a single int
  bitfield (Chris Male)

  org.codehaus.woodstox:wstx-asl dependency. (David Smiley, Steve Rowe)
  
* SOLR-2770: 'ant generate-maven-artifacts' should generate the maven
  artifact for the Solr-specific jdk15-compiled carrot2-core dependency.
  (Steve Rowe)

* SOLR-2766: Package individual javadoc sites for solrj and test-framework.
  (Steve Rowe, Mike McCandless)

* SOLR-2771: Solr modules' tests should not depend on solr-core test classes;

* SOLR-1123: Changed JSONResponseWriter to now use application/json as its Content-Type
  by default.  However the Content-Type can be overwritten and is set to text/plain in
  the example configuration. (Uri Boness, Chris Male)
  
==================  3.4.0  ==================

Upgrading from Solr 3.3
----------------------

* The Lucene index format has changed and as a result, once you upgrade,
  previous versions of Solr will no longer be able to read your indices.
  In a master/slave configuration, all searchers/slaves should be upgraded
  before the master.  If the master were to be updated first, the older
  searchers would not be able to read the new index format.

* Previous versions of Solr silently allow and ignore some contradictory 
  properties specified in schema.xml.  For example:
    - indexed="false" omitNorms="false" 
    - indexed="false" omitTermFreqAndPositions="false"
  Field property validation has now been fixed, to ensure that
  contradictions like these now generate error messages.  If users
  have existing schemas that generate one of these new "conflicting
  'false' field options for non-indexed field" error messages the
  conflicting "omit*" properties can safely be removed, or changed to
  "true" for consistent behavior with previous Solr versions.  This
  situation has now been fixed to cause an error on startup when these
  contradictory options.  See SOLR-2669.
  
* FacetComponent no longer catches and embeds exceptions occurred during facet
  processing, it throws HTTP 400 or 500 exceptions instead.

New Features
----------------------

* SOLR-2540: CommitWithin as an Update Request parameter
  You can now specify &commitWithin=N (ms) on the update request (janhoy)

* SOLR-2383: /browse improvements: generalize range and date facet display
  Backported from trunk. Removed facet.date support in Velocity, since this is 
  deprecated in favor of facet.range (gsingers, janhoy)

* SOLR-2458: post.jar enhanced to handle JSON, CSV and <optimize> (janhoy)

* LUCENE-3234: add a new parameter hl.phraseLimit for FastVectorHighlighter speed up.
  (Mike Sokolov via koji)

* SOLR-2429: Ability to add cache=false to queries and query filters to avoid
  using the filterCache or queryCache.  A cost may also be specified and is used
  to order the evaluation of non-cached filters from least to greatest cost .
  For very expensive query filters (cost >= 100) if the query implements
  the PostFilter interface, it will be used to obtain a Collector that is
  checked only for documents that match the main query and all other filters.
  The "frange" query now implements the PostFilter interface.  (yonik)

* SOLR-2630: Added new XsltUpdateRequestHandler that works like
  XmlUpdateRequestHandler but allows to transform the POSTed XML document
  using XSLT. This allows to POST arbitrary XML documents to the update
  handler, as long as you also provide a XSL to transform them to a valid
  Solr input document.  (Upayavira, Uwe Schindler)

* SOLR-2615: Log individual updates (adds and deletes) at the FINE level
  before adding to the index.  Fix a null pointer exception in logging
  when there was no unique key. (David Smiley via yonik)

* LUCENE-2048: Added omitPositions to the schema, so you can omit position
  information while still indexing term frequencies.  (rmuir)

* SOLR-2584: add UniqFieldsUpdateProcessor that removes duplicate values in the
  specified fields. (Elmer Garduno, koji)

* SOLR-2670: Added NIOFSDirectoryFactory (yonik)

* SOLR-2523: Added support in SolrJ to easily interact with range facets.
  The range facet response can be parsed and is retrievable from the
  QueryResponse class. The SolrQuery class has convenient methods for using
  range facets. (Martijn van Groningen)

* SOLR-2637: Added support for group result parsing in SolrJ.
  (Tao Cheng, Martijn van Groningen)

* SOLR-2665: Added post group faceting. Facet counts are based on the most
  relevant document of each group matching the query. This feature has the
  same impact on the StatsComponent. (Martijn van Groningen)

* SOLR-2675: CoreAdminHandler now allows arbitrary properties to be
  specified when CREATEing a new SolrCore using property.* request
  params.  (Yury Kats, hossman)

* SOLR-2714: JSON update format - "null" field values are now dropped
  instead of causing an exception. (Trygve LaugstÃ¸l, yonik)


Optimizations
----------------------

* LUCENE-3233: Improved memory usage, build time, and performance of 
  SynonymFilterFactory.  (Mike McCandless, Robert Muir)

Bug Fixes
----------------------

* SOLR-2625: TermVectorComponent throws NPE if TF-IDF option is used without DF
  option. (Daniel Erenrich, Simon Willnauer)

* SOLR-2631: PingRequestHandler should not allow to ping itsself using "qt"
  param to prevent infinite loop. (Edoardo Tosca, Uwe Schindler)

* SOLR-2636: Fix explain functionality for negative queries. (Tom Hill via yonik)

* SOLR-2538: Range Faceting on long/double fields could overflow if values 
  bigger then the max int/float were used.
  (Erbi Hanka, hossman)

* SOLR-2230: CommonsHttpSolrServer.addFile could not be used to send 
  multiple files in a single request.
  (Stephan GÃ¼nther, hossman)

* SOLR-2541: PluginInfos was not correctly parsing <long/> tags when 
  initializing plugins
  (Frank Wesemann, hossman)

* SOLR-2623: Solr JMX MBeans do not survive core reloads (Alexey Serba, shalin)

* Fixed grouping bug when start is bigger than rows and format is simple that zero documents are returned even
  if there are documents to display. (Martijn van Groningen, Nikhil Chhaochharia)

* SOLR-2564: Fixed ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException when using simple format and
  start > 0 (Martijn van Groningen, Matteo Melli)

* SOLR-2642: Fixed sorting by function when using grouping. (Thomas Heigl, Martijn van Groningen)

* SOLR-2535: REGRESSION: in Solr 3.x and trunk the admin/file handler
  fails to show directory listings (David Smiley, Peter Wolanin via Erick Erickson)

* SOLR-2545: ExternalFileField file parsing would fail if any key
  contained an "=" character.  It now only looks for the last "=" delimiter 
  prior to the float value.
  (Markus Jelsma, hossman)

* SOLR-2662: When Solr is configured to have no queryResultCache, the
  "start" parameter was not honored and the documents returned were
   0 through start+offset.  (Markus Jelsma, yonik)

* SOLR-2669: Fix backwards validation of field properties in 
  SchemaField.calcProps (hossman)

* SOLR-2676: Add "welcome-file-list" to solr.war so admin UI works correctly 
  in servlet containers such as WebSphere that do not use a default list
  (Jay R. Jaeger, hossman)

* SOLR-2682: Remove addException() in SimpleFacet. FacetComponent no longer catches and embeds
  exceptions occurred during facet processing, it throws HTTP 400 or 500 exceptions instead. (koji)

* SOLR-2606: Fixed sort parsing of fields containing punctuation that 
  failed due to sort by function changes introduced in SOLR-1297
  (Mitsu Hadeishi, hossman)

* SOLR-2734: Fix debug info for MorLikeThisHandler (introduced when SOLR-860 was backported to 3x).
  (AndrÃ©s Cobas, hossman via koji)

 Other Changes
----------------------

* SOLR-2629: Eliminate deprecation warnings in some JSPs.
  (Bernd Fehling, hossman)

Build
----------------------

* SOLR-2452,SOLR-2653,LUCENE-3323,SOLR-2659,LUCENE-3329,SOLR-2666:
  Rewrote the Solr build system:
  - Integrated more fully with the Lucene build system: generalized the
    Lucene build system and eliminated duplication.
  - Converted all Solr contribs to the Lucene/Solr conventional src/ layout:
    java/, resources/, test/, and test-files/<contrib-name>.
  - Created a new Solr-internal module named "core" by moving the java/,
    test/, and test-files/ directories from solr/src/ to solr/core/src/.
  - Merged solr/src/webapp/src/ into solr/core/src/java/.
  - Eliminated solr/src/ by moving all its directories up one level;
    renamed solr/src/site/ to solr/site-src/ because solr/site/ already
    exists.
  - Merged solr/src/common/ into solr/solrj/src/java/.
  - Moved o.a.s.client.solrj.* and o.a.s.common.* tests from
    solr/src/test/ to solr/solrj/src/test/.
  - Made the solrj tests not depend on the solr core tests by moving
    some classes from solr/src/test/ to solr/test-framework/src/java/.
  - Each internal module (core/, solrj/, test-framework/, and webapp/)
    now has its own build.xml, from which it is possible to run
    module-specific targets.  solr/build.xml delegates all build
    tasks (via <ant dir="internal-module-dir"> calls) to these
    modules' build.xml files.
  (Steve Rowe, Robert Muir)

* LUCENE-3406: Add ant target 'package-local-src-tgz' to Lucene and Solr
  to package sources from the local working copy.
  (Seung-Yeoul Yang via Steve Rowe)

Documentation
----------------------

==================  3.3.0  ==================

Upgrading from Solr 3.2.0
----------------------
 * SolrCore's CloseHook API has been changed in a backward-incompatible way. It
   has been changed from an interface to an abstract class. Any custom 
   components which use the SolrCore.addCloseHook method will need to
   be modified accordingly. To migrate, put your old CloseHook#close impl into
   CloseHook#preClose.

New Features
----------------------

* SOLR-2378: A new, automaton-based, implementation of suggest (autocomplete)
  component, offering an order of magnitude smaller memory consumption
  compared to ternary trees and jaspell and very fast lookups at runtime.
  (Dawid Weiss)

* SOLR-2400: Field- and DocumentAnalysisRequestHandler now provide a position
  history for each token, so you can follow the token through all analysis stages.
  The output contains a separate int[] attribute containing all positions from
  previous Tokenizers/TokenFilters (called "positionHistory").
  (Uwe Schindler)
  
* SOLR-2524: (SOLR-236, SOLR-237, SOLR-1773, SOLR-1311) Grouping / Field collapsing
  using the Lucene grouping contrib. The search result can be grouped by field and query. 
  (Martijn van Groningen, Emmanuel Keller, Shalin Shekhar Mangar, Koji Sekiguchi, 
   IvÃ¡n de Prado, Ryan McKinley, Marc Sturlese, Peter Karich, Bojan Smid, 
   Charles Hornberger, Dieter Grad, Dmitry Lihachev, Doug Steigerwald,
   Karsten Sperling, Michael Gundlach, Oleg Gnatovskiy, Thomas Traeger,
   Harish Agarwal, yonik, Michael McCandless, Bill Bell)

* SOLR-1331: Added a srcCore parameter to CoreAdminHandler's mergeindexes action
  to merge one or more cores' indexes to a target core (shalin)

* SOLR-2610 -- Add an option to delete index through CoreAdmin UNLOAD action (shalin)

Optimizations
----------------------

* SOLR-2567: Solr now defaults to TieredMergePolicy. See http://s.apache.org/merging
  for more information.  (rmuir)

Bug Fixes
----------------------

* SOLR-2519: Improve text_* fieldTypes in example schema.xml: improve
  cross-language defaults for text_general; break out separate
  English-specific fieldTypes (Jan HÃ¸ydahl, hossman, Robert Muir,
  yonik, Mike McCandless)

* SOLR-2462: Fix extremely high memory usage problems with spellcheck.collate.
  Separately, an additional spellcheck.maxCollationEvaluations (default=10000)
  parameter is added to avoid excessive CPU time in extreme cases (e.g. long
  queries with many misspelled words).  (James Dyer via rmuir)

Other Changes
----------------------

* SOLR-2620: Removed unnecessary log4j jar from clustering contrib (Dawid Weiss).

* SOLR-2571: Add a commented out example of the spellchecker's thresholdTokenFrequency
  parameter to the example solrconfig.xml, and also add a unit test for this feature.
  (James Dyer via rmuir)
  
* SOLR-2576: Deprecate SpellingResult.add(Token token, int docFreq), please use
  SpellingResult.addFrequency(Token token, int docFreq) instead.
  (James Dyer via rmuir)

* SOLR-2574: Upgrade slf4j to v1.6.1 (shalin)

* LUCENE-3204: The maven-ant-tasks jar is now included in the source tree;
  users of the generate-maven-artifacts target no longer have to manually
  place this jar in the Ant classpath.  NOTE: when Ant looks for the 
  maven-ant-tasks jar, it looks first in its pre-existing classpath, so
  any copies it finds will be used instead of the copy included in the 
  Lucene/Solr source tree.  For this reason, it is recommeded to remove
  any copies of the maven-ant-tasks jar in the Ant classpath, e.g. under
  ~/.ant/lib/ or under the Ant installation's lib/ directory. (Steve Rowe)
  
* SOLR-2611: Fix typos in the example configuration (Eric Pugh via rmuir)

==================  3.2.0  ==================
Versions of Major Components
---------------------
Apache Tika 0.8
Carrot2 3.5.0


Upgrading from Solr 3.1
----------------------
  
* The updateRequestProcessorChain for a RequestHandler is now defined
  with update.chain rather than update.processor. The latter still works,
  but has been deprecated.

Detailed Change List
----------------------

New Features
----------------------

* SOLR-2496: Add ability to specify overwrite and commitWithin as request
  parameters (e.g. specified in the URL) when using the JSON update format,
  and added a simplified format for specifying multiple documents.
  Example: [{"id":"doc1"},{"id":"doc2"}] 
  (yonik)

* SOLR-2113: Add TermQParserPlugin, registered as "term".  This is useful
  when generating filter queries from terms returned from field faceting or
  the terms component. Example: fq={!term f=weight}1.5   (hossman, yonik) 

* SOLR-1915: DebugComponent now supports using a NamedList to model
  Explanation objects in it's responses instead of
  Explanation.toString  (hossman)

Optimizations
----------------------

Bug Fixes
----------------------

* SOLR-2445: Change the default qt to blank in form.jsp, because there is no "standard"
  request handler unless you have it in your solrconfig.xml explicitly. (koji)

* SOLR-2455: Prevent double submit of forms in admin interface.
  (Jeffrey Chang via uschindler)

* SOLR-2464: Fix potential slowness in QueryValueSource (the query() function) when
  the query is very sparse and may not match any documents in a segment. (yonik)

* SOLR-2469: When using java replication with replicateAfter=startup, the first
  commit point on server startup is never removed. (yonik)

* SOLR-2466: SolrJ's CommonsHttpSolrServer would retry requests on failure, regardless
  of the configured maxRetries, due to HttpClient having it's own retry mechanism
  by default.  The retryCount of HttpClient is now set to 0, and SolrJ does
  the retry.  (yonik)

* SOLR-2409: edismax parser - treat the text of a fielded query as a literal if the
  fieldname does not exist.  For example Mission: Impossible should not search on
  the "Mission" field unless it's a valid field in the schema.  (Ryan McKinley, yonik)

* SOLR-2403: facet.sort=index reported incorrect results for distributed search
  in a number of scenarios when facet.mincount>0.  This patch also adds some
  performance/algorithmic improvements when (facet.sort=count && facet.mincount=1
  && facet.limit=-1) and when (facet.sort=index && facet.mincount>0)  (yonik)

* SOLR-2333: The "rename" core admin action does not persist the new name to solr.xml
  (Rasmus Hahn, Paul R. Brown via Mark Miller)
  
* SOLR-2390: Performance of usePhraseHighlighter is terrible on very large Documents, 
  regardless of hl.maxDocCharsToAnalyze. (Mark Miller)

* SOLR-2474: The helper TokenStreams in analysis.jsp and AnalysisRequestHandlerBase
  did not clear all attributes so they displayed incorrect attribute values for tokens
  in later filter stages. (uschindler, rmuir, yonik)

* SOLR-2467: Fix <analyzer class="..." /> initialization so any errors 
  are logged properly.  (hossman)

* SOLR-2493: SolrQueryParser was fixed to not parse the SolrConfig DOM tree on each
  instantiation which is a huge slowdown.  (Stephane Bailliez via uschindler)

* SOLR-2495: The JSON parser could hang on corrupted input and could fail
  to detect numbers that were too large to fit in a long.  (yonik)

* SOLR-2520: Make JSON response format escape \u2029 as well as \u2028
  in strings since those characters are not valid in javascript strings
  (although they are valid in JSON strings).  (yonik)

* SOLR-2536: Add ReloadCacheRequestHandler to fix ExternalFileField bug (if reopenReaders
  set to true and no index segments have been changed, commit cannot trigger reload
  external file). (koji)

* SOLR-2539: VectorValueSource.floatVal incorrectly used byteVal on sub-sources.
  (Tom Liu via yonik)

* SOLR-2554: RandomSortField didn't work when used in a function query. (yonik)


Other Changes
----------------------

* SOLR-2061: Pull base tests out into a new Solr Test Framework module,
  and publish binary, javadoc, and source test-framework jars. 
  (Drew Farris, Robert Muir, Steve Rowe)

* SOLR-2105: Rename RequestHandler param 'update.processor' to 'update.chain'.
	(Jan HÃ¸ydahl via Mark Miller)
	
* SOLR-2485: Deprecate BaseResponseWriter, GenericBinaryResponseWriter, and 
  GenericTextResponseWriter.  These classes will be removed in 4.0.  (ryan)

* SOLR-2451: Enhance assertJQ to allow individual tests to specify the 
  tolerance delta used in numeric equalities.  This allows for slight 
  variance in asserting score comparisons in unit tests.
  (David Smiley, Chris Hostetter)

* SOLR-2528: Remove default="true" from HtmlEncoder in example solrconfig.xml,
  because html encoding confuses non-ascii users. (koji)

Build
----------------------

* LUCENE-3006: Building javadocs will fail on warnings by default.  Override with -Dfailonjavadocwarning=false (sarowe, gsingers)

Documentation
----------------------



==================  3.1.0 ==================
Versions of Major Components
---------------------
Apache Lucene 3.1.0
Apache Tika 0.8
Carrot2 3.4.2
Velocity 1.6.1 and Velocity Tools 2.0-beta3
Apache UIMA 2.3.1-SNAPSHOT


Upgrading from Solr 1.4
----------------------

* The Lucene index format has changed and as a result, once you upgrade,
  previous versions of Solr will no longer be able to read your indices.
  In a master/slave configuration, all searchers/slaves should be upgraded
  before the master.  If the master were to be updated first, the older
  searchers would not be able to read the new index format.

* The Solr JavaBin format has changed as of Solr 3.1. If you are using the
  JavaBin format, you will need to upgrade your SolrJ client. (SOLR-2034)

* The experimental ALIAS command has been removed (SOLR-1637)

* Using solr.xml is recommended for single cores also (SOLR-1621)

* Old syntax of <highlighting> configuration in solrconfig.xml
  is deprecated (SOLR-1696)

* The deprecated HTMLStripReader, HTMLStripWhitespaceTokenizerFactory and
  HTMLStripStandardTokenizerFactory were removed. To strip HTML tags,
  HTMLStripCharFilter should be used instead, and it works with any
  Tokenizer of your choice.  (SOLR-1657)

* Field compression is no longer supported. Fields that were formerly
  compressed will be uncompressed as index segments are merged. For
  shorter fields, this may actually be an improvement, as the compression
  used was not very good for short text. Some indexes may get larger though.

* SOLR-1845: The TermsComponent response format was changed so that the
  "terms" container is a map instead of a named list.  This affects
   response formats like JSON, but not XML. (yonik)

* SOLR-1876: All Analyzers and TokenStreams are now final to enforce
  the decorator pattern.  (rmuir, uschindler)

* LUCENE-2608: Added the ability to specify the accuracy on a per request basis.
  It is recommended that implementations of SolrSpellChecker should change over to the new SolrSpellChecker
  methods using the new SpellingOptions class, but are not required to.  While this change is
  backward compatible, the trunk version of Solr has already dropped support for all but the SpellingOptions method. (gsingers)

* readercycle script was removed. (SOLR-2046)

* In previous releases, sorting or evaluating function queries on
  fields that were "multiValued" (either by explicit declaration in
  schema.xml or by implict behavior because the "version" attribute on
  the schema was less then 1.2) did not generally work, but it would
  sometimes silently act as if it succeeded and order the docs
  arbitrarily.  Solr will now fail on any attempt to sort, or apply a
  function to, multi-valued fields

* The DataImportHandler jars are no longer included in the solr
  WAR and should be added in Solr's lib directory, or referenced
  via the <lib> directive in solrconfig.xml.


Detailed Change List
----------------------

New Features
----------------------

* SOLR-1302: Added several new distance based functions, including
  Great Circle (haversine), Manhattan, Euclidean and String (using the
  StringDistance methods in the Lucene spellchecker).
  Also added geohash(), deg() and rad() convenience functions.
  See http://wiki.apache.org/solr/FunctionQuery. (gsingers)

* SOLR-1553: New dismax parser implementation (accessible as "edismax")
  that supports full lucene syntax, improved reserved char escaping,
  fielded queries, improved proximity boosting, and improved stopword
  handling. Note: status is experimental for now. (yonik)

* SOLR-1574: Add many new functions from java Math (e.g. sin, cos) (yonik)

* SOLR-1569: Allow functions to take in literal strings by modifying the
  FunctionQParser and adding LiteralValueSource (gsingers)

* SOLR-1571: Added unicode collation support though Lucene's CollationKeyFilter
  (Robert Muir via shalin)

* SOLR-785: Distributed Search support for SpellCheckComponent
  (Matthew Woytowitz, shalin)

* SOLR-1625: Add regexp support for TermsComponent (Uri Boness via noble)

* SOLR-1297: Add sort by Function capability (gsingers, yonik)

* SOLR-1139: Add TermsComponent Query and Response Support in SolrJ (Matt Weber via shalin)

* SOLR-1177: Distributed Search support for TermsComponent (Matt Weber via shalin)

* SOLR-1621, SOLR-1722: Allow current single core deployments to be specified by solr.xml (Mark Miller , noble)

* SOLR-1532: Allow StreamingUpdateSolrServer to use a provided HttpClient (Gabriele Renzi via shalin)

* SOLR-1653: Add PatternReplaceCharFilter (koji)

* SOLR-1131: FieldTypes can now output multiple Fields per Type and still be searched.  This can be handy for hiding the details of a particular
  implementation such as in the spatial case. (Chris Mattmann, shalin, noble, gsingers, yonik)

* SOLR-1586: Add support for Geohash and Spatial Tile FieldType (Chris Mattmann, gsingers)

* SOLR-1697: PluginInfo should load plugins w/o class attribute also (noble)

* SOLR-1268: Incorporate FastVectorHighlighter (koji)

* SOLR-1750: SolrInfoMBeanHandler added for simpler programmatic access
  to info currently available from registry.jsp and stats.jsp
  (ehatcher, hossman)

* SOLR-1815: SolrJ now preserves the order of facet queries. (yonik)

* SOLR-1677: Add support for choosing the Lucene Version for Lucene components within
  Solr. (Uwe Schindler, Mark Miller)

* SOLR-1379: Add RAMDirectoryFactory for non-persistent in memory index storage.
  (Alex Baranov via yonik)

* SOLR-1857: Synced Solr analysis with Lucene 3.1. Added KeywordMarkerFilterFactory
  and StemmerOverrideFilterFactory, which can be used to tune stemming algorithms.
  Added factories for Bulgarian, Czech, Hindi, Turkish, and Wikipedia analysis. Improved the
  performance of SnowballPorterFilterFactory.  (rmuir)

* SOLR-1657: Converted remaining TokenStreams to the Attributes-based API. All Solr
  TokenFilters now support custom Attributes, and some have improved performance:
  especially WordDelimiterFilter and CommonGramsFilter.  (rmuir, cmale, uschindler)

* SOLR-1740: ShingleFilterFactory supports the "minShingleSize" and "tokenSeparator"
  parameters for controlling the minimum shingle size produced by the filter, and
  the separator string that it uses, respectively.  (Steven Rowe via rmuir)

* SOLR-744: ShingleFilterFactory supports the "outputUnigramsIfNoShingles"
  parameter, to output unigrams if the number of input tokens is fewer than
  minShingleSize, and no shingles can be generated.
  (Chris Harris via Steven Rowe)

* SOLR-1923: PhoneticFilterFactory now has support for the
  Caverphone algorithm. (rmuir)

* SOLR-1957: The VelocityResponseWriter contrib moved to core.
       Example search UI now available at http://localhost:8983/solr/browse
       (ehatcher)

* SOLR-1974: Add LimitTokenCountFilterFactory. (koji)

* SOLR-1966: QueryElevationComponent can now return just the included results in the elevation file (gsingers, yonik)

* SOLR-1556: TermVectorComponent now supports per field overrides.  Also, it now throws an error
 if passed in fields do not exist and warnings
  if fields that do not have term vector options (termVectors, offsets, positions)
   that align with the schema declaration. It also
    will now return warnings about (gsingers)

* SOLR-1985: FastVectorHighlighter: add wrapper class for Lucene's SingleFragListBuilder (koji)

* SOLR-1984: Add HyphenationCompoundWordTokenFilterFactory. (PB via rmuir)

* SOLR-397: Date Faceting now supports a "facet.date.include" param
  for specifying when the upper & lower end points of computed date
  ranges should be included in the range.  Legal values are: "all",
  "lower", "upper", "edge", and "outer".  For backwards compatibility
  the default value is the set: [lower,upper,edge], so that al ranges
  between start and ed are inclusive of their endpoints, but the
  "before" and "after" ranges are not.

* SOLR-945: JSON update handler that accepts add, delete, commit
  commands in JSON format. (Ryan McKinley, yonik)

* SOLR-2015: Add a boolean attribute autoGeneratePhraseQueries to TextField.
  autoGeneratePhraseQueries="true" (the default) causes the query parser to
  generate phrase queries if multiple tokens are generated from a single
  non-quoted analysis string.  For example WordDelimiterFilter splitting text:pdp-11
  will cause the parser to generate text:"pdp 11" rather than (text:PDP OR text:11).
  Note that autoGeneratePhraseQueries="true" tends to not work well for non whitespace
  delimited languages. (yonik)

* SOLR-1925: Add CSVResponseWriter (use wt=csv) that returns the list of documents
  in CSV format. (Chris Mattmann, yonik)

* SOLR-1240: "Range Faceting" has been added.  This is a generalization
  of the existing "Date Faceting" logic so that it now supports any
  all stock numeric field types that support range queries in addition
  to dates. facet.date is now deprecated in favor of this generalized mechanism.
  (Gijs Kunze, hossman)

* SOLR-2021: Add SolrEncoder plugin to Highlighter. (koji)

* SOLR-2030: Make FastVectorHighlighter use of SolrEncoder. (koji)

* SOLR-2053: Add support for custom comparators in Solr spellchecker, per LUCENE-2479 (gsingers)

* SOLR-2049: Add hl.multiValuedSeparatorChar for FastVectorHighlighter, per LUCENE-2603. (koji)

* SOLR-2059: Add "types" attribute to WordDelimiterFilterFactory, which
  allows you to customize how WordDelimiterFilter tokenizes text with
  a configuration file.  (Peter Karich, rmuir)

* SOLR-2099: Add ability to throttle rsync based replication using rsync option --bwlimit.
  (Brandon Evans via koji)

* SOLR-1316: Create autosuggest component.
   (Ankul Garg, Jason Rutherglen, Shalin Shekhar Mangar, Grant Ingersoll, Robert Muir, ab)

* SOLR-1568: Added "native" filtering support for PointType, GeohashField.  Added LatLonType with filtering support too.  See
  	     http://wiki.apache.org/solr/SpatialSearch and the example.  Refactored some items in Lucene spatial.
	     Removed SpatialTileField as the underlying CartesianTier is broken beyond repair and is going to be moved. (gsingers)

* SOLR-2128: Full parameter substitution for function queries.
  Example: q=add($v1,$v2)&v1=mul(popularity,5)&v2=20.0
  (yonik)

* SOLR-2133: Function query parser can now parse multiple comma separated
  value sources.  It also now fails if there is extra unexpected text
  after parsing the functions, instead of silently ignoring it.
  This allows expressions like q=dist(2,vector(1,2),$pt)&pt=3,4   (yonik)

* SOLR-2157: Suggester should return alpha-sorted results when onlyMorePopular=false (ab)

* SOLR-2010: Added ability to verify that spell checking collations have
   actual results in the index.  (James Dyer via gsingers)

* SOLR-2188: Added "maxTokenLength" argument to the factories for ClassicTokenizer,
  StandardTokenizer, and UAX29URLEmailTokenizer. (Steven Rowe)

* SOLR-2129: Added a Solr module for dynamic metadata extraction/indexing with Apache UIMA.
  See contrib/uima/README.txt for more information.  (Tommaso Teofili via rmuir)

* SOLR-2325: Allow tagging and exlcusion of main query for faceting. (yonik)

* SOLR-2263: Add ability for RawResponseWriter to stream binary files as well as
  text files.  (Eric Pugh via yonik)

* SOLR-860: Add debug output for MoreLikeThis. (koji)

* SOLR-1057: Add PathHierarchyTokenizerFactory. (ryan, koji)

Optimizations
----------------------

* SOLR-1679: Don't build up string messages in SolrCore.execute unless they
  are necessary for the current log level.
  (Fuad Efendi and hossman)

* SOLR-1874: Optimize PatternReplaceFilter for better performance. (rmuir, uschindler)

* SOLR-1968: speed up initial filter cache population for facet.method=enum and
  also big terms for multi-valued facet.method=fc.  The resulting speedup
  for the first facet request is anywhere from 30% to 32x, depending on how many
  terms are in the field and how many documents match per term.  (yonik)

* SOLR-2089: Speed up UnInvertedField faceting (facet.method=fc for
  multi-valued fields) when facet.limit is both high, and a high enough
  percentage of the number of unique terms in the field.  Extreme cases
  yield speedups over 3x. (yonik)

* SOLR-2046: add common functions to scripts-util. (koji)

Bug Fixes
----------------------
* SOLR-1769: Solr 1.4 Replication - Repeater throwing NullPointerException (JÃ¶rgen Rydenius via noble)

* SOLR-1432: Make the new ValueSource.getValues(context,reader) delegate
  to the original ValueSource.getValues(reader) so custom sources
  will work. (yonik)

* SOLR-1572: FastLRUCache correctly implemented the LRU policy only
  for the first 2B accesses. (yonik)

* SOLR-1582: copyField was ignored for BinaryField types (gsingers)

* SOLR-1563: Binary fields, including trie-based numeric fields, caused null
  pointer exceptions in the luke request handler. (yonik)

* SOLR-1577: The example solrconfig.xml defaulted to a solr data dir
  relative to the current working directory, even if a different solr home
  was being used.  The new behavior changes the default to a zero length
  string, which is treated the same as if no dataDir had been specified,
  hence the "data" directory under the solr home will be used.  (yonik)

* SOLR-1584: SolrJ - SolrQuery.setIncludeScore() incorrectly added
  fl=score to the parameter list instead of appending score to the
  existing field list. (yonik)

* SOLR-1580: Solr Configuration ignores 'mergeFactor' parameter, always
  uses Lucene default. (Lance Norskog via Mark Miller)

* SOLR-1593: ReverseWildcardFilter didn't work for surrogate pairs
  (i.e. code points outside of the BMP), resulting in incorrect
  matching.  This change requires reindexing for any content with
  such characters.  (Robert Muir, yonik)

* SOLR-1596: A rollback operation followed by the shutdown of Solr
  or the close of a core resulted in a warning:
  "SEVERE: SolrIndexWriter was not closed prior to finalize()" although
  there were no other consequences. (yonik)

* SOLR-1595: StreamingUpdateSolrServer used the platform default character
  set when streaming updates, rather than using UTF-8 as the HTTP headers
  indicated, leading to an encoding mismatch. (hossman, yonik)

* SOLR-1587: A distributed search request with fl=score, didn't match
  the behavior of a non-distributed request since it only returned
  the id,score fields instead of all fields in addition to score. (yonik)

* SOLR-1601: Schema browser does not indicate presence of charFilter. (koji)

* SOLR-1615: Backslash escaping did not work in quoted strings
  for local param arguments. (Wojtek Piaseczny, yonik)

* SOLR-1628: log contains incorrect number of adds and deletes.
  (Thijs Vonk via yonik)

* SOLR-343: Date faceting now respects facet.mincount limiting
  (Uri Boness, Raiko Eckstein via hossman)

* SOLR-1624: Highlighter only highlights values from the first field  value
  in a multivalued field when term positions (term vectors) are stored.
  (Chris Harris via yonik)

* SOLR-1635: Fixed error message when numeric values can't be parsed by
  DOMUtils - notably for plugin init params in solrconfig.xml.
  (hossman)

* SOLR-1651: Fixed Incorrect dataimport handler package name in SolrResourceLoader
  (Akshay Ukey via shalin)

* SOLR-1660: CapitalizationFilter crashes if you use the maxWordCountOption
  (Robert Muir via shalin)

* SOLR-1667: PatternTokenizer does not reset attributes such as positionIncrementGap
  (Robert Muir via shalin)

* SOLR-1711: SolrJ - StreamingUpdateSolrServer had a race condition that
  could halt the streaming of documents. The original patch to fix this
  (never officially released) introduced another hanging bug due to
  connections not being released.
  (Attila Babo, Erik Hetzner, Johannes Tuchscherer via yonik)

* SOLR-1748, SOLR-1747, SOLR-1746, SOLR-1745, SOLR-1744: Streams and Readers
  retrieved from ContentStreams are not closed in various places, resulting
  in file descriptor leaks.
  (Christoff Brill, Mark Miller)

* SOLR-1753: StatsComponent throws NPE when getting statistics for facets in distributed search
  (Janne Majaranta via koji)

  result in incorrectly sorted results.  (yonik)

* SOLR-1798: Small memory leak (~100 bytes) in fastLRUCache for every
  commit. (yonik)

  a ClassCastException when a Map containing a non-String key is used.
  (Frank Wesemann, hossman)

* SOLR-1797: fix ConcurrentModificationException and potential memory
  leaks in ResourceLoader. (yonik)

  U+2028 - 'LINE SEPARATOR' (Robert Hofstra, yonik)

* SOLR-1914: Change the JSON response format to output float/double
  values of NaN,Infinity,-Infinity as strings. (yonik)

* SOLR-1948: PatternTokenizerFactory should use parent's args (koji)

* SOLR-1870: Indexing documents using the 'javabin' format no longer
  fails with a ClassCastException whenSolrInputDocuments contain field
  values which are Collections or other classes that implement
  Iterable. (noble, hossman)

* SOLR-1981: Solr will now fail correctly if solr.xml attempts to
  specify multiple cores that have the same name (hossman)

* SOLR-1791: Fix messed up core names on admin gui (yonik via koji)

* SOLR-1995: Change date format from "hour in am/pm" to "hour in day"
  in CoreContainer and SnapShooter. (Hayato Ito, koji)

* SOLR-2008: avoid possible RejectedExecutionException w/autoCommit
  by making SolreCore close the UpdateHandler before closing the
  SearchExecutor.  (NarasimhaRaju, hossman)

* SOLR-2036: Avoid expensive fieldCache ram estimation for the
  admin stats page. (yonik)

* SOLR-2047: ReplicationHandler should accept bool type for enable flag. (koji)

* SOLR-1630: Fix spell checking collation issue related to token positions (rmuir, gsingers)

* SOLR-2100: The replication handler backup command didn't save the commit
  point and hence could fail when a newer commit caused the older commit point
  to be removed before it was finished being copied.  This did not affect
  normal master/slave replication.  (Peter Sturge via yonik)

* SOLR-2114: Fixed parsing error in hsin function.  The function signature has changed slightly. (gsingers)

* SOLR-2083: SpellCheckComponent misreports suggestions when distributed (James Dyer via gsingers)

* SOLR-2111: Change exception handling in distributed faceting to work more
  like non-distributed faceting, change facet_counts/exception from a String
  to a List<String> to enable listing all exceptions that happened, and
  prevent an exception in one facet command from affecting another
  facet command. (yonik)

* SOLR-2110: Remove the restriction on names for local params
  substitution/dereferencing.  Properly encode local params in
  distributed faceting.  (yonik)

* SOLR-2135: Fix behavior of ConcurrentLRUCache when asking for
  getLatestAccessedItems(0) or getOldestAccessedItems(0).
  (David Smiley via hossman)

* SOLR-2148: Highlighter doesn't support q.alt. (koji)

* SOLR-2180: It was possible for EmbeddedSolrServer to leave searchers
  open if a request threw an exception. (yonik)

* SOLR-2173: Suggester should always rebuild Lookup data if Lookup.load fails. (ab)

* SOLR-2081: BaseResponseWriter.isStreamingDocs causes
  SingleResponseWriter.end to be called 2x
  (Chris A. Mattmann via hossman)

* SOLR-2219: The init() method of every SolrRequestHandler was being
  called twice. (ambikeshwar singh and hossman)

* SOLR-2285: duplicate SolrEventListeners no longer created (hossman)

* SOLR-1993: fix String cast assumption in JavaBinCodec - specific
  addresses "commitWithin" option on Update requests.
  (noble, hossman, and Maxim Valyanskiy)

* SOLR-2261: fix velocity template layout.vm that referred to an older
  version of jquery.  (Eric Pugh via rmuir)

* SOLR-2307: fix bug in PHPSerializedResponseWriter (wt=phps) when
  dealing with SolrDocumentList objects -- ie: sharded queries.
  (Antonio Verni via hossman)

* SOLR-2127: Fixed serialization of default core and indentation of solr.xml when serializing.
  (Ephraim Ofir, Mark Miller)

* SOLR-2320: Fixed ReplicationHandler detail reporting for masters
  (hossman)

* SOLR-482: Provide more exception handling in CSVLoader (gsingers)

* SOLR-1283: HTMLStripCharFilter sometimes threw a "Mark Invalid" exception.
  (Julien Coloos, hossman, yonik)

* SOLR-2085: Improve SolrJ behavior when FacetComponent comes before
  QueryComponent (Tomas Salfischberger via hossman)

* SOLR-1940: Fix SolrDispatchFilter behavior when Content-Type is
  unknown (Lance Norskog and hossman)

* SOLR-1983: snappuller fails when modifiedConfFiles is not empty and
  full copy of index is needed. (Alexander Kanarsky via yonik)

* SOLR-2156: SnapPuller fails to clean Old Index Directories on Full Copy
  (Jayendra Patil via yonik)

* SOLR-96: Fix XML parsing in XMLUpdateRequestHandler and
  DocumentAnalysisRequestHandler to respect charset from XML file and only
  use HTTP header's "Content-Type" as a "hint". (uschindler)

* SOLR-2339: Fix sorting to explicitly generate an error if you
  attempt to sort on a multiValued field. (hossman)

* SOLR-2348: Fix field types to explicitly generate an error if you
  attempt to get a ValueSource for a multiValued field. (hossman)

* SOLR-2380: Distributed faceting could miss values when facet.sort=index
  and when facet.offset was greater than 0. (yonik)

* SOLR-1656: XIncludes and other HREFs in XML files loaded by ResourceLoader
  are fixed to be resolved using the URI standard (RFC 2396). The system
  identifier is no longer a plain filename with path, it gets initialized
  using a custom URI scheme "solrres:". This scheme is resolved using a
  EntityResolver that utilizes ResourceLoader
  (org.apache.solr.common.util.SystemIdResolver). This makes all relative
  pathes in Solr's config files behave like expected. This change
  introduces some backwards breaks in the API: Some config classes
  (Config, SolrConfig, IndexSchema) were changed to take
  org.xml.sax.InputSource instead of InputStream. There may also be some
  backwards breaks in existing config files, it is recommended to check
  your config files / XSLTs and replace all XIncludes/HREFs that were
  hacked to use absolute paths to use relative ones. (uschindler)

* SOLR-309: Fix FieldType so setting an analyzer on a FieldType that
  doesn't expect it will generate an error.  Practically speaking this
  means that Solr will now correctly generate an error on
  initialization if the schema.xml contains an analyzer configuration
  for a fieldType that does not use TextField.  (hossman)

* SOLR-2192: StreamingUpdateSolrServer.blockUntilFinished was not
  thread safe and could throw an exception. (yonik)

Other Changes
----------------------

* SOLR-1602: Refactor SOLR package structure to include o.a.solr.response
  and move QueryResponseWriters in there
  (Chris A. Mattmann, ryan, hoss)

* SOLR-1516: Addition of an abstract BaseResponseWriter class to simplify the
  development of QueryResponseWriter implementations.

* SOLR-1570: Log warnings if uniqueKey is multi-valued or not stored (hossman, shalin)

* SOLR-1558: QueryElevationComponent only works if the uniqueKey field is
  implemented using StrField.  In previous versions of Solr no warning or
  error would be generated if you attempted to use QueryElevationComponent,
  it would just fail in unexpected ways.  This has been changed so that it
  will fail with a clear error message on initialization. (hossman)

* SOLR-1611: Added Lucene 2.9.1 collation contrib jar to lib (shalin)

* SOLR-1608: Extract base class from TestDistributedSearch to make
  it easy to write test cases for other distributed components. (shalin)

* SOLR-1268: Add Lucene 2.9-dev r888785 FastVectorHighlighter contrib jar to lib. (koji)

* SOLR-1538: Reordering of object allocations in ConcurrentLRUCache to eliminate
  (an extremely small) potential for deadlock.
  (gabriele renzi via hossman)

* SOLR-1588: Removed some very old dead code.
  (Chris A. Mattmann via hossman)

* SOLR-1696 : Deprecate old <highlighting> syntax and move configuration to HighlightComponent (noble)

* SOLR-1727: SolrEventListener should extend NamedListInitializedPlugin (noble)

* SOLR-1771: Improved error message when StringIndex cannot be initialized
  for a function query (hossman)

* SOLR-1695: Improved error messages when adding a document that does not
  contain exactly one value for the uniqueKey field (hossman)

* SOLR-1776: DismaxQParser and ExtendedDismaxQParser now use the schema.xml
  "defaultSearchField" as the default value for the "qf" param instead of failing
  with an error when "qf" is not specified.  (hossman)

* SOLR-1851: luceneAutoCommit no longer has any effect - it has been remove (Mark Miller)

* SOLR-1865: SolrResourceLoader.getLines ignores Byte Order Markers (BOMs) at the
  beginning of input files, these are often created by editors such as Windows
  Notepad.  (rmuir, hossman)

* SOLR-1938: ElisionFilterFactory will use a default set of French contractions
  if you do not supply a custom articles file.  (rmuir)

* SOLR-2003: SolrResourceLoader will report any encoding errors, rather than
  silently using replacement characters for invalid inputs (blargy via rmuir)

* SOLR-1804: Google collections updated to Google Guava (which is a superset of collections and contains bug fixes) (gsingers)

* SOLR-2034: Switch to JavaBin codec version 2. Strings are now serialized
  as the number of UTF-8 bytes, followed by the bytes in UTF-8. Previously
  Strings were serialized as the number of UTF-16 chars, followed by the
  bytes in Modified UTF-8. (hossman, yonik, rmuir)

* SOLR-2013: Add mapping-FoldToASCII.txt to example conf directory.
  (Steven Rowe via koji)

* SOLR-2213: Upgrade to jQuery 1.4.3 (Erick Erickson via ryan)

* SOLR-1826: Add unit tests for highlighting with termOffsets=true
  and overlapping tokens. (Stefan Oestreicher via rmuir)

* SOLR-2340: Add version infos to message in JavaBinCodec when throwing
  exception. (koji)

* SOLR-2350: Since Solr no longer requires XML files to be in UTF-8
  (see SOLR-96) SimplePostTool (aka: post.jar) has been improved to
  work with files of any mime-type or charset. (hossman)

* SOLR-2365: Move DIH jars out of solr.war (David Smiley via yonik)

* SOLR-2381: Include a patched version of Jetty (6.1.26 + JETTY-1340)
  to fix problematic UTF-8 handling for supplementary characters.
  (Bernd Fehling, uschindler, yonik, rmuir)

* SOLR-2391: The preferred Content-Type for XML was changed to
  application/xml. XMLResponseWriter now only delivers using this
  type; updating documents and analyzing documents is still supported
  using text/xml as Content-Type, too. If you have clients that are
  hardcoded on text/xml as Content-Type, you have to change them.
  (uschindler, rmuir)

* SOLR-2414: All ResponseWriters now use only ServletOutputStreams
  and wrap their own Writer around it when serializing. This fixes
  the bug in PHPSerializedResponseWriter that produced wrong string
  length if the servlet container had a broken UTF-8 encoding that was
  in fact CESU-8 (see SOLR-1091). The system property to enable the
  CESU-8 byte counting in PHPSerializesResponseWriters for broken
  servlet containers was therefore removed and is now ignored if set.
  Output is always UTF-8.  (uschindler, yonik, rmuir)

Build
----------------------

* SOLR-1522: Automated release signing process. (gsingers)

* SOLR-1891: Make lucene-jars-to-solr fail if copying any of the jars fails, and

================== Release 1.4.0 ==================
Release Date:  See http://lucene.apache.org/solr for the official release date.

Upgrading from Solr 1.3
-----------------------

There is a new default faceting algorithm for multiVaued fields that should be
faster for most cases.  One can revert to the previous algorithm (which has
also been improved somewhat) by adding facet.method=enum to the request.

Searching and sorting is now done on a per-segment basis, meaning that
the FieldCache entries used for sorting and for function queries are
created and used per-segment and can be reused for segments that don't
change between index updates.  While generally beneficial, this can lead
to increased memory usage over 1.3 in certain scenarios: 
  1) A single valued field that was used for both sorting and faceting
in 1.3 would have used the same top level FieldCache entry.  In 1.4, 
sorting will use entries at the segment level while faceting will still
use entries at the top reader level, leading to increased memory usage.
  2) Certain function queries such as ord() and rord() require a top level
FieldCache instance and can thus lead to increased memory usage.  Consider
replacing ord() and rord() with alternatives, such as function queries
based on ms() for date boosting.

If you use custom Tokenizer or TokenFilter components in a chain specified in
schema.xml, they must support reusability.  If your Tokenizer or TokenFilter
maintains state, it should implement reset().  If your TokenFilteFactory does
not return a subclass of TokenFilter, then it should implement reset() and call
reset() on it's input TokenStream.  TokenizerFactory implementations must
now return a Tokenizer rather than a TokenStream.

New users of Solr 1.4 will have omitTermFreqAndPositions enabled for non-text
indexed fields by default, which avoids indexing term frequency, positions, and
payloads, making the index smaller and faster.  If you are upgrading from an
earlier Solr release and want to enable omitTermFreqAndPositions by default,
change the schema version from 1.1 to 1.2 in schema.xml.  Remove any existing
index and restart Solr to ensure that omitTermFreqAndPositions completely takes
affect.

The default QParserPlugin used by the QueryComponent for parsing the "q" param
has been changed, to remove support for the deprecated use of ";" as a separator
between the query string and the sort options when no "sort" param was used.
Users who wish to continue using the semi-colon based method of specifying the
sort options should explicitly set the defType param to "lucenePlusSort" on all
requests. (The simplest way to do this is by specifying it as a default param
for your request handlers in solrconfig.xml, see the example solrconfig.xml for
sample syntax.) 

If spellcheck.extendedResults=true, the response format for suggestions
has changed, see SOLR-1071.

Use of the "charset" option when configuring the following Analysis
Factories has been deprecated and will cause a warning to be logged.
In future versions of Solr attempting to use this option will cause an
error.  See SOLR-1410 for more information.

Versions of Major Components
----------------------------
Apache Lucene 2.9.1  (r832363  on 2.9 branch)
Apache Tika 0.4
Carrot2 3.1.0

Lucene Information
----------------

Since Solr is built on top of Lucene, many people add customizations to Solr
that are dependent on Lucene.  Please see http://lucene.apache.org/java/2_9_0/,
especially http://lucene.apache.org/java/2_9_0/changes/Changes.html for more
information on the version of Lucene used in Solr.

Detailed Change List
----------------------

New Features
----------------------
 1. SOLR-560: Use SLF4J logging API rather then JDK logging.  The packaged .war file is
    shipped with a JDK logging implementation, so logging configuration for the .war should
    be identical to solr 1.3.  However, if you are using the .jar file, you can select 
    which logging implementation to use by dropping a different binding.  
    See: http://www.slf4j.org/  (ryan)

 2. SOLR-617: Allow configurable index deletion policy and provide a default implementation which
    allows deletion of commit points on various criteria such as number of commits, age of commit
    point and optimized status.
    See http://lucene.apache.org/java/2_3_2/api/org/apache/lucene/index/IndexDeletionPolicy.html
    (yonik, Noble Paul, Akshay Ukey via shalin)

 3. SOLR-658: Allow Solr to load index from arbitrary directory in dataDir
    (Noble Paul, Akshay Ukey via shalin)

 4. SOLR-793: Add 'commitWithin' argument to the update add command.  This behaves
    similar to the global autoCommit maxTime argument except that it is set for
    each request.  (ryan)

 5. SOLR-670: Add support for rollbacks in UpdateHandler. This allows user to rollback all changes
    since the last commit. (Noble Paul, koji via shalin)

 6. SOLR-813: Adding DoubleMetaphone Filter and Factory.  Similar to the PhoneticFilter,
    but this uses DoubleMetaphone specific calls (including alternate encoding)
    (Todd Feak via ryan)

 7. SOLR-680: Add StatsComponent. This gets simple statistics on matched numeric fields,
    including: min, max, mean, median, stddev.  (koji, ryan)

    7.1 SOLR-1380: Added support for multi-valued fields (Harish Agarwal via gsingers)

 8. SOLR-561: Added Replication implemented in Java as a request handler. Supports index replication
    as well as configuration replication and exposes detailed statistics and progress information
    on the Admin page. Works on all platforms. (Noble Paul, yonik, Akshay Ukey, shalin)

 9. SOLR-746: Added "omitHeader" request parameter to omit the header from the response.
    (Noble Paul via shalin)

10. SOLR-651: Added TermVectorComponent for serving up term vector information, plus IDF.
    See http://wiki.apache.org/solr/TermVectorComponent (gsingers, Vaijanath N. Rao, Noble Paul)

12. SOLR-795: SpellCheckComponent supports building indices on optimize if configured in solrconfig.xml
    (Jason Rennie, shalin)

13. SOLR-667: A LRU cache implementation based upon ConcurrentHashMap and other techniques to reduce
    contention and synchronization overhead, to utilize multiple CPU cores more effectively.
    (Fuad Efendi, Noble Paul, yonik via shalin)

14. SOLR-465: Add configurable DirectoryProvider so that alternate Directory
    implementations can be specified via solrconfig.xml.  The default
    DirectoryProvider will use NIOFSDirectory for better concurrency
    on non Windows platforms.  (Mark Miller, TJ Laurenzo via yonik)

15. SOLR-822: Add CharFilter so that characters can be filtered (e.g. character normalization)
    before Tokenizer/TokenFilters. (koji)
    
16. SOLR-829: Allow slaves to request compressed files from master during replication
    (Simon Collins, Noble Paul, Akshay Ukey via shalin)

17. SOLR-877: Added TermsComponent for accessing Lucene's TermEnum capabilities.
    Useful for auto suggest and possibly distributed search.  Not distributed search compliant.  (gsingers)
    - Added mincount and maxcount options (Khee Chin via gsingers)

18. SOLR-538: Add maxChars attribute for copyField function so that the length limit for destination
    can be specified.
    (Georgios Stamatis, Lars Kotthoff, Chris Harris via koji)

19. SOLR-284: Added support for extracting content from binary documents like MS Word and PDF using Apache Tika.  See also contrib/extraction/CHANGES.txt (Eric Pugh, Chris Harris, yonik, gsingers)

20. SOLR-819: Added factories for Arabic support (gsingers)

21. SOLR-781: Distributed search ability to sort field.facet values
    lexicographically.  facet.sort values "true" and "false" are
    also deprecated and replaced with "count" and "lex".
    (Lars Kotthoff via yonik)

22. SOLR-821: Add support for replication to copy conf file to slave with a different name. This allows replication
    of solrconfig.xml
    (Noble Paul, Akshay Ukey via shalin)

23. SOLR-911: Add support for multi-select faceting by allowing filters to be
    tagged and facet commands to exclude certain filters.  This patch also
    added the ability to change the output key for facets in the response, and
    optimized distributed faceting refinement by lowering parsing overhead and
    by making requests and responses smaller.

24. SOLR-876: WordDelimiterFilter now supports a splitOnNumerics
    option, as well as a list of protected terms.
    (Dan Rosher via hossman)

25. SOLR-928: SolrDocument and SolrInputDocument now implement the Map<String,?>
    interface.  This should make plugging into other standard tools easier. (ryan)

26. SOLR-847: Enhance the snappull command in ReplicationHandler to accept masterUrl.
    (Noble Paul, Preetam Rao via shalin)

27. SOLR-540: Add support for globbing in field names to highlight.
    For example, hl.fl=*_text will highlight all fieldnames ending with
    _text.  (Lars Kotthoff via yonik)

28. SOLR-906: Adding a StreamingUpdateSolrServer that writes update commands to 
    an open HTTP connection.  If you are using solrj for bulk update requests
    you should consider switching to this implementaion.  However, note that
    the error handling is not immediate as it is with the standard SolrServer.
    (ryan)

29. SOLR-865: Adding support for document updates in binary format and corresponding support in Solrj client.
    (Noble Paul via shalin)

30. SOLR-763: Add support for Lucene's PositionFilter (Mck SembWever via shalin)

    the CoreAdmin create command. (Noble Paul via shalin)

34. SOLR-850: Addition of timeouts for distributed searching. Configurable through 'shard-socket-timeout' and
    'shard-connection-timeout' parameters in SearchHandler. (Patrick O'Leary via shalin)

37. SOLR-739: Add support for OmitTf (Mark Miller via yonik)

38. SOLR-1046: Nested query support for the function query parser
    and lucene query parser (the latter existed as an undocumented 
    feature in 1.3) (yonik)

39. SOLR-940: Add support for Lucene's Trie Range Queries by providing new FieldTypes in
    schema for int, float, long, double and date.  Single-valued Trie based
    fields with a precisionStep will index multiple precisions and enable
    faster range queries.  (Uwe Schindler, yonik, shalin)

40. SOLR-1038: Enhance CommonsHttpSolrServer to add docs in batch using an iterator API (Noble Paul via shalin)

41. SOLR-844: A SolrServer implementation to front-end multiple solr servers and provides load balancing and failover
    support (Noble Paul, Mark Miller, hossman via shalin)

42. SOLR-939: ValueSourceRangeFilter/Query - filter based on values in a FieldCache entry or on any arbitrary function of field values. (yonik)

43. SOLR-1095: Fixed performance problem in the StopFilterFactory and simplified code.  Added tests as well.  (gsingers)

    replication. (Jeff Newburn, Noble Paul, shalin)

45. SOLR-1115: <bool>on</bool> and <bool>yes</bool> work as expected in solrconfig.xml. (koji)

46. SOLR-1099:  A FieldAnalysisRequestHandler which provides the analysis functionality of the web admin page as
    a service. The AnalysisRequestHandler is renamed to DocumentAnalysisRequestHandler which is enhanced with
    query analysis and showMatch support. AnalysisRequestHandler is now deprecated. Support for both
    FieldAnalysisRequestHandler and DocumentAnalysisRequestHandler is also provided in the Solrj client.
    (Uri Boness, shalin)

47. SOLR-1106: Made CoreAdminHandler Actions pluggable so that additional actions may be plugged in or the existing
    ones can be overridden if needed. (Kay Kay, Noble Paul, shalin)

48. SOLR-1124: Add a top() function query that causes it's argument to
    have it's values derived from the top level IndexReader, even when
    invoked from a sub-reader.  top() is implicitly used for the
    ord() and rord() functions.  (yonik)

49. SOLR-1110: Support sorting on trie fields with Distributed Search. (Mark Miller, Uwe Schindler via shalin)

50. SOLR-1121: CoreAdminhandler should not need a core  . This makes it possible to start a Solr server w/o a core .(noble)

51. SOLR-769: Added support for clustering in contrib/clustering.  See http://wiki.apache.org/solr/ClusteringComponent for more info.  (gsingers, Stanislaw Osinski)

    (Michael Ludwig, shalin)

58. SOLR-1189: Support providing username and password for basic HTTP authentication in Java replication
    (Matthew Gregg, shalin)
    
59. SOLR-243: Add configurable IndexReaderFactory so that alternate IndexReader implementations 
    can be specified via solrconfig.xml. Note that using a custom IndexReader may be incompatible
    with ReplicationHandler (see comments in SOLR-1366). This should be treated as an experimental feature.
    (Andrzej Bialecki, hossman, Mark Miller, John Wang)
    
60. SOLR-1214: differentiate between solr home and instanceDir .deprecates the method SolrResourceLoader#locateInstanceDir()
    and it is renamed to locateSolrHome (noble)

62. SOLR-1145: Add capability to specify an infoStream log file for the underlying Lucene IndexWriter in solrconfig.xml.
    This is an advanced debug log file that can be used to aid developers in fixing IndexWriter bugs. See the commented
    out example in the example solrconfig.xml under the indexDefaults section. 
	  (Chris Harris, Mark Miller)

63. SOLR-1256: Show the output of CharFilters in analysis.jsp. (koji)

    (Robert Muir via yonik)

65. SOLR-1237: firstSearcher and newSearcher can now be identified via the CommonParams.EVENT (evt) parameter 
    in a request.  This allows a RequestHandler or SearchComponent to know when a newSearcher or firstSearcher 
    event happened.  QuerySenderListender is the only implementation in Solr that implements this, but outside 
    implementations may wish to.  See the AbstractSolrEventListener for a helper method. (gsingers)

66. SOLR-1343: Added HTMLStripCharFilter and marked HTMLStripReader, HTMLStripWhitespaceTokenizerFactory and
    HTMLStripStandardTokenizerFactory deprecated. To strip HTML tags, HTMLStripCharFilter can be used
    with an arbitrary Tokenizer. (koji)

    speeding up phrase queries containing common words by indexing
    n-grams and using them at query time. 
    (Tom Burton-West, Jason Rutherglen via yonik)
    
81. SOLR-1292: Add FieldCache introspection to stats.jsp and JMX Monitoring via
    a new SolrFieldCacheMBean.  (hossman)

    Controllable via the facet.method parameter - "fc" is the new default method and "enum"
    is the original method.  (yonik)

 4. SOLR-970: Use an ArrayList in SolrPluginUtils.parseQueryStrings
    since we know exactly how long the List will be in advance.
    (Kay Kay via hossman)

 5. SOLR-1002: Change SolrIndexSearcher to use insertWithOverflow

57. SOLR-1360: Prevent PhoneticFilter from producing duplicate tokens. (yonik)

58. SOLR-1371: LukeRequestHandler/schema.jsp errored if schema had no 
    uniqueKey field.  The new test for this also (hopefully) adds some

    effect QueryElevationComponentTest was refactored, and a bug in
    that test was found. (hossman)

59. SOLR-914: General finalize() improvements.  No finalizer delegates
    to the respective close/destroy method w/o first checking if it's
    already been closed/destroyed; if it hasn't a, SEVERE error is
    logged first.  (noble, hossman)

60. SOLR-1362: WordDelimiterFilter had inconsistent behavior when setting
    the position increment of tokens following a token consisting of all
    delimiters, and could additionally lose big position increments.
    (Robert Muir, yonik)

61. SOLR-1091: Jetty's use of CESU-8 for code points outside the BMP
    resulted in invalid output from the serialized PHP writer. (yonik)

    (Anders Melchiorsen, koji)

64. SOLR-1400: Properly handle zero-length tokens in TrimFilter.  This
    was not a bug in any released version. (Peter Wolanin, gsingers) 

65. SOLR-1071: spellcheck.extendedResults returns an invalid JSON response
    when count > 1.  To fix, the extendedResults format was changed.
    (Uri Boness, yonik)

66. SOLR-1381: Fixed improper handling of fields that have only term positions and not term offsets during Highlighting (Thorsten Fischer, gsingers)

67. SOLR-1427: Fixed registry.jsp issue with MBeans (gsingers) 

68. SOLR-1468: SolrJ's XML response parsing threw an exception for null
     names, such as those produced when facet.missing=true (yonik)

69. SOLR-1471: Fixed issue with calculating missing values for facets in single valued cases in Stats Component.
  This is not correctly calculated for the multivalued case. (James Miller, gsingers)

70. SOLR-1481: Fixed omitHeader parameter for PHP ResponseWriter.  (Jun Ohtani via billa)

71. SOLR-1448: Add weblogic.xml to solr webapp to enable correct operation in
    WebLogic. (Ilan Rabinovitch via yonik)

72. SOLR-1504: empty char mapping can cause ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in analysis.jsp and co.
    (koji)

73. SOLR-1394: HTMLStripCharFilter split tokens that contained entities and
    often calculated offsets incorrectly for entities.
    (Anders Melchiorsen via yonik)

74. SOLR-1517: Admin pages could stall waiting for localhost name resolution
    if reverse DNS wasn't configured; this was changed so the DNS resolution
    is attempted only once the first time an admin page is loaded.
    (hossman)

75. SOLR-1529: More than 8 deleteByQuery commands in a single request
    caused an error to be returned, although the deletes were
    still executed.  (asmodean via yonik)

    (Wojciech Biela via shalin)

36. SOLR-458: Add equals and hashCode methods to NamedList (Stefan Rinner, shalin) 

37. SOLR-1184: Add option in solrconfig to open a new IndexReader rather than
    using reopen. Done mainly as a fail-safe in the case that a user runs into
    a reopen bug/issue.  (Mark Miller)
    
38. SOLR-1215 use double quotes to enclose attributes in solr.xml (noble)

39. SOLR-1151: add dynamic copy field and maxChars example to example schema.xml.
    (Peter Wolanin, Mark Miller)

40. SOLR-1233: remove /select?qt=/whatever restriction on /-prefixed request handlers.
    (ehatcher)

41. SOLR-1257: logging.jsp has been removed and now passes through to the

    hitting "/admin/logging.jsp" should switch to "/admin/logging".
    (hossman)

42. Upgraded to Lucene 2.9-dev r794238. Other changes include:
    LUCENE-1614 - Use Lucene's DocIdSetIterator.NO_MORE_DOCS as the sentinel value.
    LUCENE-1630 - Add acceptsDocsOutOfOrder method to Collector implementations.
    LUCENE-1673, LUCENE-1701 - Trie has moved to Lucene core and renamed to NumericRangeQuery.

44. Upgraded to Lucene 2.9-dev r801856 (Mark Miller)

45. SOLR1276: Added StatsComponentTest (Rafaï¿½Å‚ Kuï¿½Ä‡, gsingers)

46. SOLR-1377:  The TokenizerFactory API has changed to explicitly return a Tokenizer 
    rather then a TokenStream (that may be or may not be a Tokenizer).  This change 
    is required to take advantage of the Token reuse improvements in lucene 2.9. (ryan)  
    
47. SOLR-1410: Log a warning if the deprecated charset option is used
    on GreekLowerCaseFilterFactory, RussianStemFilterFactory,
    RussianLowerCaseFilterFactory or RussianLetterTokenizerFactory.
    (Robert Muir via hossman)

48. SOLR-1423: Due to LUCENE-1906, Solr's tokenizer should use Tokenizer.correctOffset() instead of CharStream.correctOffset().
    (Uwe Schindler via koji)

49. SOLR-1319, SOLR-1345: Upgrade Solr Highlighter classes to new Lucene Highlighter API. This upgrade has 
    resulted in a back compat break in the DefaultSolrHighlighter class - getQueryScorer is no longer 
    protected. If you happened to be overriding that method in custom code, overide getHighlighter instead. 
    Also, HighlightingUtils#getQueryScorer has been removed as it was deprecated and backcompat has been 
    broken with it anyway.  (Mark Miller)

50. SOLR-1357 SolrInputDocument cannot process dynamic fields (Lars Grote via noble)

    (Mark Miller via shalin)

 6. SOLR-1441: Make it possible to run all tests in a package (shalin)
 

Documentation
----------------------
 1. SOLR-789: The javadoc of RandomSortField is not readable (Nicolas Lalevï¿½Ã�ï¿½e via koji)

 2. SOLR-962: Note about null handling in ModifiableSolrParams.add javadoc
    (Kay Kay via hossman)

 3. SOLR-1409: Added Solr Powered By Logos    

================== Release 1.3.0 ==================

Upgrading from Solr 1.2
-----------------------
IMPORTANT UPGRADE NOTE: In a master/slave configuration, all searchers/slaves
should be upgraded before the master!  If the master were to be updated
first, the older searchers would not be able to read the new index format.

The Porter snowball based stemmers in Lucene were updated (LUCENE-1142),
and are not guaranteed to be backward compatible at the index level
(the stem of certain words may have changed).  Re-indexing is recommended.

Older Apache Solr installations can be upgraded by replacing
the relevant war file with the new version.  No changes to configuration
files should be needed.  

This version of Solr contains a new version of Lucene implementing
an updated index format.  This version of Solr/Lucene can still read
and update indexes in the older formats, and will convert them to the new
format on the first index change.  Be sure to backup your index before 
upgrading in case you need to downgrade.

Solr now recognizes HTTP Request headers related to HTTP Caching (see
RFC 2616 sec13) and will by default respond with "304 Not Modified"
when appropriate.  This should only affect users who access Solr via
an HTTP Cache, or via a Web-browser that has an internal cache, but if
you wish to suppress this behavior an '<httpCaching never304="true"/>'
option can be added to your solrconfig.xml.  See the wiki (or the
example solrconfig.xml) for more details...  
   http://wiki.apache.org/solr/SolrConfigXml#HTTPCaching

In Solr 1.2, DateField did not enforce the canonical representation of
the ISO 8601 format when parsing incoming data, and did not generation
the canonical format when generating dates from "Date Math" strings
(particularly as it pertains to milliseconds ending in trailing zeros)
-- As a result equivalent dates could not always be compared properly.
This problem is corrected in Solr 1.3, but DateField users that might
have been affected by indexing inconsistent formats of equivilent
dates (ie: 1995-12-31T23:59:59Z vs 1995-12-31T23:59:59.000Z) may want
to consider reindexing to correct these inconsistencies.  Users who
depend on some of the the "broken" behavior of DateField in Solr 1.2
(specificly: accepting any input that ends in a 'Z') should consider
using the LegacyDateField class as a possible alternative.  Users that
desire 100% backwards compatibility should consider using the Solr 1.2
version of DateField.

Due to some changes in the lifecycle of TokenFilterFactories, users of
Solr 1.2 who have written Java code which constructs new instances of
StopFilterFactory, SynonymFilterFactory, or EnglishProterFilterFactory
will need to modify their code by adding a line like the following
prior to using the factory object...   
  factory.inform(SolrCore.getSolrCore().getSolrConfig().getResourceLoader()); 
These lifecycle changes do not affect people who use Solr "out of the
box" or who have developed their own TokenFilterFactory plugins. More
info can be found in SOLR-594.

The python client that used to ship with Solr is no longer included in 
the distribution (see client/python/README.txt).
   
Detailed Change List
--------------------

New Features
 1. SOLR-69: Adding MoreLikeThisHandler to search for similar documents using
    lucene contrib/queries MoreLikeThis.  MoreLikeThis is also available from
    the StandardRequestHandler using ?mlt=true. (bdelacretaz, ryan)

 2. SOLR-253: Adding KeepWordFilter and KeepWordFilterFactory.  A TokenFilter
    that keeps tokens with text in the registered keeplist.  This behaves like
    the inverse of StopFilter. (ryan)

 3. SOLR-257: WordDelimiterFilter has a new parameter splitOnCaseChange,
    which can be set to 0 to disable splitting "PowerShot" => "Power" "Shot".
    (klaas)
    
 4. SOLR-193: Adding SolrDocument and SolrInputDocument to represent documents
    outside of the lucene Document infrastructure.  This class will be used 
    by clients and for processing documents. (ryan) 

 5. SOLR-244: Added ModifiableSolrParams - a SolrParams implementation that 
    help you change values after initialization. (ryan)

 6. SOLR-20: Added a java client interface with two implementations.  One 
    implementation uses commons httpclient to connect to solr via HTTP.  The 
    other connects to solr directly.  Check client/java/solrj.  This addition
    also includes tests that start jetty and test a connection using the full
    HTTP request cycle.  (Darren Erik Vengroff, Will Johnson, ryan)
 
 7. SOLR-133: Added StaxUpdateRequestHandler that uses StAX for XML parsing.
    This implementation has much better error checking and lets you configure
    a custom UpdateRequestProcessor that can selectively process update 
    requests depending on the request attributes.  This class will likely 
    replace XmlUpdateRequestHandler.  (Thorsten Scherler, ryan)

 8. SOLR-264: Added RandomSortField, a utility field with a random sort order.
    The seed is based on a hash of the field name, so a dynamic field
    of this type is useful for generating different random sequences.
    This field type should only be used for sorting or as a value source
    in a FunctionQuery (ryan, hossman, yonik) 

 9. SOLR-266: Adding show=schema to LukeRequestHandler to show the parsed
    schema fields and field types.  (ryan)

10. SOLR-133: The UpdateRequestHandler now accepts multiple delete options 
    within a single request.  For example, sending:
     <delete><id>1</id><id>2</id></delete> will delete both 1 and 2. (ryan)

11. SOLR-269: Added UpdateRequestProcessor plugin framework.  This provides
    a reasonable place to process documents after they are parsed and 
    before they are committed to the index.  This is a good place for custom 
    document manipulation or document based authorization. (yonik, ryan)

12. SOLR-260: Converting to a standard PluginLoader framework.  This reworks
    RequestHandlers, FieldTypes, and QueryResponseWriters to share the same
    base code for loading and initializing plugins.  This adds a new 
    configuration option to define the default RequestHandler and 
    QueryResponseWriter in XML using default="true".  (ryan)

13. SOLR-225: Enable pluggable highlighting classes.  Allow configurable
    highlighting formatters and Fragmenters.  (ryan)

14. SOLR-273/376/452/516: Added hl.maxAnalyzedChars highlighting parameter, defaulting 
    to 50k, hl.alternateField, which allows the specification of a backup
    field to use as summary if no keywords are matched, and hl.mergeContiguous,
    which combines fragments if they are adjacent in the source document.
    (klaas, Grant Ingersoll, Koji Sekiguchi via klaas)

15. SOLR-291: Control maximum number of documents to cache for any entry
    in the queryResultCache via queryResultMaxDocsCached solrconfig.xml 
    entry. (Koji Sekiguchi via yonik)

16. SOLR-240: New <lockType> configuration setting in <mainIndex> and
    <indexDefaults> blocks supports all Lucene builtin LockFactories.
    'single' is recommended setting, but 'simple' is default for total
    backwards compatibility.
    (Will Johnson via hossman)
    
17. SOLR-248: Added CapitalizationFilterFactory that creates tokens with 
    normalized capitalization.  This filter is useful for facet display,
    but will not work with a prefix query.  (ryan)
    SOLR-468: Change to the semantics to keep the original token, not the 
    token in the Map.  Also switched to use Lucene's new reusable token 
    capabilities.  (gsingers)

18. SOLR-307: Added NGramFilterFactory and EdgeNGramFilterFactory.
    (Thomas Peuss via Otis Gospodnetic)

19. SOLR-305: analysis.jsp can be given a fieldtype instead of a field
    name.  (hossman)

20. SOLR-102: Added RegexFragmenter, which splits text for highlighting
    based on a given pattern.  (klaas)

21. SOLR-258: Date Faceting added to SimpleFacets.  Facet counts
    computed for ranges of size facet.date.gap (a DateMath expression) 
    between facet.date.start and facet.date.end.  (hossman)

22. SOLR-196: A PHP serialized "phps" response writer that returns a
    serialized array that can be used with the PHP function unserialize,
    and a PHP response writer "php" that may be used by eval.
    (Nick Jenkin, Paul Borgermans, Pieter Berkel via yonik)

23. SOLR-308: A new UUIDField class which accepts UUID string values, 
    as well as the special value of "NEW" which triggers generation of 
    a new random UUID.
    (Thomas Peuss via hossman)

24. SOLR-349: New FunctionQuery functions: sum, product, div, pow, log,
    sqrt, abs, scale, map.  Constants may now be used as a value source.
    (yonik)

25. SOLR-359: Add field type className to Luke response, and enabled access
    to the detailed field information from the solrj client API.
    (Grant Ingersoll via ehatcher)

26. SOLR-334: Pluggable query parsers.  Allows specification of query
    type and arguments as a prefix on a query string. (yonik)

27. SOLR-351: External Value Source.  An external file may be used
     to specify the values of a field, currently usable as
     a ValueSource in a FunctionQuery. (yonik)

28. SOLR-395: Many new features for the spell checker implementation, including
    an extended response mode with much richer output, multi-word spell checking,
    and a bevy of new and renamed options (see the wiki).
    (Mike Krimerman, Scott Taber via klaas).

29. SOLR-408: Added PingRequestHandler and deprecated SolrCore.getPingQueryRequest().
    Ping requests should be configured using standard RequestHandler syntax in
    solrconfig.xml rather then using the <pingQuery></pingQuery> syntax.
    (Karsten Sperling via ryan)

30. SOLR-281: Added a 'Search Component' interface and converted StandardRequestHandler
    and DisMaxRequestHandler to use this framework.  
    (Sharad Agarwal, Henri Biestro, yonik, ryan) 
    
31. SOLR-176: Add detailed timing data to query response output.  The SearchHandler
    interface now returns how long each section takes.  (klaas)
    
32. SOLR-414: Plugin initialization now supports SolrCore and ResourceLoader "Aware" 
    plugins.  Plugins that implement SolrCoreAware or ResourceLoaderAware are 
    informed about the SolrCore/ResourceLoader. (Henri Biestro, ryan)

33. SOLR-350: Support multiple SolrCores running in the same solr instance and allows
    runtime runtime management for any running SolrCore.  If a solr.xml file exists 
    in solr.home, this file is used to instanciate multiple cores and enables runtime 
    core manipulation.  For more informaion see:  http://wiki.apache.org/solr/CoreAdmin  
    (Henri Biestro, ryan)

34. SOLR-447: Added an single request handler that will automatically register all
    standard admin request handlers.  This replaces the need to register (and maintain)
    the set of admin request handlers.  Assuming solrconfig.xml includes:
     <requestHandler name="/admin/" class="org.apache.solr.handler.admin.AdminHandlers" />
    This will register: Luke/SystemInfo/PluginInfo/ThreadDump/PropertiesRequestHandler.
    (ryan)
    
35. SOLR-142: Added RawResponseWriter and ShowFileRequestHandler.  This returns config
    files directly.  If AdminHandlers are configured, this will be added automatically.
    The jsp files /admin/get-file.jsp and /admin/raw-schema.jsp have been deprecated.
    The deprecated <admin><gettableFiles> will be automatically registered with
    a ShowFileRequestHandler instance for backwards compatibility. (ryan)

36. SOLR-446: TextResponseWriter can write SolrDocuments and SolrDocumentLists the 
    same way it writes Document and DocList.  (yonik, ryan)

37. SOLR-418: Adding a query elevation component.  This is an optional component to
    elevate some documents to the top positions (or exclude them) for a given query.
    (ryan)

38. SOLR-478: Added ability to get back unique key information from the LukeRequestHandler. 
    (gsingers)    

39. SOLR-127: HTTP Caching awareness.  Solr now recognizes HTTP Request
    headers related to HTTP Caching (see RFC 2616 sec13) and will respond
    with "304 Not Modified" when appropriate.  New options have been added
    to solrconfig.xml to influence this behavior.
    (Thomas Peuss via hossman)

40. SOLR-303: Distributed Search over HTTP.  Specification of shards
    argument causes Solr to query those shards and merge the results
    into a single response.  Querying, field faceting (sorted only),
    query faceting, highlighting, and debug information are supported
    in distributed mode.
    (Sharad Agarwal, Patrick O'Leary, Sabyasachi Dalal, Stu Hood,
     Jayson Minard, Lars Kotthoff, ryan, yonik)

41. SOLR-356: Pluggable functions (value sources) that allow 
    registration of new functions via solrconfig.xml
    (Doug Daniels via yonik)

42. SOLR-494: Added cool admin Ajaxed schema explorer.
    (Greg Ludington via ehatcher)

43. SOLR-497: Added date faceting to the QueryResponse in SolrJ
    and QueryResponseTest (Shalin Shekhar Mangar via gsingers)

44. SOLR-486: Binary response format, faster and smaller
    than XML and JSON response formats (use wt=javabin).
    BinaryResponseParser for utilizing the binary format via SolrJ
    and is now the default.
    (Noble Paul, yonik)

45. SOLR-521: StopFilterFactory support for "enablePositionIncrements"
    (Walter Ferrara via hossman)

46. SOLR-557: Added SolrCore.getSearchComponents() to return an unmodifiable Map. (gsingers)

47. SOLR-516: Added hl.maxAlternateFieldLength parameter, to set max length for hl.alternateField
    (Koji Sekiguchi via klaas)

48. SOLR-319: Changed SynonymFilterFactory to "tokenize" synonyms file.
    To use a tokenizer, specify "tokenizerFactory" attribute in <filter>.
    For example:
    <tokenizer class="solr.CJKTokenizerFactory"/>
    <filter class="solr.SynonymFilterFactory" synonyms="synonyms.txt" expand="true"
      ignoreCase="true" tokenizerFactory="solr.CJKTokenizerFactory"/>
    (koji)

49. SOLR-515: Added SimilarityFactory capability to schema.xml,
    making config file parameters usable in the construction of
    the global Lucene Similarity implementation.
    (ehatcher)
    
50. SOLR-536: Add a DocumentObjectBinder to solrj that converts Objects to and
    from SolrDocuments.  (Noble Paul via ryan)

51. SOLR-595: Add support for Field level boosting in the MoreLikeThis Handler.  
    (Tom Morton, gsingers)

52. SOLR-572: Added SpellCheckComponent and org.apache.solr.spelling package to support more spell 
    checking functionality.  Also includes ability to add your own SolrSpellChecker implementation that
    plugs in.  See http://wiki.apache.org/solr/SpellCheckComponent for more details
    (Shalin Shekhar Mangar, Bojan Smid, gsingers)

53. SOLR-679: Added accessor methods to Lucene based spell checkers (gsingers)

54. SOLR-423: Added Request Handler close hook notification so that RequestHandlers can be notified 
    when a core is closing.  (gsingers, ryan)

55. SOLR-603: Added ability to partially optimize. (gsingers)

56. SOLR-483: Add byte/short sorting support (gsingers)

57. SOLR-14: Add preserveOriginal flag to WordDelimiterFilter
    (Geoffrey Young, Trey Hyde, Ankur Madnani, yonik)

58. SOLR-502: Add search timeout support. (Sean Timm via yonik)
    
59. SOLR-605: Add the ability to register callbacks programatically (ryan, Noble Paul)

60. SOLR-610: hl.maxAnalyzedChars can be -1 to highlight everything (Lars Kotthoff via klaas)

61. SOLR-522: Make analysis.jsp show payloads. (Tricia Williams via yonik)

62. SOLR-611: Expose sort_values returned by QueryComponent in SolrJ's QueryResponse 
    (Dan Rosher via shalin)

63. SOLR-256: Support exposing Solr statistics through JMX (Sharad Agrawal, shalin)

64. SOLR-666: Expose warmup time in statistics for SolrIndexSearcher and LRUCache (shalin)

65. SOLR-663: Allow multiple files for stopwords, keepwords, protwords and synonyms 
    (Otis Gospodnetic, shalin)

66. SOLR-469: Added DataImportHandler as a contrib project which makes indexing data from Databases, 
    XML files and HTTP data sources into Solr quick and easy. Includes API and implementations for
    supporting multiple data sources, processors and transformers for importing data. Supports full 
    data imports as well as incremental (delta) indexing. See http://wiki.apache.org/solr/DataImportHandler
    for more details. (Noble Paul, shalin)

67. SOLR-622: SpellCheckComponent supports auto-loading indices on startup and optionally, (re)builds
    indices on newSearcher event, if configured in solrconfig.xml (shalin)

68. SOLR-554: Hierarchical JDK log level selector for SOLR Admin replaces logging.jsp 
    (Sean Timm via shalin)

69. SOLR-506: Emitting HTTP Cache headers can be enabled or disabled through configuration on a 
    per-handler basis (shalin)

70. SOLR-716: Added support for properties in configuration files. Properties can be specified in 
    solr.xml and can be used in solrconfig.xml and schema.xml (Henri Biestro, hossman, ryan, shalin)

71. SOLR-1129 : Support binding dynamic fields to beans in SolrJ (Avlesh Singh , noble)

72. SOLR-920 : Cache and reuse IndexSchema . A new attribute added in solr.xml called 'shareSchema' (noble)
    
Changes in runtime behavior
 1. SOLR-559: use Lucene updateDocument, deleteDocuments methods.  This
    removes the maxBufferedDeletes parameter added by SOLR-310 as Lucene
    now manages the deletes.  This provides slightly better indexing 
    performance and makes overwrites atomic, eliminating the possibility of
    a crash causing duplicates. (yonik)

 2. SOLR-689 / SOLR-695: If you have used "MultiCore" functionality in an unreleased
    version of 1.3-dev, many classes and configs have been renamed for the official 
    1.3 release.  Speciffically, solr.xml has replaced multicore.xml, and uses a slightly 
    different syntax.  The solrj classes: MultiCore{Request/Response/Params} have been 
    renamed:  CoreAdmin{Request/Response/Params}  (hossman, ryan, Henri Biestro)

 3. SOLR-647: reference count the SolrCore uses to prevent a premature
    close while a core is still in use.  (Henri Biestro, Noble Paul, yonik)

 4. SOLR-737: SolrQueryParser now uses a ConstantScoreQuery for wildcard
    queries that prevent an exception from being thrown when the number
    of matching terms exceeds the BooleanQuery clause limit.  (yonik)
    
Optimizations
 1. SOLR-276: improve JSON writer speed. (yonik)
 
 2. SOLR-310: bound and reduce memory usage by providing <maxBufferedDeletes> parameter,
    which flushes deleted without forcing the user to use <commit/> for this purpose.
    (klaas) 

 3. SOLR-348: short-circuit faceting if less than mincount docs match. (yonik)

 4. SOLR-354: Optimize removing all documents.  Now when a delete by query
    of *:* is issued, the current index is removed. (yonik)

 5. SOLR-377: Speed up response writers. (yonik)

 6. SOLR-342:  Added support into the SolrIndexWriter for using several new features of the new
    LuceneIndexWriter, including: setRAMBufferSizeMB(), setMergePolicy(), setMergeScheduler.  
    Also, added support to specify Lucene's autoCommit functionality (not to be confused with Solr's
    similarily named autoCommit functionality) via the <luceneAutoCommit> config. item.  See the test 
    and example solrconfig.xml <indexDefaults> section for usage.  Performance during indexing should 
    be significantly increased by moving up to 2.3 due to Lucene's new indexing capabilities.  
    Furthermore, the setRAMBufferSizeMB makes it more logical to decide on tuning factors related to
    indexing.  For best performance, leave the mergePolicy and mergeScheduler as the defaults and set
    ramBufferSizeMB instead of maxBufferedDocs.  The best value for this depends on the types of 
    documents in use.  32 should be a good starting point, but reports have shown up to 48 MB provides
    good results. Note, it is acceptable to set both ramBufferSizeMB and maxBufferedDocs, and Lucene 
    will flush based on whichever limit is reached first. (gsingers)
    
 7. SOLR-330: Converted TokenStreams to use Lucene's new char array based
    capabilities. (gsingers)

 8. SOLR-624: Only take snapshots if there are differences to the index (Richard Trey Hyde via gsingers)

 9. SOLR-587: Delete by Query performance greatly improved by using
    new underlying Lucene IndexWriter implementation.  (yonik)

10. SOLR-730: Use read-only IndexReaders that don't synchronize
    isDeleted().  This will speed up function queries and *:* queries
    as well as improve their scalability on multi-CPU systems.
    (Mark Miller via yonik)

Bug Fixes

 7. SOLR-331: Fix WordDelimiterFilter handling of offsets for synonyms or 
    other injected tokens that can break highlighting. (yonik)

 8. SOLR-282: Snapshooter does not work on Solaris and OS X since the cp command
    there does not have the -l option.  Also updated commit/optimize related
    scripts to handle both old and new response format.  (bill)

 9. SOLR-294: Logging of elapsed time broken on Solaris because the date command
    there does not support the %s output format.  (bill)

10. SOLR-136: Snappuller - "date -d" and locales don't mix.  (Jï¿½Ã�ï¿½rgen Hermann via    bill)

11. SOLR-333: Changed distributiondump.jsp to use Solr HOME instead of CWD to set path.
 
12. SOLR-393: Removed duplicate contentType from raw-schema.jsp. (bill)

13. SOLR-413: Requesting a large numbers of documents to be returned (limit)
    can result in an out-of-memory exception, even for a small index. (yonik)

14. The CSV loader incorrectly threw an exception when given
    header=true (the default).  (ryan, yonik)

15. SOLR-449: the python and ruby response writers are now able to correctly 
    output NaN and Infinity in their respective languages.  (klaas)

16. SOLR-42: HTMLStripReader tokenizers now preserve correct source
    offsets for highlighting.  (Grant Ingersoll via yonik)

    specified and there is no defaultSearchField in schema.xml
    (Lars Kotthoff via hossman)

22. SOLR-530: Better error messages/warnings when parsing schema.xml:
    field using bogus fieldtype and multiple copyFields to a non-multiValue
    field.  (Shalin Shekhar Mangar via hossman)

23. SOLR-528: Better error message when defaultSearchField is bogus or not
    indexed.  (Lars Kotthoff via hossman)

24. SOLR-533: Fixed tests so they don't use hardcoded port numbers. 
    (hossman)

25. SOLR-400: SolrExceptionTest should now handle using OpenDNS as a DNS provider (gsingers)

26. SOLR-541: Legacy XML update support (provided by SolrUpdateServlet
    when no RequestHandler is mapped to "/update") now logs error correctly.
    (hossman)

27. SOLR-267: Changed logging to report number of hits, and also provide a mechanism to add log 
    messages to be output by the SolrCore via a NamedList toLog member variable.  
    (Will Johnson, yseeley, gsingers)
    
    SOLR-267: Removed adding values to the HTTP headers in SolrDispatchFilter (gsingers)

28. SOLR-509: Moved firstSearcher event notification to the end of the SolrCore constructor 
    (Koji Sekiguchi via gsingers)

29. SOLR-470, SOLR-552, SOLR-544, SOLR-701: Multiple fixes to DateField

    been added for people who have come to depend on the existing
    broken behavior. (hossman, Stefan Oestreicher)

30. SOLR-539: Fix for non-atomic long counters and a cast fix to avoid divide
    by zero. (Sean Timm via Otis Gospodnetic)

    hl.usePhraseHighligher=true URL param is used.
    (Bojan Smid via Otis Gospodnetic)

34. SOLR-590: Limitation in pgrep on Linux platform breaks script-utils fixUser.    
    (Hannes Schmidt via billa)

35. SOLR-597: SolrServlet no longer "caches" SolrCore.  This was causing
    problems in Resin, and could potentially cause problems for customized
    usages of SolrServlet.

36. SOLR-585: Now sets the QParser on the ResponseBuilder (gsingers)

37. SOLR-604: If the spellchecking path is relative, make it relative to the Solr Data Directory.  
    (Shalin Shekhar Mangar via gsingers)

38. SOLR-584: Make stats.jsp and stats.xsl more robust.
    (Yousef Ourabi and hossman)

39. SOLR-443: SolrJ: Declare UTF-8 charset on POSTed parameters
    to avoid problems with servlet containers that default to latin-1
    and allow switching of the exact POST mechanism for parameters
    via useMultiPartPost in CommonsHttpSolrServer.
    (Lars Kotthoff, Andrew Schurman, ryan, yonik)

40. SOLR-556: multi-valued fields always highlighted in disparate snippets 
    (Lars Kotthoff via klaas)

41. SOLR-501: Fix admin/analysis.jsp UTF-8 input for some other servlet
    containers such as Tomcat. (Hiroaki Kawai, Lars Kotthoff via yonik)
    
42. SOLR-616: SpellChecker accuracy configuration is not applied for FileBasedSpellChecker.
    Apply it for FileBasedSpellChecker and IndexBasedSpellChecker both.
    (shalin)
    
43. SOLR-648: SpellCheckComponent throws NullPointerException on using spellcheck.q request
    parameter after restarting Solr, if reload is called but build is not called.
    (Jonathan Lee, shalin)

44. SOLR-598: DebugComponent now always occurs last in the SearchHandler list unless the 
    components are explicitly declared. (gsingers)

45. SOLR-676: DataImportHandler should use UpdateRequestProcessor API instead of directly 
    using UpdateHandler. (shalin)

46. SOLR-696: Fixed bug in NamedListCodec in regards to serializing Iterable objects.  (gsingers)

47. SOLR-669: snappuler fix for FreeBSD/Darwin (Richard "Trey" Hyde via Otis Gospodnetic)

 1. SOLR-135: Moved common classes to org.apache.solr.common and altered the
    build scripts to make two jars: apache-solr-1.3.jar and 
    apache-solr-1.3-common.jar.  This common.jar can be used in client code; 
    It does not have lucene or junit dependencies.  The original classes
    have been replaced with a @Deprecated extended class and are scheduled
    to be removed in a later release.  While this change does not affect API
    compatibility, it is recommended to update references to these
    deprecated classes.  (ryan)

              client and contrib. The target can publish artifacts with source and javadocs.
              (Spencer Crissman, Craig McClanahan, shalin)

================== Release 1.2 ==================

Upgrading from Solr 1.1
-------------------------------------
IMPORTANT UPGRADE NOTE: In a master/slave configuration, all searchers/slaves
should be upgraded before the master!  If the master were to be updated
first, the older searchers would not be able to read the new index format.

Older Apache Solr installations can be upgraded by replacing
the relevant war file with the new version.  No changes to configuration
files should be needed.  

This version of Solr contains a new version of Lucene implementing
an updated index format.  This version of Solr/Lucene can still read
and update indexes in the older formats, and will convert them to the new
format on the first index change.  One change in the new index format 
is that all "norms" are kept in a single file, greatly reducing the number
of files per segment. Users of compound file indexes will want to consider
converting to the non-compound format for faster indexing and slightly better
search concurrency.

The JSON response format for facets has changed to make it easier for
clients to retain sorted order.  Use json.nl=map explicitly in clients
to get the old behavior, or add it as a default to the request handler
in solrconfig.xml

The Lucene based Solr query syntax is slightly more strict.
A ':' in a field value must be escaped or the whole value must be quoted.

The Solr "Request Handler" framework has been updated in two key ways:
First, if a Request Handler is registered in solrconfig.xml with a name
starting with "/" then it can be accessed using path-based URL, instead of
using the legacy "/select?qt=name" URL structure.  Second, the Request
Handler framework has been extended making it possible to write Request
Handlers that process streams of data for doing updates, and there is a
new-style Request Handler for XML updates given the name of "/update" in
the example solrconfig.xml.  Existing installations without this "/update"
handler will continue to use the old update servlet and should see no
changes in behavior.  For new-style update handlers, errors are now
reflected in the HTTP status code, Content-type checking is more strict,
and the response format has changed and is controllable via the wt
parameter.



Detailed Change List
--------------------

New Features
 1. SOLR-82: Default field values can be specified in the schema.xml.
    (Ryan McKinley via hossman)

 2. SOLR-89: Two new TokenFilters with corresponding Factories...
    * TrimFilter - Trims leading and trailing whitespace from Tokens
    * PatternReplaceFilter - applies a Pattern to each token in the
      stream, replacing match occurances with a specified replacement.
    (hossman)

 3. SOLR-91: allow configuration of a limit of the number of searchers 
    that can be warming in the background.  This can be used to avoid
    out-of-memory errors, or contention caused by more and more searchers
    warming in the background.  An error is thrown if the limit specified
    by maxWarmingSearchers in solrconfig.xml is exceeded. (yonik)

 4. SOLR-106: New faceting parameters that allow specification of a
    minimum count for returned facets (facet.mincount), paging through facets
    (facet.offset, facet.limit), and explicit sorting (facet.sort).
    facet.zeros is now deprecated.  (yonik)

 5. SOLR-80: Negative queries are now allowed everywhere.  Negative queries
    are generated and cached as their positive counterpart, speeding
    generation and generally resulting in smaller sets to cache.
    Set intersections in SolrIndexSearcher are more efficient,
    starting with the smallest positive set, subtracting all negative
    sets, then intersecting with all other positive sets.  (yonik)

 6. SOLR-117: Limit a field faceting to constraints with a prefix specified
    by facet.prefix or f.<field>.facet.prefix. (yonik)

 7. SOLR-107: JAVA API: Change NamedList to use Java5 generics
    and implement Iterable<Map.Entry> (Ryan McKinley via yonik)

 8. SOLR-104: Support for "Update Plugins" -- RequestHandlers that want
    access to streams of data for doing updates.  ContentStreams can come
    from the raw POST body, multi-part form data, or remote URLs.
    Included in this change is a new SolrDispatchFilter that allows
    RequestHandlers registered with names that begin with a "/" to be
    accessed using a URL structure based on that name.
    (Ryan McKinley via hossman)

 9. SOLR-126: DirectUpdateHandler2 supports autocommitting after a specified time
    (in ms), using <autoCommit><maxTime>10000</maxTime></autoCommit>.
    (Ryan McKinley via klaas).

10. SOLR-116: IndexInfoRequestHandler added. (Erik Hatcher)

11. SOLR-79: Add system property ${<sys.prop>[:<default>]} substitution for
    configuration files loaded, including schema.xml and solrconfig.xml.
    (Erik Hatcher with inspiration from Andrew Saar)

12. SOLR-149: Changes to make Solr more easily embeddable, in addition
    to logging which request handler handled each request.
    (Ryan McKinley via yonik)

13. SOLR-86: Added standalone Java-based command-line updater.
    (Erik Hatcher via Bertrand Delecretaz)

14. SOLR-152: DisMaxRequestHandler now supports configurable alternate
    behavior when q is not specified.  A "q.alt" param can be specified
    using SolrQueryParser syntax as a mechanism for specifying what query
    the dismax handler should execute if the main user query (q) is blank.
    (Ryan McKinley via hossman)

15. SOLR-158: new "qs" (Query Slop) param for DisMaxRequestHandler
    allows for specifying the amount of default slop to use when parsing
    explicit phrase queries from the user.
    (Adam Hiatt via hossman)

16. SOLR-81: SpellCheckerRequestHandler that uses the SpellChecker from
    the Lucene contrib.
    (Otis Gospodnetic and Adam Hiatt)    

17. SOLR-182: allow lazy loading of request handlers on first request.
    (Ryan McKinley via yonik)

18. SOLR-81: More SpellCheckerRequestHandler enhancements, inlcluding
    support for relative or absolute directory path configurations, as
    well as RAM based directory. (hossman)   

19. SOLR-197: New parameters for input: stream.contentType for specifying
    or overriding the content type of input, and stream.file for reading
    local files. (Ryan McKinley via yonik)

20. SOLR-66: CSV data format for document additions and updates. (yonik)

21. SOLR-184: add echoHandler=true to responseHeader, support echoParams=all
    (Ryan McKinley via ehatcher)
    
22. SOLR-211: Added a regex PatternTokenizerFactory.  This extracts tokens 
    from the input string using a regex Pattern. (Ryan McKinley)
    
23. SOLR-162: Added a "Luke" request handler and other admin helpers.
    This exposes the system status through the standard requestHandler
    framework. (ryan)
    
24. SOLR-212: Added a DirectSolrConnection class.  This lets you access
    solr using the standard request/response formats, but does not require
    an HTTP connection.  It is designed for embedded applications. (ryan)    

25. SOLR-204: The request dispatcher (added in SOLR-104) can handle
    calls to /select.  This offers uniform error handling for /update and 
    /select.  To enable this behavior, you must add:
      <requestDispatcher handleSelect="true" > to your solrconfig.xml
    See the example solrconfig.xml for details.  (ryan)

26. SOLR-170: StandardRequestHandler now supports a "sort" parameter.
    Using the ';' syntax is still supported, but it is recommended to 
    transition to the new syntax. (ryan)

27. SOLR-181: The index schema now supports "required" fields.  Attempts
    to add a document without a required field will fail, returning a
    descriptive error message.  By default, the uniqueKey field is
    a required field.  This can be disabled by setting required=false
    in schema.xml.  (Greg Ludington via ryan)

28. SOLR-217: Fields configured in the schema to be neither indexed or
    stored will now be quietly ignored by Solr when Documents are added.
    The example schema has a comment explaining how this can be used to
    ignore any "unknown" fields.
    (Will Johnson via hossman)

29. SOLR-227: If schema.xml defines multiple fieldTypes, fields, or 
    dynamicFields with the same name, a severe error will be logged rather 
    then quietly continuing. Depending on the <abortOnConfigurationError> 
    settings, this may halt the server.  Likewise, if solrconfig.xml 
    defines multiple RequestHandlers with the same name it will also add
    an error.  (ryan)

30. SOLR-226: Added support for dynamic field as the destination of a 
    copyField using glob (*) replacement. (ryan)
    
31. SOLR-224: Adding a PhoneticFilterFactory that uses apache commons codec
    language encoders to build phonetically similar tokens.  This currently
    supports: DoubleMetaphone, Metaphone, Soundex, and RefinedSoundex (ryan)

32. SOLR-199: new n-gram tokenizers available via NGramTokenizerFactory 
    and EdgeNGramTokenizerFactory. (Adam Hiatt via yonik)

33. SOLR-234: TrimFilter can update the Token's startOffset and endOffset 
    if updateOffsets="true".  By default the Token offsets are unchanged.
    (ryan)

34. SOLR-208: new example_rss.xsl and example_atom.xsl to provide more
    examples for people about the Solr XML response format and how they
    can transform it to suit different needs.
    (Brian Whitman via hossman)

35. SOLR-249: Deprecated SolrException( int, ... ) constructors in favor 
    of constructors that takes an ErrorCode enum.  This will ensure that
    all SolrExceptions use a valid HTTP status code. (ryan)
    
36. SOLR-386: Abstracted SolrHighlighter and moved existing implementation
    to DefaultSolrHighlighter.  Adjusted SolrCore and solrconfig.xml so 
    that highlighter is configurable via a class attribute.  Allows users 
    to use their own highlighter implementation. (Tricia Williams via klaas)
        
Changes in runtime behavior
 1. Highlighting using DisMax will only pick up terms from the main 
    user query, not boost or filter queries (klaas).

 2. SOLR-125: Change default of json.nl to flat, change so that
    json.nl only affects items where order matters (facet constraint
    listings).  Fix JSON output bug for null values.  Internal JAVA API:
    change most uses of NamedList to SimpleOrderedMap. (yonik)

 3. A new method "getSolrQueryParser" has been added to the IndexSchema
    class for retrieving a new SolrQueryParser instance with all options
    specified in the schema.xml's <solrQueryParser> block set.  The
    documentation for the SolrQueryParser constructor and it's use of
    IndexSchema have also been clarified.
    (Erik Hatcher and hossman)

 4. DisMaxRequestHandler's bq, bf, qf, and pf parameters can now accept
    multiple values (klaas).

 5. Query are re-written before highlighting is performed.  This enables
    proper highlighting of prefix and wildcard queries (klaas).

 6. A meaningful exception is raised when attempting to add a doc missing 
    a unique id if it is declared in the schema and allowDups=false.
    (ryan via klaas)

 7. SOLR-183: Exceptions with error code 400 are raised when
    numeric argument parsing fails.  RequiredSolrParams class added
    to facilitate checking for parameters that must be present.
    (Ryan McKinley, J.J. Larrea via yonik)

 8. SOLR-179: By default, solr will abort after any severe initalization
    errors.  This behavior can be disabled by setting:
    <abortOnConfigurationError>false</abortOnConfigurationError>
    in solrconfig.xml (ryan)

 9. The example solrconfig.xml maps /update to XmlUpdateRequestHandler using 
    the new request dispatcher (SOLR-104).  This requires posted content to 
    have a valid contentType: curl -H 'Content-type:text/xml; charset=utf-8' 
    The response format matches that of /select and returns standard error 
    codes.  To enable solr1.1 style /update, do not map "/update" to any 
    handler in solrconfig.xml (ryan)

10. SOLR-231: If a charset is not specified in the contentType, 
    ContentStream.getReader() will use UTF-8 encoding.  (ryan)

11. SOLR-230: More options for post.jar to support stdin, xml on the
    commandline, and defering commits.  Tutorial modified to take
    advantage of these options so there is no need for curl.
    (hossman)

12. SOLR-128: Upgraded Jetty to the latest stable release 6.1.3 (ryan)
    
Optimizations 
 1. SOLR-114: HashDocSet specific implementations of union() and andNot()
    for a 20x performance improvement for those set operations, and a new
    hash algorithm speeds up exists() by 10% and intersectionSize() by 8%.
    (yonik)
   
 2. SOLR-115: Solr now uses BooleanQuery.clauses() instead of
    BooleanQuery.getClauses() in any situation where there is no risk of
    modifying the original query.
    (hossman)

 3. SOLR-221: Speed up sorted faceting on multivalued fields by ~60%
    when the base set consists of a relatively large portion of the
    index. (yonik)

 4. SOLR-221: Added a facet.enum.cache.minDf parameter which avoids
    using the filterCache for terms that match few documents, trading
    decreased memory usage for increased query time. (yonik)

Bug Fixes
 1. SOLR-87: Parsing of synonym files did not correctly handle escaped
    whitespace such as \r\n\t\b\f. (yonik)

 2. SOLR-92: DOMUtils.getText (used when parsing config files) did not 
    work properly with many DOM implementations when dealing with 
    "Attributes". (Ryan McKinley via hossman)

 3. SOLR-9,SOLR-99: Tighten up sort specification error checking, throw
    exceptions for missing sort specifications or a sort on a non-indexed
    field. (Ryan McKinley via yonik)
    
 4. SOLR-145: Fix for bug introduced in SOLR-104 where some Exceptions
    were being ignored by all "out of the box" RequestHandlers. (hossman)
      
 5. SOLR-166: JNDI solr.home code refactoring.  SOLR-104 moved
    some JNDI related code to the init method of a Servlet Filter -
    according to the Servlet Spec, all Filter's should be initialized
    prior to initializing any Servlets, but this is not the case in at
    least one Servlet Container (Resin).  This "bug fix" refactors
    this JNDI code so that it should be executed the first time any
    attempt is made to use the solr.home dir.
    (Ryan McKinley via hossman)

 6. SOLR-173: Bug fix to SolrDispatchFilter to reduce "too many open
    files" problem was that SolrDispatchFilter was not closing requests
    when finished.  Also modified ResponseWriters to only fetch a Searcher
    reference if necessary for writing out DocLists.
    (Ryan McKinley via hossman)

 7. SOLR-168: Fix display positioning of multiple tokens at the same
    position in analysis.jsp (yonik)

 8. SOLR-167: The SynonymFilter sometimes generated incorrect offsets when
    multi token synonyms were mached in the source text. (yonik) 

 9. SOLR-188: bin scripts do not support non-default webapp names.  Added "-U"
    option to specify a full path to the update url, overriding the
    "-h" (hostname), "-p" (port) and "-w" (webapp name) parameters.
    (Jeff Rodenburg via billa)

10. SOLR-198: RunExecutableListener always waited for the process to
    finish, even when wait="false" was set. (Koji Sekiguchi via yonik)

11. SOLR-207: Changed distribution scripts to remove recursive find
    and avoid use of "find -maxdepth" on platforms where it is not
    supported. (yonik)

12. SOLR-222: Changing writeLockTimeout in solrconfig.xml did not
    change the effective timeout. (Koji Sekiguchi via yonik)

13. Changed the SOLR-104 RequestDispatcher so that /select?qt=xxx can not 
    access handlers that start with "/".  This makes path based authentication
    possible for path based request handlers.  (ryan)

14. SOLR-214: Some servlet containers (including Tomcat and Resin) do not
    obey the specified charset.  Rather then letting the the container handle 
    it solr now uses the charset from the header contentType to decode posted
    content.  Using the contentType: "text/xml; charset=utf-8" will force
    utf-8 encoding.  If you do not specify a contentType, it will use the 
    platform default.  (Koji Sekiguchi via ryan)

15. SOLR-241: Undefined system properties used in configuration files now
    cause a clear message to be logged rather than an obscure exception thrown.
    (Koji Sekiguchi via ehatcher) 

Other Changes
 1. Updated to Lucene 2.1

 2. Updated to Lucene 2007-05-20_00-04-53

================== Release 1.1.0 ==================

Status
------
This is the first release since Solr joined the Incubator, and brings many
new features and performance optimizations including highlighting,
faceted browsing, and JSON/Python/Ruby response formats.


Upgrading from previous Solr versions
-------------------------------------
Older Apache Solr installations can be upgraded by replacing
the relevant war file with the new version.  No changes to configuration
files are needed and the index format has not changed.

The default version of the Solr XML response syntax has been changed to 2.2.
Behavior can be preserved for those clients not explicitly specifying a 
version by adding a default to the request handler in solrconfig.xml

By default, Solr will no longer use a searcher that has not fully warmed,
and requests will block in the meantime.  To change back to the previous
behavior of using a cold searcher in the event there is no other
warm searcher, see the useColdSearcher config item in solrconfig.xml

The XML response format when adding multiple documents to the collection
in a single <add> command has changed to return a single <result>.


Detailed Change List
--------------------

New Features
 1. added support for setting Lucene's positionIncrementGap
 2. Admin: new statistics for SolrIndexSearcher
 3. Admin: caches now show config params on stats page
 3. max() function added to FunctionQuery suite
 4. postOptimize hook, mirroring the functionallity of the postCommit hook,
    but only called on an index optimize.
 5. Ability to HTTP POST query requests to /select in addition to HTTP-GET
 6. The default search field may now be overridden by requests to the
    standard request handler using the df query parameter. (Erik Hatcher)
 7. Added DisMaxRequestHandler and SolrPluginUtils. (Chris Hostetter)
 8. Support for customizing the QueryResponseWriter per request
    (Mike Baranczak / SOLR-16 / hossman)
 9. Added KeywordTokenizerFactory (hossman)
10. copyField accepts dynamicfield-like names as the source.
    (Darren Erik Vengroff via yonik, SOLR-21)
11. new DocSet.andNot(), DocSet.andNotSize() (yonik)
12. Ability to store term vectors for fields. (Mike Klaas via yonik, SOLR-23)
13. New abstract BufferedTokenStream for people who want to write
    Tokenizers or TokenFilters that require arbitrary buffering of the
    stream. (SOLR-11 / yonik, hossman)
14. New RemoveDuplicatesToken - useful in situations where
    synonyms, stemming, or word-deliminater-ing produce identical tokens at
    the same position. (SOLR-11 / yonik, hossman)
15. Added highlighting to SolrPluginUtils and implemented in StandardRequestHandler
    and DisMaxRequestHandler (SOLR-24 / Mike Klaas via hossman,yonik)
16. SnowballPorterFilterFactory language is configurable via the "language"
    attribute, with the default being "English".  (Bertrand Delacretaz via yonik, SOLR-27)
17. ISOLatin1AccentFilterFactory, instantiates ISOLatin1AccentFilter to remove accents.
    (Bertrand Delacretaz via yonik, SOLR-28)
18. JSON, Python, Ruby QueryResponseWriters: use wt="json", "python" or "ruby"
    (yonik, SOLR-31)
19. Make web admin pages return UTF-8, change Content-type declaration to include a
    space between the mime-type and charset (Philip Jacob, SOLR-35)
20. Made query parser default operator configurable via schema.xml:
         <solrQueryParser defaultOperator="AND|OR"/>
    The default operator remains "OR".
21. JAVA API: new version of SolrIndexSearcher.getDocListAndSet() which takes
    flags (Greg Ludington via yonik, SOLR-39)
22. A HyphenatedWordsFilter, a text analysis filter used during indexing to rejoin
    words that were hyphenated and split by a newline. (Boris Vitez via yonik, SOLR-41)
23. Added a CompressableField base class which allows fields of derived types to
    be compressed using the compress=true setting.  The field type also gains the
    ability to specify a size threshold at which field data is compressed.
    (klaas, SOLR-45)
24. Simple faceted search support for fields (enumerating terms)
    and arbitrary queries added to both StandardRequestHandler and
    DisMaxRequestHandler. (hossman, SOLR-44)
25. In addition to specifying default RequestHandler params in the
    solrconfig.xml, support has been added for configuring values to be
    appended to the multi-val request params, as well as for configuring
    invariant params that can not overridden in the query. (hossman, SOLR-46)
26. Default operator for query parsing can now be specified with q.op=AND|OR
    from the client request, overriding the schema value. (ehatcher)
27. New XSLTResponseWriter does server side XSLT processing of XML Response.
    In the process, an init(NamedList) method was added to QueryResponseWriter
    which works the same way as SolrRequestHandler.
    (Bertrand Delacretaz / SOLR-49 / hossman)
28. json.wrf parameter adds a wrapper-function around the JSON response,
    useful in AJAX with dynamic script tags for specifying a JavaScript
    callback function. (Bertrand Delacretaz via yonik, SOLR-56)
29. autoCommit can be specified every so many documents added (klaas, SOLR-65)
30. ${solr.home}/lib directory can now be used for specifying "plugin" jars
    (hossman, SOLR-68)
31. Support for "Date Math" relative "NOW" when specifying values of a
    DateField in a query -- or when adding a document.
    (hossman, SOLR-71)
32. useColdSearcher control in solrconfig.xml prevents the first searcher
    from being used before it's done warming.  This can help prevent
    thrashing on startup when multiple requests hit a cold searcher.
    The default is "false", preventing use before warm. (yonik, SOLR-77)
    
Changes in runtime behavior
 1. classes reorganized into different packages, package names changed to Apache
 2. force read of document stored fields in QuerySenderListener
 3. Solr now looks in ./solr/conf for config, ./solr/data for data
    configurable via solr.solr.home system property
 4. Highlighter params changed to be prefixed with "hl."; allow fragmentsize
    customization and per-field overrides on many options 
    (Andrew May via klaas, SOLR-37)
 5. Default param values for DisMaxRequestHandler should now be specified
    using a '<lst name="defaults">...</lst>' init param, for backwards
    compatability all init prams will be used as defaults if an init param
    with that name does not exist. (hossman, SOLR-43)
 6. The DisMaxRequestHandler now supports multiple occurances of the "fq"
    param. (hossman, SOLR-44)
 7. FunctionQuery.explain now uses ComplexExplanation to provide more
    accurate score explanations when composed in a BooleanQuery.
    (hossman, SOLR-25)
 8. Document update handling locking is much sparser, allowing performance gains
    through multiple threads.  Large commits also might be faster (klaas, SOLR-65)
 9. Lazy field loading can be enabled via a solrconfig directive.  This will be faster when
    not all stored fields are needed from a document (klaas, SOLR-52)   
10. Made admin JSPs return XML and transform them with new XSL stylesheets
    (Otis Gospodnetic, SOLR-58)
11. If the "echoParams=explicit" request parameter is set, request parameters are copied 
    to the output. In an XML output, they appear in new <lst name="params"> list inside 
    the new <lst name="responseHeader"> element, which replaces the old <responseHeader>. 
    Adding a version=2.1 parameter to the request produces the old format, for backwards 
    compatibility (bdelacretaz and yonik, SOLR-59).

Optimizations 
 1. getDocListAndSet can now generate both a DocList and a DocSet from a 
    single lucene query.
 2. BitDocSet.intersectionSize(HashDocSet) no longer generates an intermediate
    set
 3. OpenBitSet completed, replaces BitSet as the implementation for BitDocSet.
    Iteration is faster, and BitDocSet.intersectionSize(BitDocSet) and unionSize
    is between 3 and 4 times faster. (yonik, SOLR-15)
 4. much faster unionSize when one of the sets is a HashDocSet: O(smaller_set_size)
 5. Optimized getDocSet() for term queries resulting in a 36% speedup of facet.field
    queries where DocSets aren't cached (for example, if the number of terms in the field
    is larger than the filter cache.) (yonik)
 6. Optimized facet.field faceting by as much as 500 times when the field has
    a single token per document (not multiValued & not tokenized) by using the
    Lucene FieldCache entry for that field to tally term counts.  The first request
    utilizing the FieldCache will take longer than subsequent ones.

Bug Fixes
 1. Fixed delete-by-id for field types who's indexed form is different
    from the printable form (mainly sortable numeric types).
 2. Added escaping of attribute values in the XML response (Erik Hatcher)
 3. Added empty extractTerms() to FunctionQuery to enable use in
    a MultiSearcher (Yonik)
 4. WordDelimiterFilter sometimes lost token positionIncrement information
 5. Fix reverse sorting for fields were sortMissingFirst=true
    (Rob Staveley, yonik)
 6. Worked around a Jetty bug that caused invalid XML responses for fields
    containing non ASCII chars.  (Bertrand Delacretaz via yonik, SOLR-32)
 7. WordDelimiterFilter can throw exceptions if configured with both
    generate and catenate off.  (Mike Klaas via yonik, SOLR-34)
 8. Escape '>' in XML output (because ]]> is illegal in CharData) 
 9. field boosts weren't being applied and doc boosts were being applied to fields (klaas)
10. Multiple-doc update generates well-formed xml (klaas, SOLR-65)
11. Better parsing of pingQuery from solrconfig.xml (hossman, SOLR-70)
12. Fixed bug with "Distribution" page introduced when Versions were
    added to "Info" page (hossman)
13. Fixed HTML escaping issues with user input to analysis.jsp and action.jsp
    (hossman, SOLR-74)

    (Alexander Saar via hossman, SOLR-78)

2006/01/17 Solr open sourced, moves to Apache Incubator
