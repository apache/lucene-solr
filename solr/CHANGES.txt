==================  9.0.0 ==================

Consult the lucene/CHANGES.txt file for additional, low level, changes in this release.
Docker and contrib modules have separate CHANGES.md files.

New Features
---------------------
* SOLR-14789: Migrate docker image creation from docker-solr repo to solr/docker. (Houston Putman, Martijn Koster, Tim Potter, David Smiley, janhoy, Mike Drob)

* SOLR-15019: Replica placement API needs a way to fetch existing replica metrics. (ab, ilan)

* SOLR-15055: Re-implement 'withCollection'. This also adds the placement plugin support
  for rejecting replica / collection deletions that would violate placement constraints. (ab, ilan)

Improvements
----------------------
* LUCENE-8984: MoreLikeThis MLT is biased for uncommon fields (Andy Hind via Anshum Gupta)

* SOLR-14223: PKI Auth can bootstrap from existing key files instead of creating new keys on startup (Mike Drob)

  the clustering contrib to the new Carrot2 4.x line, dropping several CVE-prone dependencies along the way.
  The parameters and configuration of the contrib extensions have changed. The documentation in Solr ref guide
  has been rewritten from scratch to be up to date. Clustering code has been rewritten from scratch to work
  properly regardless of the mode (standalone, distributed). The API has been stripped of ancient, unused, interfaces
  and simplified. (Dawid Weiss)

  This leads to more consistent behavior no matter how /var/solr is mounted.
  * init_var_solr.sh is now invoked by docker-entrypoint.sh; not in a bunch of other places.
  * as before, you can set NO_INIT_VAR_SOLR=1 to short-circuit this.
  * init_var_solr.sh no longer echo's anything.  For verbosity, set VERBOSE=yes.
  (David Smiley)

  which can be used to select multiple collections that match collection property/value pairs. This is useful to
  maintain a whitelist of collections for which actions are taken without needing to hard code the collection names
  themselves. The collection hints are pushed down to the policy engine so operations for non-matching collections
  are not computed at all. (ab, shalin)

  'solr.allowPaths' that allows you to add other allowed paths when needed.

* SOLR-13286: Metrics will no longer write a (sometimes large) log message every minute. This can be re-enabled
  via log4j2.xml if desired, or other HttpSolrCall log messages may be quieted on a per handler basis. (Gus Heck)

  Solr can speedup the query resolution by using the Block-Max WAND algorithm (see LUCENE-8135). When doing this, the
  value of matching documents in the response (numFound) will be an approximation.
  (Ishan Chattopadhyaya, Munendra S N, Tomás Fernández Löbbe, David Smiley)

==================  8.4.1 ==================

Consult the LUCENE_CHANGES.txt file for additional, low level, changes in this release.

Versions of Major Components
---------------------
Apache Tika 1.19.1
Carrot2 3.16.0
Velocity 2.0 and Velocity Tools 3.0
Apache ZooKeeper 3.5.5
Jetty 9.4.19.v20190610

Upgrade Notes
---------------------

* SOLR-14158: Package manager now stores keys in package store instead of ZK. If you're using package manager and have already
  added any repositories, then you would need to re-add all the keys from /keys/exe location, one-by-one, using:
  "bin/solr add-key <keyfile.der>"

Bug Fixes
----------------------

* SOLR-14106: Cleanup Jetty SslContextFactory usage (Ryan Rockenbaugh, Jan Hoydahl, Kevin Risden)

* SOLR-14109: Always log to stdout from server/scripts/cloud-scripts/zkcli.{bat|sh} (janhoy)

  (noble, Ishan Chattopadhyaya)

==================  8.4.0 ==================

Consult the LUCENE_CHANGES.txt file for additional, low level, changes in this release.

Versions of Major Components
---------------------
Apache Tika 1.19.1
Carrot2 3.16.0
Velocity 2.0 and Velocity Tools 3.0
Apache ZooKeeper 3.5.5
Jetty 9.4.19.v20190610

Upgrade Notes
---------------------

* SOLR-13823: org.apache.solr.search.grouping.distributed.command.QueryCommand.Builder has new method 'setMainQuery' which is used
  to set top-level query. build() would fail if called without setting mainQuery.

* SOLR-13817: Deprecate legacy SolrCache implementations. Users are encouraged to transition their
  configurations to use org.apache.solr.search.CaffeineCache instead. (ab)

* SOLR-13982: Some security-related http headers such as Content-Security-Policy are now set. If you have custom html served
  up by Solr's http server that contains inline javascript, it will no longer execute in modern browsers. You can fix your JS
  code to not run inline anymore, or edit etc/jetty.xml and weaken the CSP, or remove/alter the headers with a reverse proxy. (rmuir)

* SOLR-13806: QueryResponse.getExplainMap() type has changed from Map<String, String> to Map<String, Object>
  in order to accommodate structured explanations. This is a partially back-compatible change - compiled
  third-party components will work the same as before due to type erasure but source code changes may be
  required.

* SOLR-14025: VelocityResponseWriter has been hardened - only trusted configsets can render configset provided
  templates and rendering templates from request parameters has been removed.

* SOLR-13904: timeAllowed parameter is allowed to have 0 value (Houston Putman, Mikhail Khludnev)

* SOLR-13970: Using Collapse filter or expand component with grouping is explicitly disallowed as the combination
  would cause inconsistent behavior and NPEs.

* SOLR-13978: The default configset no longer has the following:
    - Library inclusions (<lib ../>) for extraction, solr-cell libs, clustering, velocity, LTR and language identifier
    - /browse, /tvrh and /update/extract handlers
    - TermVector component (if someone wants it, can be added using config APIs)
    - XSLT response writer
    - Velocity response writer
  If you want to use them in your collections, please add them to your configset manually or through the Config APIs.

* SOLR-14071: Untrusted configsets (ones that are uploaded via unsecured configset API) cannot use <lib> directive.
  Consider enabling authentication/authorization so that the uploaded configsets are trusted.
  Note: If you already have a collection using untrusted configset that uses <lib> directive, it will not load after
  upgrading to 8.4. You can re-upload your configset using "bin/solr zk -upconfig .." or place your libraries in the
  classpath and restart Solr.

* SOLR-14065: VelocityResponseWriter has been deprecated and may be removed in a future version.

* SOLR-14072: The "Blob Store" API and "runtimeLib" plugin mechanism that uses it is now considered deprecated. The
  replacement to it is the "Package Management" system, which includes a "File Store". These are experimental currently
  but will grow/stabalize/mature.

  for distributed group.query case. (Uwe Jäger, Munendra S N)

* SOLR-13207: In dismax and edismax "minimum should match" queries, the < operator not followed by a number will now return
  an HTTP 400 error rather than 500, and the error message will explain that < must be followed by a number. (Chris Hennick)

* SOLR-13762: Fix BinaryField support for non-binary wt's (Thomas Woeckinger via Jason Gerlowski)

Velocity 2.0 and Velocity Tools 3.0
Apache ZooKeeper 3.5.5
Jetty 9.4.19.v20190610

Upgrade Notes
----------------------

* Users who have written test cases that extend SolrTestCaseJ4 may see NullPointerExceptions if
  their tests directly reference both SolrTestCaseJ4.initCoreDataDir and SolrTestCaseJ4.deleteCore().
  This change in behavior is due to a bug fix in deleteCore() to ensure the dataDir is properly reset
  in tests that call initCore()/deleteCore() multiple times in a given test (class).  initCoreDataDir
  is now deprecated, and users are encouraged to use SolrTestCaseJ4.initAndGetDataDir() in it's place.

* SOLR-13180: Fix ClassCastException in Json Request API (Johannes Kloos, Jan Høydahl, Munendra S N)

* SOLR-13417: Handle stats aggregation on date and string fields in SolrJ's JSON facet response processing
  (Jason Gerlowski, Munendra S N)

* SOLR-13712: JMX MBeans are not exposed because of race condition between creating platform mbean server and
  registering mbeans. (shalin)

* SOLR-13802: Managed schema manipulations were not persisting the optional luceneMatchVersion that can be set
  on an Analyzer. (Thomas Wöckinger)

* SOLR-13539: Fix for class-cast issues during atomic-update 'removeregex' operations. This also incorporated some
  tests Tim wrote as a part of SOLR-9505. (Tim Owen via Jason Gerlowski)

* SOLR-13790: LRUStatsCache size explosion and ineffective caching. (ab)

* SOLR-13376: Multi-node race condition to create/remove nodeLost markers. (hoss, ab)

* SOLR-13760: Fix regression in support for Date math in TRA start date that was introduced by SOLR-13375

* SOLR-13829: RecursiveEvaluator casts Continuous numbers to Discrete Numbers, causing mismatch (Trey Grainger, Joel Bernstein)

* SOLR-13815: Live shard split (where updates actively continue during the split) can lose updates due to cluster
  state happening to change between checking if the current shard is active and later checking if there are any
  sub-shard leaders to forward the update to. (yonik)

* SOLR-13665: Added missing netty dependencies to solrJ and upgraded netty to v 4.1.29.Final (Jörn Franke, janhoy)

* SOLR-13793: HttpSolrCall now maintains internal request count (_forwardedCount) for remote queries and limits them to
  the number of replicas. This avoids making too many cascading calls to remote servers, which, if not restricted, can
  bring down nodes containing the said collection (Kesharee Nandan Vishwakarma, Ishan Chattopadhyaya)

* SOLR-13834: ZkController#getSolrCloudManager() created a new instance of ZkStateReader, thereby causing mismatch in the
  visibility of the cluster state and, as a result, undesired race conditions (Clay Goddard via Ishan Chattopadhyaya)

* SOLR-13835: HttpSolrCall produces incorrect extra AuditEvent on AuthorizationResponse.PROMPT (janhoy, hossman)

* SOLR-13843: The MOVEREPLICA API ignores replica type and always adds 'nrt' replicas (Amrit Sarkar via shalin)

* SOLR-13677: All Metrics Gauges should be unregistered by components that registered them. (noble, ab)

* SOLR-13855: DistributedZkUpdateProcessor should have been propagating URP.finish() lifecycle like it used to before
  8.1 (a regression).  Impacts integrity since Run URP's finish() propagates this to the updateLog to fsync.
  (David Smiley)

==================  8.2.0 ==================

Consult the LUCENE_CHANGES.txt file for additional, low level, changes in this release.

Versions of Major Components
---------------------
Apache Tika 1.19.1
Carrot2 3.16.0
Velocity 2.0 and Velocity Tools 3.0
Apache ZooKeeper 3.5.5
Jetty 9.4.19.v20190610

Upgrade Notes
----------------------

* SOLR-8346: Upgrade ZooKeeper to 3.5.5. ZooKeeper 3.5.5 introduces more security features. Include in your zoo.cfg
  file at minimum the following:
  4lw.commands.whitelist=mntr,conf,ruok
  You can use
  4lw.commands.whitelist=* to enable all ZooKeeper "4 letter commands".
  (Erick Erickson)

* SOLR-13515: org.apache.solr.util.SolrPluginUtils.IdentityRegenerator has been removed, please use
  the identical org.apache.solr.search.NoOpRegenerator instead. (David Smiley, Christine Poerschke)

* SOLR-13541: Upgrade Jetty to 9.4.19.v20190610. (Erick Erickson, Cao Manh Dat)

* SOLR-13420: Routed Aliases now use collection properties rather than core properties to identify collections that
  belong to the alias by default. This should be invisible and fully backwards compatible from within solr, and
  existing routed alias collections with core based properties will continue to work, but new collections created will
  not add a property to core.properties anymoore so any external code that inspected core.properties will not find the
  'routedAliasName' key in new cores belonging to routed aliases.

* SOLR-13419: Time Routed Aliases now have a '__TRA__' infix preceding the timestamp portion of the collection names.
  collections with the old format will not be altered and will continue to work, but any new TRA's or new collections
  for existing TRA's will use the new format. Solr will handle this invisibly, but any external code that attempted to
  predict collection names in TRA's will probably need adjustment.

  (Mark Miller, Anshum Gupta)

* SOLR-12249: Better error message when grouping on a tokenized (non SortableText) field in SolrCloud (Erick Erickson)

* SOLR-13521: Fix input parameter handling in SchemaRequest.DynamicField and SchemaRequest.FieldTypes (Schema API)
  (Tomás Fernández Löbbe)

* SOLR-13496: Fix distributed grouping related NullPointerException in JSONWriter.writeSolrDocument (Christine Poerschke)

* SOLR-12013: collections API CUSTERSTATUS command fails when configset missing (Erick Erickson)

* SOLR-13509: NPE on omitHeader=true is fixed by sending omitHeader=false to shard searches (Munendra S N, Mikhail Khludnev)

* SOLR-13333: unleashing terms.ttf from terms.list when distrib=false (Munendra S N via Mikhail Khludnev)

* SOLR-13490: Fix CollectionStateWatcher/CollectionStatePredicate based APIs in ZkStateReader and
  CloudSolrClient to be triggered on liveNode changes.  Also add Predicate<DocCollection> equivalents

Bug Fixes
----------------------

* SOLR-13510: Intermittent 401's for internode requests with basicauth enabled (Cao Manh Dat, Colvin Cowie)

* SOLR-13523: In 8.1, Atomic Updates were broken (NPE) when the schema declared the new _nest_path_ field even if you

==================  8.1.0 ==================

Consult the LUCENE_CHANGES.txt file for additional, low level, changes in this release.

Versions of Major Components
---------------------
Apache Tika 1.19.1

Velocity 2.0 and Velocity Tools 3.0
Apache ZooKeeper 3.4.14
Jetty 9.4.14.v20181114

Upgrade Notes
----------------------

* Solr's default behavior when dealing with 'maxBooleanClauses' has changed to reduce the risk of exponential
  query expansion when dealing with pathological query strings.  A default upper limit of 1024 clauses
  (The same default prior to Solr 7.0) is now enforced at the node level, and can be overridden in solr.xml.
  The identically named solrconfig.xml setting is still available for limiting the size of 'explicit' boolean
  query strings, but this per-collection limit is still ristricted by the upper-bound of the global limit
  in solr.xml.  See SOLR-13336 for more details.

* When requesting the status of an async request via REQUESTSTATUS collections API, the response will
  include the list of internal async requests (if any) in the "success" or "failed" keys (in addition
  to them being included outside those keys for backwards compatibility). See SOLR-12708 for more
  details

* SOLR-13335: Velocity and Velocity Tools were both upgraded as part of this release. Velocity upgraded from 1.7 to 2.0.
  Please see https://velocity.apache.org/engine/2.0/upgrading.html about upgrading. Velocity Tools upgraded from 2.0 to
  3.0. For more details, please see https://velocity.apache.org/tools/3.0/upgrading.html for details about the upgrade.

* SOLR-13407: Update requests sent to non-routed aliases that point to multiple collections are no longer accepted. Until
  now Solr followed an obscure convention of updating only the first collection from the list, which usually was not what
  the user intended. This change explicitly rejects such update requests.

* SolrGangliaReporter has been removed from Solr because support for Ganglia has been removed from Dropwizard Metrics 4
  due to a transitive dependency on LGPL.

* Custom TransientSolrCoreCache implementations no longer use the Observer/Observable pattern. To notify Solr that
  a core has been aged out of the cache, call CoreContainer.queueCoreToClose(SolrCore). See SOLR-13400 for details.

* SOLR-13394: The default GC has been changed from CMS to G1. To override this (in order to switch to CMS or any
  other GC), use GC_TUNE section of bin/solr.in.sh or bin/solr.in.cmd.

* SOLR-5970: Until now, the CREATE command of Collections API returned status 0 even in case of failure. Now, the status
  code will be non-zero in case of failures (e.g. 4xx, 5xx).

New Features
----------------------
* SOLR-13131: Category Routed Aliases are now available for data driven assignment of documents to collections based on
  values of a field. The Ref Guide now has a page dedicated to explaining the different types of aliases. (Gus Heck,
  Moshe Bla)

* SOLR-13171 : A true streaming parser for javabin payload/stream without creating any objects (noble)

* SOLR-13261: Make SortableTextField work with export/streaming. NOTE: requires that the field have
  useDocValuesAsStored=true (either explicit or as the default).

* SOLR-12121: JWT Token authentication plugin with OpenID Connect implicit flow login through Admin UI (janhoy)

* SOLR-12120: New AuditLoggerPlugin type allowing custom Audit logger plugins (janhoy)

* SOLR-10436: Add hashRollup Streaming Expression (Joel Bernstein)

* SOLR-13276: Adding Http2 equivalent classes of CloudSolrClient and HttpClusterStateProvider (Cao Manh Dat)

* SOLR-13287: Allow zplot to visualize probability distributions in Apache Zeppelin (Joel Bernstein)

* SOLR-13271: Read-only mode for SolrCloud collections (ab, shalin)

* SOLR-13292: Provide extended per-segment status of a collection. (ab)

* SOLR-11127: REINDEXCOLLECTION command for re-indexing of existing collections. This issue also adds
  a back-compat check of the .system collection to notify users of potential compatibility issues after
  upgrades or schema changes. (ab)

* SOLR-13374: Add fetchSize parameter to the jdbc Streaming Expression (Joel Bernstein)

* SOLR-12638: Partial/Atomic Updates for nested documents.  This enables atomic updates for nested documents, without
  the need to supply the whole nested hierarchy (which would be overwritten if absent).  This is done by fetching the
  whole document hierarchy, updating the specific doc in the path that is to be updated, removing the old document
  hierarchy and indexing the new one with the atomic update merged into it.  Also, [child] Doc Transformer now works
  with RealTimeGet.  (Moshe Bla, David Smiley)

* SOLR-13262: Add collection RENAME command and support using aliases in most collection admin commands. (ab)

* SOLR-13391: Add variance and standard deviation stream evaluators (Nazerke Seidan, Joel Bernstein)

* SOLR-13427: Support simulating the execution of autoscaling suggestions. (ab)

Bug Fixes

* SOLR-12708: Async collection actions should not hide internal failures (Mano Kovacs, Varun Thacker, Tomás Fernández Löbbe)

* SOLR-11883: 500 code on functional query syntax errors and parameter dereferencing errors
(Munendra S N via Mikhail Khludnev)

* SOLR-13234: Prometheus Metric Exporter not threadsafe. This changes the prometheus exporter to collect metrics
  from Solr on a fixed interval controlled by this tool and prevents concurrent collections. This change also improves
  performance slightly by using the cluster state instead of sending multiple HTTP requests to each node to lookup
  all the cores.
  (Danyal Prout via shalin)

* SOLR-9882: 500 error code on breaching timeAllowed by core and distributed (fsv) search,
  old and json facets (Mikhail Khludnev)

* SOLR-13285: Updates with enum fields and javabin cause ClassCastException (noble)

* SOLR-13295: Reproducible failure in TestDistributedGrouping (Erick Erickson)

  It's fixed by fallback to json (Munendra S N via Mikhail Khludnev)

* SOLR-13244: Admin UI Nodes view fails and is empty when a node is temporarily down (janhoy)

* SOLR-13253: IndexSchema.getResourceLoader was being used to load non-schema things, which can be a memory leak if
  "shareSchema" and other circumstances occur.  Furthermore it's reference to SolrConfig was removed. (David Smiley)

* SOLR-7414: CSVResponseWriter & XLSXResponseWriter return empty field when fl alias is combined with '*' selector
  (Michael Lawrence, Munendra S N, Ishan Chattopadhyaya)

* SOLR-13351: Workaround for VELOCITY-908 (Kevin Risden)

* SOLR-13349: High CPU usage in Solr due to Java 8 bug (Erick Erickson)

* SOLR-13355: 'all' permission ignored by RuleBasedAuthorizationPlugin in most cases (Jason Gerlowski, janhoy)

* SOLR-13331: Atomic Update 'remove' operations broken for certain field types in SolrJ (Thomas Wockinger via Jason Gerlowski)

* SOLR-13388: Fix FileExchangeRateProvider to be a public class, as it appears in schema.xml (Uwe Schindler)

* SOLR-12860: MetricsHistoryHandler now uses PKI Auth for metrics collection in background thread (janhoy, Lorenzo)

* SOLR-13339: Prevent recovery, fetching index being kicked off after SolrCores already closed (Cao Manh Dat)

* SOLR-13393: Fixed ZkClientClusterStateProvider to prevent risk of leaking ZkStateReader/threads when
  processing concurrent requests during shutdown.  This primarily affected tests, but may have also caused
  odd errors/delays when restart/shutting down solr nodes.  (hossman)

* SOLR-13336: add maxBooleanClauses (default to 1024) setting to solr.xml, reverting previous effective
  value of Integer.MAX_VALUE-1, to restrict risk of pathalogical query expansion.  (hossman)

* SOLR-13386: OverseerTaskQueue#remove should not throw an exception when no node exists after an exists
  check and the Overseer work loop should not allow free spinning the loop when it hits a KeeperException.
  (Mark Miller, Fernandez-Lobbe, Mike Drob)

* SOLR-12371: Editing authorization config via REST API now works in standalone mode (janhoy)

* SOLR-13408: Cannot start/stop DaemonStream repeatedly, other API improvements (Erick Erickson)

* SOLR-13281: Fixed NPE in DocExpirationUpdateProcessorFactory (Munendra S N, Tomás Fernández Löbbe)

  (Erick Ericsson, Adrien Grand, Munendra S N, Scott Stults, Ishan Chattopadhyaya)

* SOLR-5970: Return correct status upon collection creation failure (Abraham Elmahrek, Ishan Chattopadhyaya,
  Jason Gerlowski, Kesharee Nandan Vishwakarma)

Other Changes
----------------------

* SOLR-11763: Upgrade Guava to 25.1-jre (Markus Jelsma, Kevin Risden)

* SOLR-13222: Improve logging in StreamingSolrClients (Peter Cseh via Kevin Risden)

* SOLR-12055: Enable async logging by default. This change improves throughput for logging. This opens
  up a small window where log messages could possibly be lost. If this is unacceptable, switching back to synchronous
  logging can be done by changing the log4j2.xml file, no internal Solr code changed to make async logging the default.
  (Erick Erickson)

* SOLR-12753: Async logging ring buffer and OOM error. When very long messages are written (1M messages or so),

Velocity 1.7 and Velocity Tools 2.0
Apache ZooKeeper 3.4.13
Jetty 9.4.14.v20181114

Upgrade Notes
----------------------

* Due to the introduction of LIR redesign since Solr 7.3 (SOLR-11702) and the removing of old LIR implementation in Solr 8.
  Rolling updates are not possible unless all nodes must be on Solr 7.3 or higher. If not updates can be lost.

* Solr nodes can now listen and serve HTTP/2 requests. Most of internal requests (sent by UpdateShardHandler, HttpShardHandler)
  Http2SolrClient is used. Since by default, internal requests are sent by using HTTP/2,
  Solr 8.0 nodes can't talk to old nodes (7.x). However we can follow these steps to do rolling updates:
  - Do rolling updates as normally, but the Solr 8.0 nodes must start with -Dsolr.http1=true as startup parameter.
    By using this parameter internal requests are sent by using HTTP/1.1
  - When all nodes are upgraded to 8.0, restart them, this time -Dsolr.http1 parameter should be removed.

* ALPN is not supported in Java 8 or lower version therefore when a node started in Java 8 or a lower version with SSL enabled,
  it will send and can only be able to handle HTTP/1.1 requests. In case of using SSL Java 9 or latter versions are recommended.

* Custom AuthenticationPlugin must provide its own setup for Http2SolrClient through
  implementing HttpClientBuilderPlugin.setup, if not internal requests can't be authenticated.

* LUCENE-7996: The 'func' query parser now returns scores that are equal to 0
  when a negative value is produced. This change is due to the fact that
  Lucene now requires scores to be positive. (Adrien Grand)

* SOLR-11882: SolrMetric registries retained references to SolrCores when closed. A
  change of SolrMetricMAnager.registerGauge and SolrMetricProducer.initializeMetrics
  method signatures was required to fix it. Third party components that use this API
  need to be updated. (Eros Taborelli, Erick Erickson, ab)

* LUCENE-8267: Memory codecs have been removed from the codebase (MemoryPostings,
  MemoryDocValues). If you used postingsFormat="Memory" or docValuesFormat="Memory"
  then either remove it to use the default or experiment with one of the others. (Dawid Weiss)

* SOLR-12586: The date format patterns used by ParseDateFieldUpdateProcessorFactory (present in "schemaless mode")
  are now interpreted by Java 8's java.time.DateTimeFormatter instead of Joda Time.  The pattern language is very
  similar but not the same.  Typically, simply update the pattern by changing an uppercase 'Z' to lowercase 'z' and
  that's it.  For the current recommended set of patterns in schemaless mode, see "Schemaless Mode" in the ref guide,
  or simply examine the default configSet.  Also note that the set of patterns (formats) here have
  expanded from before to subsume those patterns previously handled by the "extract" contrib (Solr Cell / Tika).
  (David Smiley, Bar Rotstein)

* SOLR-12593: The "extraction" contrib (Solr Cell) no longer does any date parsing, and thus no longer has the
  "date.formats" configuration.  To ensure date strings are properly parsed, use ParseDateFieldUpdateProcessorFactory
  (an URP) commonly registered with the name "parse-date" in "schemaless mode".  (David Smiley, Bar Rotstein)

* SOLR-12643: Since Http2SolrClient does not support exposing connections related metrics. These metrics are no longer
  available 'QUERY.httpShardHandler.{availableConnections, leasedConnections, maxConnections, pendingConnections}',
  'UPDATE.updateShardHandler.{availableConnections, leasedConnections, maxConnections, pendingConnections}'

* SOLR-12605: UpdateShardHandler's updateOnlyClient is now a Http2SolrClient (previous HttpSolrClient). This new
  client does not support 'maxConnections','maxConnectionsPerHost' parameters.

* SOLR-12640: HttpShardHandlerFactory's defaultClient is now a Http2SolrClient (previous HttpSolrClient). This new
  client does not support 'maxConnections','maxConnectionsPerHost' parameters. LBHttpSolrClient.Req and LBHttpSolrClient.Rsp
  are marked as deprecated, uses LBSolrClient.Req and LBSolrClient.Rsp instead.

* SOLR-12754: The UnifiedHighlighter hl.weightMatches now defaults to true.  If there are unforseen highlight problems,
  this may be the culprit.

* If you explicitly use BM25SimilarityFactory in your schema, the absolute scoring will be lower due to SOLR-13025.
  But ordering of documents will not change in the normal case. Use LegacyBM25SimilarityFactory if you need to force
  the old 6.x/7.x scoring. Note that if you have not specified any similarity in schema or use the default
  SchemaSimilarityFactory, then LegacyBM25Similarity is automatically selected for 'luceneMatchVersion' < 8.0.0.
  See also explanation in Reference Guide chapter "Other Schema Elements".

* SOLR-12535: Solr no longer accepts index time boosts in JSON provided to Solr.  This used to be provided like so:
  {'id':'1', 'val_s':{'value':'foo', 'boost':2.0}}  but will now produce an error.  A object/map structure will now only
  be interpreted as a child document or an atomic update; nothing else.  A uniqueKey is currently required on all child
  documents to be interpreted as such, though this may change in the future.  (David Smiley)

* SOLR-12633: When JSON data is sent to Solr with nested child documents split using the "split" parameter, the child
  docs will now be associated to their parents by the field/label string used in the JSON instead of anonymously.  Most
  users probably won't notice the distinction since the label is lost any way unless special fields are in the schema.
  This choice used to be toggleable with an internal/expert "anonChildDocs" parameter flag which is now gone.
  (David Smiley)

* SOLR-11774: In 'langid' contrib, the LanguageIdentifierUpdateProcessor base class changed some method signatures.
  If you have a custom language identifier implementation you will need to adapt your code.

* SOLR-9515: Hadoop dependencies have been upgraded to Hadoop 3.2.0 from 2.7.2. (Mark Miller, Kevin Risden)

* SOLR-5211: Deleting (or updating) documents by their uniqueKey is now scoped to only consider root documents, not
  child/nested documents.  Thus a delete-by-id won't work on a child doc (no-op), and an attempt to update a child doc
  by providing a new doc with the same ID would add a new doc (probably erroneous).  Both these actions were and still
  are problematic.  In-place-updates are safe though.  If you want to delete certain child documents and if you know
  they don't themselves have nested children then you must do so with a delete-by-query technique.

* SOLR-13248: The default replica placement strategy used in Solr has been reverted to the 'legacy' policy used by Solr
  7.4 and previous versions. This is due to multiple bugs in the autoscaling based replica placement strategy that was
  made default in Solr 7.5 which causes multiple replicas of the same shard to be placed on the same node in addition
  to the maxShardsPerNode and createNodeSet parameters being ignored. Although the default has changed, autoscaling
  will continue to be used if a cluster policy or preference is specified or a collection level policy is in use.
  The default replica placement strategy can be changed to use autoscaling again by setting a cluster property:
  curl -X POST -H 'Content-type:application/json' --data-binary '
  {
    "set-obj-property": {
      "defaults" : {
        "cluster": {
          "useLegacyReplicaAssignment":false
        }
      }
    }
  }' http://$SOLR_HOST:$SOLR_PORT/api/cluster


New Features
----------------------

* SOLR-12591: Expand the set of recognized date format patterns of schemaless mode to subsume those handled by the
  "extract" contrib (Solr Cell / Tika).  This is primarily a change in configuration of the default configSet for more
  patterns, but also included enabling "lenient" parsing in ParseDateFieldUpdateProcessorFactory.  The default
  locale was changed from ROOT to en_US since well-known patterns assume this locale.
  (David Smiley, Bar Rotstein)

* SOLR-12879: MinHash query parser that builds queries providing a measure of Jaccard similarity (Andy Hind via Tommaso Teofili)

* SOLR-12593: The default configSet now includes an "ignored_*" dynamic field.  (David Smiley)

* SOLR-12799: Allow Authentication Plugins to intercept internode requests on a per-request basis.
  The BasicAuth plugin now supports a new parameter 'forwardCredentials', and when set to 'true',
  user's BasicAuth credentials will be used instead of PKI for client initiated internode requests. (janhoy, noble)

* SOLR-12791: Add Metrics reporting for AuthenticationPlugin (janhoy)

* SOLR-12730: Implement staggered SPLITSHARD requests in IndexSizeTrigger. (ab)

* SOLR-12639: Umbrella JIRA for adding support HTTP/2 (Cao Manh Dat)

* SOLR-12768, SOLR-13129: Improved nested document support, and enabled in the default schema with the presence of _nest_path_.
  When this field is present, certain things happen automatically.  An internal URP is automatically used to populate
  it.  The [child] (doc transformer) will return a hierarchy with relationships; no params needed.  The relationship
  path is indexed for use in queries (can be disabled if not needed).  Also, child documents needn't provide a uniqueKey
  value as Solr will supply one automatically by concatenating a path to that of the parent document's key.
  (David Smiley, Moshe Bla).

* SOLR-13134: Allow the knnRegress Stream Evaluator to more easily perform bivariate regression.
  (Joel Bernstein)

* SOLR-13104: Add natural and repeat Stream Evaluators (Joel Bernstein)

* SOLR-13147: Add movingMAD Stream Evaluator (Joel Bernstein)

* SOLR-13155: Add command-line option for testing autoscaling configurations. (ab)

* SOLR-13241: Add 'autoscaling' tool support to solr.cmd (Jason Gerlowski)

* SOLR-11126: New Node-level health check handler at /admin/info/healthcheck and /node/health paths that
  checks if the node is live, connected to zookeeper and not shutdown. (Anshum Gupta, Amrit Sarkar, shalin)

Bug Fixes
----------------------

* SOLR-13058: Fix block that was synchronizing on the wrong collection in OverseerTaskProcessor (Gus Heck)

* SOLR-11774: langid.map.individual now works together with langid.map.keepOrig. Also the detectLanguage() API
  is changed to accept a Reader allowing for more memory efficient implementations (janhoy)

* SOLR-13126: Query boosts were not being combined correctly for documents where not all boost queries
  matched (Alan Woodward, Mikhail Khludnev)

* SOLR-13248: Autoscaling based replica placement is broken out of the box. Solr 7.5 enabled autoscaling based replica
  placement by default but in the absence of default cluster policies, autoscaling can place more than 1 replica of the
  same shard on the same node. Also, the maxShardsPerNode and createNodeSet was not respected. Due to these reasons,
  this issue reverts the default replica placement policy to the 'legacy' assignment policy that was the default until
  Solr 7.4. (Gus Heck, Andrzej Bialecki, Bram Van Dam, shalin)

* SOLR-13255 : ClasscastException when URPs try to read a String field which returns a ByteArrayUTF8CHarSequence . This is a regression
  in release 7.7 (noble)

*SOLR-13299: Fix Windows startup script to disable HTTP/2 if TLS is enabled on Java 8. (Uwe Schindler)


Improvements
----------------------

* SOLR-5211: If _root_ is defined in the schema, it is now always populated automatically.  This allows documents with
 children to be updated with a document that does not have children, whereas before it would break block-join queries.
 If you don't use nested documents then _root_ can be removed from the schema.  (Dr Oleg Savrasov, Moshe Bla,
 David Smiley, Mikhail Khludnev)

* SOLR-6117: The response format has changed slightly for ReplicationHandler error-cases.  All errors now have a non-200
  'status' field, a 'message' field giving more details on the error, and an optional 'exception' field.  (Shalin Mangar,
  Jason Gerlowski)

* SOLR-12888: The NestedUpdateProcessor (which populates internal fields for nested child docs) is now auto-registered
  to run immediately prior to RunUpdateProcessor.  If the schema has no _nest_*_ fields then it's a no-op.
  RunUpdateProcessorFactory looks up a special/internal URP chain "_preRun_" which is implicitly defined but could be
  defined by an app for customization if desired.  (David Smiley)

Optimizations
----------------------

* SOLR-12725: ParseDateFieldUpdateProcessorFactory should reuse ParsePosition. (ab)

* SOLR-13025: Due to LUCENE-8563, the BM25Similarity formula no longer includes the (k1+1) factor in the numerator
  This gives a lower absolute score but doesn't affect ordering, as this is a constant factor which is the same
  for every document. Use LegacyBM25SimilarityFactory if you need the old 6.x/7.x scoring. See also upgrade notes (janhoy)

* SOLR-13130: during the ResponseBuilder.STAGE_GET_FIELDS directly copy string bytes and avoid creating String Objects (noble)

Other Changes
----------------------

* SOLR-12614: Make "Nodes" view the default in AdminUI "Cloud" tab (janhoy)

* SOLR-12586: Upgrade ParseDateFieldUpdateProcessorFactory (present in "schemaless mode") to use Java 8's
  java.time.DateTimeFormatter instead of Joda time (see upgrade notes).  "Lenient" is enabled.  Removed Joda Time dependency.
  (David Smiley, Bar Rotstein)

* SOLR-5163: edismax now throws an exception when qf refers to a nonexistent field (Charles Sanders, David Smiley)

* SOLR-12805: Store previous term (generation) of replica when start recovery process (Cao Manh Dat)

* SOLR-12652: Remove SolrMetricManager.overridableRegistryName method (Peter Somogyi via David Smiley)

* LUCENE-8513: SlowCompositeReaderWrapper now uses MultiTerms directly instead of MultiFields (David Smiley)

* SOLR-11812: Remove backward compatibility of old LIR implementation in 8.0 (Cao Manh Dat)

* SOLR-12620: Remove the Admin UI Cloud -> Graph (Radial) view (janhoy)

* SOLR-12775: LowerCaseTokenizer is deprecated, and should be replaced by LetterTokenizer and
  LowerCaseFilter (Alan Woodward)

* SOLR-13036: Fix retry logic in JettySolrRunner (Gus Heck)

* SOLR-12535: Solr no longer accepts index time boosts in JSON provided to Solr. (David Smiley)

* SOLR-13086: Improve the error message reported by DocumentObjectBinder when a setter is not found (Gus Heck)

* SOLR-12365: Renamed class Config to XmlConfigFile (David Smiley)

* SOLR-9515: Hadoop dependencies have been upgraded to Hadoop 3.2.0 from 2.7.2. (Mark Miller, Kevin Risden)

Velocity 1.7 and Velocity Tools 2.0
Apache ZooKeeper 3.4.14
Jetty 9.4.14.v20181114

Upgrade Notes
----------------------

* SOLR-13234: The Prometheus Metric Exporter now collects metrics from Solr at a fixed schedule that is controlled
  by the exporter itself. The default interval is 60s but it can be changed by specifying the --scrape-interval
  command line parameter to the tool. The collected metrics are cached and returned for any requests coming in before
  the next scheduled collection. This can impact the freshness of the metrics if prometheus is configured to query the
  tool more frequently.

* SOLR-12708: When requesting the status of an async request via REQUESTSTATUS collections API, the response will
  include the list of internal async requests (if any) in the "success" or "failed" keys (in addition
  to them being included outside those keys for backwards compatibility). See SOLR-12708 for more
  details

Bug fixes
----------------------

* SOLR-13234: Prometheus Metric Exporter not threadsafe. This changes the prometheus exporter to collect metrics
  from Solr on a fixed interval controlled by this tool and prevents concurrent collections. This change also improves
  performance slightly by using the cluster state instead of sending multiple HTTP requests to each node to lookup
  all the cores.
  (Danyal Prout via shalin)

* SOLR-12708: Async collection actions should not hide internal failures (Mano Kovacs, Varun Thacker, Tomás Fernández Löbbe)

* SOLR-11876: In-place update fails when resolving from Tlog if schema has a required field (Justin Deoliveira, janhoy,
  Ishan Chattopadhyaya)

* SOLR-13398: Move log line "Processing SSL Credential Provider chain..." from INFO to DEBUG (janhoy)

* SOLR-13386: OverseerTaskQueue#remove should not throw an exception when no node exists after an exists
  check and the Overseer work loop should not allow free spinning the loop when it hits a KeeperException.
  (Mark Miller, Fernandez-Lobbe, Mike Drob)

* SOLR-13366: Clarify 'Invalid stage name' warning logging in AutoScalingConfig (Christine Poerschke)

* SOLR-12770: The 'shards' parameter handling logic changes to use a new config element to determine what hosts can be
  requested. Please see Apache Solr Reference Guide chapter "Distributed Requests" for details, as well as SOLR-12770.

New Features

* SOLR-13080: The "terms" QParser's "automaton" method semi-required that the input terms/IDs be sorted.  This
  query parser now does this.  Unclear if this is a perf issue or actual bug.  (Daniel Lowe, David Smiley)

* SOLR-13082: A trigger that creates trigger events more frequently than the cool down period can starve other triggers.
  This is mitigated to some extent by randomly choosing the trigger to resume after cool down. It is recommended that
  scheduled triggers not be used for very frequent operations to avoid this problem.
  (ab, shalin)

* SOLR-12514: Rule-base Authorization plugin skips authorization if querying node does not have collection replica (noble)

* SOLR-11853: Solr installer fails on SuSE linux (Markus Mandalka via janhoy)

* SOLR-12237: Fix incorrect SOLR_SSL_KEYSTORE_TYPE variable in solr start script (janhoy, Joel Bernstein)

* SOLR-13053: NodeAddedTrigger and NodeLostTrigger do not reserve added/removed time populated by restoreState
  (Cao Manh Dat)

* SOLR-13137: NPE when /admin/zookeeper/status endpoint hit in standalone mode (janhoy)

* SOLR-13091: REBALANCELEADERS is broken (Erick Erickson)

* SOLR-11998: RebalanceLeaders API broken response format with wt=JSON (Erick Erickson)

* SOLR-9735: Fix v2 API for AutoscalingHistoryHandler. (ab)

* SOLR-13168: Fixed a bug in TestInjection that caused test only code to be invoked when TLOG replicas
  recieved commits if java assertions were enabled. (hossman)

Improvements
----------------------

* SOLR-12881: Remove unneeded import statements (Peter Somogyi via Erick Erickson)

* SOLR-12992: When using binary format, ExportWriter to directly copy BytesRef instead of
  creating new String (noble)

* SOLR-12898: Replace cluster state polling with ZkStateReader#waitFor. (Mark Miller)

* SOLR-12897: Introduce AlreadyClosedException to clean up silly close / shutdown logging. (Mark Miller)

* SOLR-12896: Introduce more checks for shutdown and closed to improve clean close and shutdown. (Mark Miller)

* SOLR-12804: Remove static modifier from Overseer queue access. (Mark Miller)

* SOLR-12833: Add configurable timeout to VersionBucket lock. (Jeffery Yuan, Mark Miller)

* SOLR-12885: BinaryResponseWriter (javabin format) should directly copy from BytesRef to output (noble)

* SOLR-12973: Admin UI "Nodes" view support for replica* replica names. (Daniel Collins, Christine Poerschke, janhoy)

* SOLR-13090: All shipped configurations still have `maxBooleanClauses` default to 1024.  But if the
  `solr.max.booleanClauses` sysprop is specified, that will override the 1024 default.  This enables users to
  update this property across the board more easily. (Jason Gerlowski)

* SOLR-12983: JavabinLoader should avoid creating String Objects and create UTF8CharSequence fields from byte[] (noble)

* SOLR-13016: Computing suggestions when policy have "#EQUAL" or "#ALL" rules take too long (noble)

* SOLR-13029: solr.hdfs.buffer.size can be configured for HdfsBackupRepository for better performance (Tim Owen via Mikhail Khludnev)

==================  7.6.0 ==================

Consult the LUCENE_CHANGES.txt file for additional, low level, changes in this release.

Versions of Major Components
---------------------
Apache Tika 1.19.1
Carrot2 3.16.0
Velocity 1.7 and Velocity Tools 2.0
Apache ZooKeeper 3.4.11
Jetty 9.4.11.v20180605

Upgrade Notes
----------------------

* SOLR-12767: The min_rf parameter is no longer needed, Solr will always return the achieved replication factor (rf)
  in the response header.

* SOLR-12827: The cluster wide defaults structure has changed from {collectionDefaults: {nrtReplicas : 2}} to
  {defaults : {collection : {nrtReplicas : 2}}}.  The old format continues to be supported and can be read from
  ZK as well as written using the V2 set-obj-property syntax but it is deprecated and will be removed in Solr 9.
  We recommend that users change their API calls to use the new format going forward.

* SOLR-12739: Autoscaling policy framework is now used as the default strategy to select the nodes on which
  new replicas or replicas of new collections are created. Previously, the maxShardsPerNode parameter was not allowed
  on collections when autoscaling policy was configured. Also if an autoscaling policy was configured then the default
  was to set an unlimited maxShardsPerNode automatically. Now the maxShardsPerNode parameter is always
  allowed during collection creation and maxShardsPerNode should be set correctly (if required) regardless of whether
  autoscaling policies are in effect or not. The default value of maxShardsPerNode continues to be 1 as before. It can
  be set to -1 during collection creation to fall back to the old behavior of unlimited maxShardsPerNode when using
  autoscaling policy.

* SOLR-12861: Added a Solr factory for ByteBuffersDirectory, which will replace deprecated RAMDirectory in Solr 9.0.

New Features
----------------------

* SOLR-6280: {!collapse}: if you attempt to use CollapseQParser on a field that is multi-valued, you will now get an
  error.  Previously, the collapsing behavior was unreliable and undefined despite no explicit error.
  (Munendra S N, David Smiley)

* SOLR-9317: ADDREPLICA command should be able to add more than one replica to a collection,shard at a time.
  The API now supports 'nrtReplicas', 'tlogReplicas', 'pullReplicas' parameters as well 'createNodeSet' parameter.
  As part of this change, the CREATESHARD API now delegates placing replicas entirely to the ADDREPLICA command
  and uses the new parameters to add all the replicas in one API call. (shalin)

* SOLR-11522: /autoscaling/suggestions now include rebalance options as well even if there are no violations (noble)

* SOLR-12822: /autoscaling/suggestions to include suggestion to add-replica for lost replicas (noble)

* SOLR-12815: Implement maxOps limit for IndexSizeTrigger. (ab)

* SOLR-12843: Implement a MultiContentWriter in SolrJ to post multiple files/payload at once (noble)

* SOLR-12780: Add support for Leaky ReLU and TanH activations in contrib/ltr NeuralNetworkModel class.
  (Kamuela Lau, Christine Poerschke)

* SOLR-12846: Added support for "host" variable in autoscaling policy rules (noble)

* SOLR-5004: Splitshard collections API now supports splitting into more than 2 sub-shards directly i.e. by providing a
  numSubShards parameter (Christine Poerschke, Anshum Gupta)

* SOLR-12754: The UnifiedHighlighter has a new hl.weightMatches param defaulting to false (will be true in 8.0).  It's
  the highest query accuracy mode, and furthermore phrase queries are highlighted as one.  (David Smiley)

* SOLR-12828: Add oscillate Stream Evaluator to support sine wave analysis. (Joel Bernstein)

* SOLR-11907: Add convexHull and associated geometric Stream Evaluators. (Joel Bernstein)

* SOLR-12811: Add enclosingDisk and associated geometric Stream Evaluators. (Joel Bernstein)

* SOLR-12840: Add pairSort Stream Evaluator (Joel Bernstein)

* SOLR-12862: Add log10 Stream Evaluator and allow the pow Stream Evaluator to accept a vector of exponents (Joel Bernstein)

* SOLR-12942: Add an option in IndexSizeTrigger to select the split shard method. (ab)

* SOLR-12938: Cluster Status returns results for aliases, instead of throwing exceptions (Gus Heck)

* SOLR-11997: Suggestions API/UI should show an entry where a violation could not be resolved (noble)

* SOLR-12971: Add pivot Stream Evaluator to pivot facet co-occurrence counts into a matrix (Joel Bernstein)

* SOLR-12795: Introduce 'rows' and 'offset' parameter in FacetStream (Joel Bernstein, Amrit Sarkar, Varun Thacker)

* SOLR-11572: Add recip Stream Evaluator to support reciprocal transformations (Joel Bernstein)

* SOLR-12936: Allow percentiles Stream Evaluator to accept an array of percentiles to calculate (Joel bernstein)

* SOLR-12829: Add plist (parallel list) Streaming Expression (Joel Bernstein)

* SOLR-12975: Add ltrim and rtrim Stream Evaluators (Joel Bernstein)

* SOLR-12962: Added a new 'uninvertible' option for fields and fieldtypes. This defaults to 'true' for
  backcompat allowing a FieldCache to be built for indexed fields as needed, but users are encouraged
  to set this to false (using docValues as needed) to reduce the risk of large fluxuations in heap
  size due to unexpected attempts to sort/facet/function on non-docValue fields. (hossman)


Other Changes
----------------------

* SOLR-12762: Fix javadoc for SolrCloudTestCase.clusterShape() method and add a method that validates only against
  Active slices (Anshum Gupta)

* SOLR-12756: Refactor Assign and extract replica placement strategies out of it. Now, assignment is done with the help
  of a builder class instead of calling a method with large number of arguments. The number of special cases that had
  to be handled have been cut down as well. (shalin)

* SOLR-12827: Migrate cluster wide defaults syntax in cluster properties to a nested structure. The structure has
  changed from {collectionDefaults: {nrtReplicas : 2}} to {defaults : {collection : {nrtReplicas : 2}}}.
  (ab, shalin)

* SOLR-12835: Document statistics exposed by the Query Result Cache when maxRamMB is configured. (shalin)

* SOLR-12423: Upgrade to Tika 1.19.1 when available (Tim Allison via Erick Erickson)

* SOLR-12793: Move TestCloudJSONFacetJoinDomain and TestCloudJSONFacetSKG to the facet test package (Varun Thacker)

* SOLR-12861: Add Solr factory for ByteBuffersDirectory.

* SOLR-12746: Simplify the Ref Guide HTML structure and use semantic HTML tags where possible. Adds new template files
  for Asciidoctor HTML conversion. Building the HTML version now requires the Slim gem. (Cassandra Targett)

* SOLR-12956: Add Javadoc @since tag to Analyzer component classes (Alexandre Rafalovitch)

* SOLR-12966: Add Javadoc @since tag to URP classes (Alexandre Rafalovitch)

* SOLR-12600: Fix parameter names in Solr JSON documentation (Alexandre Rafalovitch)

* SOLR-12497: Add documentation to use Hadoop credential provider-based keystore/trustsore.
(Mano Kovacs, Cassandra Targett)

* SOLR-13006: ZkNodeProps to be able to load from both javabin and JSON (noble)

Bug Fixes
----------------------

* SOLR-12803: Ensure ConcurrentUpdateSolrClient sends documents to correct collection (Jason Gerlowski)

* SOLR-11836: FacetStream works with bucketSizeLimit of -1 which will fetch all the buckets.
  (Alfonso Muñoz-Pomer Fuentes, Amrit Sarkar via Varun Thacker)

* SOLR-12776: Setting of TMP in solr.cmd causes invisibility of Solr to JDK tools (Petr Bodnar via Erick Erickson)

* SOLR-12648: Autoscaling framework based replica placement is not used unless a policy is specified or
  non-empty cluster policy exists. (shalin)

* SOLR-12750: Migrate API should lock the collection instead of shard. (shalin)

* SOLR-12767: When using min_rf, shard leader skipped bad replicas instead of marking them for recovery, this could
  create inconsistencies between replicas of the same shard. min_rf parameter is now deprecated, and even if provided
  replicas that don't ack an update from the leader will be marked for recovery. (Tomás Fernández Löbbe)

* SOLR-12814: Metrics history causing "HttpParser URI is too large >8192" when many collections (janhoy)

* SOLR-12836: ZkController creates a cloud solr client with no connection or read timeouts. Now the http client
  created by the update shard handler is used instead. (shalin)

* SOLR-12729: SplitShardCmd should lock the parent shard to prevent parallel splitting requests. (ab)

* SOLR-12851: Improvements and fixes to let and select Streaming Expressions (Joel Bernstein)

* SOLR-12874: Java 9+ GC Logging filesize parameter should use a unit.  (Tim Underwood via Uwe Schindler)

* SOLR-12868: Request forwarding for v2 API is broken (noble)

* SOLR-7557: Fix parsing of child documents using queryAndStreamResponse (Marvin Bredal Lillehaug/Stian Østerhaug via janhoy)

* SOLR-12875: fix ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException when unique(field) or uniqueBlock(_root_) is
used with DVHASH method in json.facet. (Tim Underwood via Mikhail Khludnev)

* SOLR-12243: Edismax missing phrase queries when phrases contain multiterm synonyms
  (Elizabeth Haubert, Alessandro Benedetti, Uwe Schindler, Steve Rowe)

* SOLR-12977: Autoscaling tries to fetch metrics from dead nodes (noble)

* SOLR-12978: In autoscaling NPE thrown for nodes where value is absent (noble)

Improvements
----------------------

* SOLR-12767: Solr now always includes in the response of update requests the achieved replication factor
   (Tomás Fernández Löbbe)

* SOLR-12782: UninvertingReader wrapping is now a bit more lightweight: Does not create FieldInfo for fields that
  can't be uninverted (saves mem) and can avoid wrapping the reader altogether if there's nothing to uninvert.
  IndexSchema.getUninversionMap refactored to getUninversionMapper and no longer merges FieldInfos. (David Smiley)

* SOLR-12739: Make autoscaling policy based replica placement the default strategy for placing replicas. (shalin)

* SOLR-12806: use autoscaling policies with strict=false to prioritize node allocation (noble)

* SOLR-10981: Support for stream.url or stream.file pointing to gzipped data.  It's detected by either a content
  encoding header or file extension. (Andrew Lundgren via David Smiley, Jan Høydahl)

* SOLR-12892: MapWriter to use CharSequence instead of String (noble)

* SOLR-12882: Eliminate excessive lambda allocation in json facets FacetFieldProcessorByHashDV (Tim Underwood)

* SOLR-12699: Make contrib/ltr LTRScoringModel immutable and cache its hashCode.
  (Stanislav Livotov, Edward Ribeiro, Christine Poerschke)

* LUCENE-8557: Some internal LeafReader.getFieldInfos implementations were being re-computed on-demand instead of
  once up front leading to some slowdowns in places like JSON Facets and field collapsing. (Tim Underwood, David Smiley)

* SOLR-12964: Json Facets: use DocValuesIterator advanceExact() instead of advance() in FacetFieldProcessorByHashDV and
  UniqueSinglevaluedSlotAcc. (Tim Underwood)

* SOLR-12880: Json Facets: Show the FacetProcessor class name instead of the FacetRequest in the JSON Facets debug-trace
  output (Tim Underwood)

==================  7.5.0 ==================

Consult the LUCENE_CHANGES.txt file for additional, low level, changes in this release.

Versions of Major Components
---------------------
Apache Tika 1.18
Carrot2 3.16.0
Velocity 1.7 and Velocity Tools 2.0
Apache ZooKeeper 3.4.11
Jetty 9.4.11.v20180605

Upgrade Notes
----------------------

* The data-driven schema no longer returns the *_str field-copy of text fields by default. The *_str field is still
  created and can be used for e.g. sorting, but to retrieve it you now need to explicitly list it in "fl" (SOLR-12350)

* LUCENE-7976: TieredMergePolicy now respects maxSegmentSizeMB by default when executing
  findForcedMerges (optimize) and findForcedDeletesMerges (expungeDeletes) (Erick Erickson)

* SOLR-12395: SignificantTermsQParserPlugin's name is now 'significantTerms' and its old name 'sigificantTerms' is deprecated.

* SOLR-11694: Extremely outdated UIMA contrib module has been removed (Alexandre Rafalovitch)

* SOLR-12008: The configuration file for log4j2.xml is now in ../server/resources/log4j2.xml. All other copies have been removed.
  WINDOWS USERS: This JIRA corrects a bug in the start scripts that put example logs under ...\server, solr.log is
  now under ...\example. (Erick Erickson)

* SOLR-12398: The heatmap facet response structure, when returned in JSON, changed from an even/odd name/value array to
  an object style.  Although the object style makes more sense, this was an overlooked back-compat break; sorry.



New Features
----------------------

* SOLR-11865: The QueryElevationComponent now has a useConfiguredElevatedOrder setting. When multiple docs are elevated,
  this specifies whether their relative order should be the order in the configuration file or if not then should they
  be subject to whatever the sort criteria is.  Additionally, QEC was extensively refactored to be more extensible.
  (Bruno Roustant, David Smiley)

* SOLR-12474: Add an UpdateRequest Object that implements RequestWriter.ContentWriter (noble)

* SOLR-12361: Allow nested child documents to be in field values of a SolrInputDocument as an alternative to
  add/get ChildDocuments off to the side.  The latter is now referred to as "anonymous" child documents as opposed to
  "labelled" (by the field name).  Anonymous child docs might be deprecated in the future.  This is an internal change
  that should work for javabin/SolrJ; separate issues will address XML & JSON formats populating nested docs in this way.
  AddUpdateCommand and it's relationship with DirectUpdateHandler2 was reworked substantially. (Moshe Bla, David Smiley)

* SOLR-12362: Uploading docs in JSON now supports child documents as field values, thus providing a label to the
  relationship instead of the current "anonymous" relationship.  Use of this experimental feature sometimes requires a
  anonChildDocs=false parameter until Solr 8 due to syntax ambiguities.  (Moshe Bla, David Smiley)

* SOLR-12485: Uploading docs in XML now supports child documents as field values, thus providing a label to the
  relationship instead of the current "anonymous" relationship. (Moshe Bla, David Smiley)

* SOLR-12441: (EXPERIMENTAL) New NestedUpdateProcessorFactory (URP) to populate special fields _nest_parent_ and
  _nest_path_ of nested (child) documents. It will generate a uniqueKey of nested docs if they were blank too.
  (Moshe Bla, David Smiley)

* SOLR-12519: The [child] transformer now returns a nested child doc structure (attached as fields if provided this way)
  provided the schema has the _nest_path_ field.  This is part of a broader enhancement of nested docs.
  (Moshe Bla, David Smiley)

* SOLR-12722: The [child] transformer now takes an 'fl' param to specify which fields to return.  It will evaluate
  doc transformers if present.  In 7.5 a missing 'fl' defaults to the current behavior of all fields, but in 8.0
  defaults to the top/request "fl". (Moshe Bla, David Smiley)

* SOLR-11578: Solr 7 Admin UI (Cloud > Graph) should reflect the Replica type to give a more accurate representation
  of the cluster. (Rhoit Singh via Erick Erickson)

* SOLR-12507: Modify collection API should support un-setting properties. (shalin)

* SOLR-12506: Add SolrJ support for the modify collection API. (shalin)

* SOLR-12398: The JSON Facet API now supports type=heatmap facets, just as classic faceting does. (David Smiley)

* SOLR-11985: Support percentage values in replica attribute in autoscaling policy (noble)

* SOLR-12511: Support non integer values for replica in autoscaling policy (noble)

* SOLR-12517: Support range values for replica in autoscaling policy (noble)

* SOLR-12530: Ability to disable configset upload via -Dconfigset.upload.enabled=false startup parameter
  (Ishan Chattopadhyaya)

* SOLR-12495: An #EQUAL function for replica in autoscaling policy to equally distribute replicas (noble)

* SOLR-11986: Allow percentage in freedisk attribute in autoscaling policy rules (noble)

* SOLR-12522: Support a runtime function `#ALL` for 'replica' in autoscaling policies (noble)

* SOLR-12567: JSON Facet "functions" now support an extended "type:func" syntax, similar to other types
  of facets.  This also allows additional local params to be specified for if the aggregation function
  can take advantage of them.  (hossman)

* SOLR-12581: the JSON Facet 'relatedness()' aggregate function now supports a 'min_popularity' option
  using the extended type:func syntax (hossman)

* SOLR-12536: autoscaling policy support to equally distribute replicas on the basis of arbitrary properties (noble)

* SOLR-8207: Add "Nodes" view to the Admin UI "Cloud" tab, listing nodes and key metrics (janhoy)

* SOLR-7767: "ZK Status" sub menu under "Cloud" tab to see status of zookeeper ensemble (janhoy)

* SOLR-11990: Make it possible to co-locate replicas of multiple collections together in a node. A collection may be
  co-located with another collection during collection creation time by specifying a 'withCollection' parameter. It can
  also be co-located afterwards by using the modify collection API. The co-location guarantee is enforced regardless of
  future cluster operations whether they are invoked manually via the Collection API or by the Autoscaling framework.
  (noble, shalin)

* SOLR-12402: Factor out SolrDefaultStreamFactory class. (Christine Poerschke)

* SOLR-12592: support #EQUAL function, range operator, decimal and percentage in cores in autoscaling policies (noble)

* SOLR-12655: Add Korean morphological analyzer ("nori") to default distribution. This also adds examples
  for configuration in Solr's schema.  (Uwe Schindler)

* SOLR-11863: Add knnRegress Stream Evaluator to support nearest neighbor regression (Joel Bernstein)

* SOLR-12702: Add zscores Stream Evaluator (Joel Bernstein)

* SOLR-12687: Add functions to cache data structures and mathematical models (Joel Bernstein)

* SOLR-12671: Add robust flag to knnRegress Stream Evaluator (Joel Bernstein)

* SOLR-12660: Add outliers Stream Evaluator to support outlier detection with probability distributions
  (Joel Bernstein)

* SOLR-12634: Add gaussfit Stream Evaluator (Joel Bernstein)

* SOLR-12629: The predict evaluator should work with the polyfit function (Joel Bernstein)

* SOLR-12715: NodeAddedTrigger should support adding replicas to new nodes by setting preferredOperation=addreplica.
  (shalin)

* SOLR-11861: When creating a configSet via the API, the "baseConfigSet" parameter now defaults to "_default".
  (Amrit Sarkar, David Smiley)

* SOLR-12716: NodeLostTrigger should support deleting replicas from lost nodes by setting preferredOperation=deletenode.
  (shalin)

* SOLR-9418: Added a new (experimental) PhrasesIdentificationComponent for identifying potential phrases
  in query input based on overlapping shingles in the index. (Akash Mehta, Trey Grainger, hossman)

* SOLR-11943: Add machine learning functions for location data (Joel Bernstein)

* SOLR-12612: Cluster properties restriction of known keys only is relaxed, and now unknown properties starting with "ext."
  will be allowed. This allows custom to plugins set their own cluster properties. (Jeffery Yuan via Tomás Fernández Löbbe)

* SOLR-12357: Time Routed Aliases now have a preemptiveCreateMath option to preemptively and asynchronously create the
  next collection in advance as new data gets within this time window of the end. (Gus Heck, David Smiley)

Bug Fixes
----------------------

* SOLR-12449: Response /autoscaling/diagnostics shows improper json (noble)

* SOLR-11676: Keep nrtReplicas and replicationFactor in sync while creating a collection and modifying a collection
  (Varun Thacker)

* SOLR-12489: User specified replicationFactor and maxShardsPerNode is used when specified during a restore operation.
  A user can now specify nrtReplicas/tlogReplicas/pullReplicas while restoring the collection.
  Specifying replicationFactor or nrtReplicas have the same effect and only one can be specified (Varun Thacker)

* SOLR-11216: Race condition in PeerSync (Cao Manh Dat)

* SOLR-11807: Restoring collection now treats maxShardsPerNode=-1 as unlimited (Varun Thacker)

* SOLR-12413: If Zookeeper was pre-loaded with data before first-use, then the aliases information would be ignored.
  (David Smiley, Gaël Jourdan, Gus Heck)

* SOLR-12482: Config API returns status 0 for failed operations. (Steve Rowe)

* SOLR-12513: Reproducing TestCodecSupport.testMixedCompressionMode failure (Erick Erickson)

* SOLR-11665: Improve error handling of shard splitting. Fix splitting of mixed replica types. (ab)

* SOLR-12326: JSON Facet API: terms facet shard requests now indicate if they have more buckets to prevent
  unnecessary refinement requests. (yonk)

* SOLR-12427: Improve error message for invalid 'start', 'rows' parameters. (Munendra S N via Jason Gerlowski)

* SOLR-12395: Make 'significantTerms' the SignificantTermsQParserPlugin's name and deprecate its old 'sigificantTerms' name.
  (Tobias Kässmann, Christine Poerschke)

* SOLR-12533 Collection collection fails if metrics are called during core creation (Peter Cseh, Mano Kovacs)

* SOLR-2834: Fix SolrJ Field and Document analyzes for types that include CharacterFilter (Alexandre Rafalovitch)

* SOLR-12516: Fix some bugs in 'type:range' Facet refinement when sub-facets are combined with non
  default values for the 'other' and 'include' options. (hossman)

* SOLR-12343: Fixed a bug in JSON Faceting that could cause incorrect counts/stats when using non default
  sort options.  This also adds a new configurable "overrefine" option. (Yonik Seeley, hossman)

* SOLR-12553: Allow SignificantTerms Query Parser to use local parameters (Alexandre Rafalovitch)

* SOLR-12570: OpenNLPExtractNamedEntitiesUpdateProcessor cannot support multi fields because pattern replacement
  doesn't work correctly. (Koji Sekiguchi)

* SOLR-12576: Update ref guide for additional information displayed in cloud view (Erick Erickson)

* SOLR-12597: Migrate API should fail requests that do not specify split.key parameter (shalin)

* SOLR-12477: An update would return a client error(400) if it hit a AlreadyClosedException.
  We now return the error as a server error(500) instead (Jeffery via Varun Thacker)

* SOLR-12606: Fix InfixSuggestersTest.testShutdownDuringBuild() failures. (Steve Rowe)

* SOLR-12607: Fixed two separate bugs in shard splits which can cause data loss. The first case is when using TLOG
  replicas only, the updates forwarded from parent shard leader to the sub-shard leader are written only in tlog and
  not the index. If this happens after the buffered updates have been replayed then the updates can never be executed
  even though they remain the transaction log. The second case is when synchronously forwarding updates to sub-shard
  leader fails and the underlying errors are not propagated to the client. (Cao Manh Dat, shalin)

* SOLR-12344: SolrSlf4jReporter doesn't set MDC context. (ab)

* SOLR-12594: MetricsHistoryHandler.getOverseerLeader fails when hostname contains hyphen. (ab)

* SOLR-12615: HashQParserPlugin will no longer throw an NPE if the hash key field is a string when there are documents
  with empty values. All documents with empty values ( string , numeric ) will be processed by worker=0
  This would fix the NPE when using the search stream with partitionKeys. (Varun Thacker)

* SOLR-11770: NPE in tvrh if no field is specified and document doesn't contain any fields with term vectors

* SOLR-12541: Metrics handler throws an error if there are transient cores. (ab)

* SOLR-12470: Search Rate Trigger multiple bug fixes, improvements and documentation updates. (ab)

* SOLR-12665: Autoscaling policy not being refreshed due to caching (noble)

* SOLR-12649: CloudSolrClient retries requests unnecessarily exception from server (noble, shalin)

* SOLR-12670: RecoveryStrategy logs wrong wait time when retrying recovery. (shalin)

Optimizations
----------------------

* SOLR-12455: Refactor JSON serialization code into SolrJ package (noble)

* SOLR-11654: Time Routed Alias will now route documents to the ideal shard of a collection, thus avoiding a hop.
  Usually documents were already routed well but not always.  (Gus Heck, David Smiley)

* SOLR-11598: The export handler does not limit users to 4 sort fields and is now unlimited. However the speed at
  which we can export is directly proportional to the number of sort fields specified. This change also allows streaming
  expressions to group by on more than 4 fields. (Aroop Ganguly, Amrit Sarkar, Varun Thacker)

* SOLR-12305: When a replica is applying updates, some kind of updates can skip buffering for faster recovery.
  (Cao Manh Dat)

* SOLR-12509: Improve SplitShardCmd performance and reliability. A new method of splitting has been

  significant speedups and reduced CPU / IO load on shard leader. (ab)

* SOLR-11881: Retry update requests sent by leaders to it's followers (Varun Thacker, Mark Miller, Tomás Fernández Löbbe)

* SOLR-12616: Optimize Export writer upto 4 sort fields to get better performance.

  in the fl (field list) parameter, we save on one doc-value lookup. This can bring performance improvements of 15%
  and upwards depending on how many fields are in common. (Amrit Sarkar, Varun Thacker)

* SOLR-10697: HttpShardHandler now uses a default of 100k as maxConnections (10k previously) and default
  maxConnectionsPerHost as 100k (20 previously). They are now consisent with the UpdateShardHandler defaults.
  (Varun Thacker)

* SOLR-12723: Reduce object creation in HashBasedRouter. (ab)

==================  7.4.0 ==================

Consult the LUCENE_CHANGES.txt file for additional, low level, changes in this release.

Versions of Major Components
---------------------
Apache Tika 1.17
Carrot2 3.16.0
Velocity 1.7 and Velocity Tools 2.0
Apache UIMA 2.3.1
Apache ZooKeeper 3.4.11
Jetty 9.4.10.v20180503

Upgrade Notes
----------------------

* SOLR-7887: Solr now uses Log4J 2.11 . The log4j configuration is now in log4j2.xml rather than log4j.properties files.
  This is a server side change only and clients using SolrJ won't need any changes. Clients can still use any logging
  implementation which is compatible with SLF4J. We now let log4j2 handle rotation of solr logs at startup, and bin/solr
  start scripts will no longer attempt this nor move existing console or GC logs into logs/archived either (SOLR-12144).

* SOLR-11673: Slave doesn't commit empty index when completely new index is detected on master during replication.
  To return the previous behavior pass false to skipCommitOnLeaderVersionZero in slave section of replication
  handler configuration, or pass it to the fetchindex command.

* SOLR-11453: Configuring slowQueryThresholdMillis now logs slow requests to a separate file - solr_slow_requests.log.
  Previously they would get logged in the solr.log file.

  requests will fail when the coordinating node can't communicate with ZooKeeper,
  by setting the "shards.tolerant" param to "requireZkConnected".  (Steve Rowe)

* SOLR-9685: #Tagging queries in JSON Query DSL, equivalent to LocalParams based query/filter
  tagging.  Multiple tags are comma separated.
  LocalParams Example     : {!tag=colorfilt}color:blue
  Equivalent JSON Example : { "#colorfilt" : "color:blue" }
  (Dmitry Tikhonov, Mikhail Khludnev, yonik)

* SOLR-11779, SOLR-12438: Basic long-term collection of aggregated metrics. Historical data is
  maintained as multi-resolution time series using round-robin databases in the '.system'
  collection. New /admin/metrics/history API allows retrieval of this data in numeric
  or graph formats. (ab)

* SOLR-12387: cluster-wide defaults for numShards, nrtReplicas, tlogReplicas, pullReplicas (noble)

* SOLR-11929: UpdateLog metrics are not initialized on core reload.  (ab, Steve Rowe)

* SOLR-11882: SolrMetric registries retained references to SolrCores when closed. A
  change of SolrMetricMAnager.registerGauge and SolrMetricProducer.initializeMetrics
  method signatures was required to fix it. Third party components may continue to use the old API
  but should be updated to avoid this bug (Eros Taborelli, Erick Erickson, ab)

* SOLR-12261: If you attempt to delete a collection immediately after deleting an alias it used to be a part of, you may
  get an error that's it's a member of that alias.  This check now ensures the alias state is sync()'ed with ZK first.
  (David Smiley)

  (Yuyang Xiao, Uwe Schindler)

Optimizations
----------------------

* SOLR-11920: IndexFetcher now fetches only those files (from master/leader) that are different. This
  differential fetching now speeds up recovery times when full index replication is needed, but only
  a few segments diverge. (Ishan Chattopadhyaya, Shaun Sabo, John Gallagher)

* SOLR-11731: LatLonPointSpatialField can now decode points from docValues when stored=false docValues=true,
  albeit with maximum precision of 1.37cm (Karthik Ramachandran, David Smiley)

  Expanded docs (expand component) could be told incorrectly that scores are needed.  (David Smiley)

* SOLR-12338: Replay buffering tlog in parallel. (Cao Manh Dat, David Smiley)

* SOLR-12366: A slow "live docs" implementation was being used instead of a bitset.  Affects classic faceting
  enum method, JSON Facets enum method, UnInvertedField faceting, GraphTermsQParser, JoinQParser.  (David Smiley)

* SOLR-12337: Remove the obsolete QueryWrapperFilter intermediate wrapper, which also removed some needless uses of

  Affects ExpandComponent, ChildDocTransformer, CurrencyFieldType, TermsQParser.  (David Smiley)

* SOLR-9922: Write buffering updates to another tlog. (Cao Manh Dat)

* SOLR-12233: QParserPlugin's built-in static registry now holds actual QParserPlugin instances instead of class

  Also being able to run all Lucene and Solr tests as a configuration (Karthik Ramachandran via
  Varun Thacker, Uwe Schindler)

Upgrade Notes
----------------------

* SOLR-11748: The throttling mechanism used to limit the rate of autoscaling events processed
  has been removed. This deprecates the 'actionThrottlePeriodSeconds' setting in the set-properties
  Autoscaling API which is now a no-op. Use the 'triggerCooldownPeriodSeconds' instead to pause event
  processing.

* SOLR-11798: The top-level <highlighting> syntax in solrconfig.xml is now formally
  deprecated in favour of <searchComponent> equivalent syntax. See also SOLR-1696.

* SOLR-11809: QueryComponent's rq parameter parsing no longer considers the defType parameter.

* SOLR-11747: The behaviour of the autoscaling system has been modified to pause all triggers from execution between
  the start of actions and end of cool down period. The triggers will be resumed after the cool down period expires.
  Previously, the cool down period was a fixed period started after actions for a trigger event complete and during
  this time, all triggers continued to run but any events were rejected to be tried later.

* SOLR-11624: Collections created without specifying a configset name use a copy of the _default configset since 7.0.
  Before 7.3, the copied over configset was named the same as the collection name, but 7.3 onwards it will be named
  with an additional ".AUTOCREATED" suffix.

* SOLR-11702: The old Leader-In-Recovery implementation (SOLR-5495) is now deprecated and replaced. Solr will support
  rolling upgrades from old 7.x versions of Solr to future 7.x releases until the last release of
  the 7.x major version. This means in order to upgrade to Solr 8 in the future, you must be on Solr 7.3 or higher.

* LUCENE-8161: If you are using the spatial JTS library with Solr, you must upgrade to 1.15.0.  This new version
  of JTS is now dual-licensed to include a BSD style license.

* SOLR-12051: A new mechanism is introduced in SOLR-11702 to maintain consistency in SolrCloud between leader and replicas.
  This mechanism lets Solr know whether a replica is in-sync with the leader or not, even when the leader is not live.
  If all the replicas who participate in the leader election are out-of-sync with previous leader, the election will
  pause until a timeout (named "leaderVoteWait") before allowing an out-of-sync replica to become leader. Note that the
  new leader still needs to contains more updates than any other active replicas in the same shard. Therefore by
  increasing leaderVoteWait will increase the consistency (over availability) of the system. The default value of
  leaderVoteWait is 180,000 ms (3 minutes) and it can be adjusted in the "solrcloud" section of the solr.xml

* SOLR-11957: The default Solr log file size and number of backups is raised to 32MB and 10 respectively

* SOLR-12067: The default value of `autoReplicaFailoverWaitAfterExpiration` has been increased to 120 seconds
  from the earlier default of 30 seconds. This affects how soon Solr adds new replicas to replace the replicas
  on nodes which have either crashed or shutdown.

New Features
----------------------

* SOLR-11285: Simulation framework for autoscaling. (ab)

* LUCENE-2899: In the Solr analysis-extras contrib, added support for the

Upgrade Notes
----------------------

* SOLR-11501: Starting a query string with local-params {!myparser ...} is used to switch the query parser to another,
  and is intended for use by Solr system developers, not end users doing searches.  To reduce negative side-effects of
  unintended hack-ability, we've limited the cases that local-params will be parsed to only contexts in which the
  default parser is "lucene" or "func".
  So if defType=edismax then q={!myparser ...} won't work.  In that example, put the desired query parser into defType.
  Another example is if deftype=edismax then hl.q={!myparser ...} won't work for the same reason.  In that example,
  either put the desired query parser into hl.qparser or set hl.qparser=lucene.  Most users won't run into these cases
  but some will and must change.
  If you must have full backwards compatibility, use luceneMatchVersion=7.1.0 or something earlier. (David Smiley)

* SOLR-11501: The edismax parser by default no longer allows subqueries that specify a Solr parser using either
  local-params, or the older _query_ magic field trick.  For example
  {!prefix f=myfield v=enterp}  or  _query_:"{!prefix f=myfield v=enterp}"   are not supported by default anymore.
  If you want to allow power-users to do this, set uf=* _query_ or some other value that includes _query_.
  If you must have full backwards compatibility, use luceneMatchVersion=7.1.0 or something earlier. (David Smiley)

Detailed Change List
----------------------

Upgrade Notes
----------------------

* 'autoAddReplicas' feature is ported to autoscaling framework. Existing users of this feature should not have
  to change anything. Note these changes:
  1. Behaviour: Changing the autoAddReplicas property from disabled to enabled using MODIFYCOLLECTION API
  no longer replaces down replicas for the collection immediately. Instead, replicas are only added
  if a node containing them went down while autoAddReplicas was enabled. The params
  autoReplicaFailoverBadNodeExpiration and autoReplicaFailoverWorkLoopDelay are no longer used.
  2. Deprecations: Enabling/disabling autoAddReplicas cluster wide with the API will be deprecated; use
  suspend/resume trigger APIs with name='.auto_add_replicas' instead.

* SOLR-11195: shard and cluster metric reporter configuration now requires a class attribute.
  If a reporter configures the group="shard" attribute then please also configure the
  class="org.apache.solr.metrics.reporters.solr.SolrShardReporter" attribute.
  If a reporter configures the group="cluster" attribute then please also configure the
  class="org.apache.solr.metrics.reporters.solr.SolrClusterReporter" attribute.

* SOLR-11254: the abstract DocTransformer class now has an abstract score-less transform method variant.

* SOLR-11283: all Stream Evaluators in solrj.io.eval have been refactored to have a simplier and more
  robust structure. This simplifies and condenses the code required to implement a new Evaluator and
  makes it much easier for evaluators to handle differing data types (primitives, objects, arrays,
  lists, and so forth). (Dennis Gove)

* SOLR-10962: in the ReplicationHandler the master.commitReserveDuration sub-element is deprecated. Instead
  please configure a direct commitReserveDuration element for use in all modes (master, slave, cloud).

* SOLR-11482: RunExecutableListener was removed for security reasons. If you want to listen to
  events caused by updates, commits, or optimize, write your own listener as native Java class
  as part of a Solr plugin.

* SOLR-11477: in the XML query parser (defType=xmlparser or {!xmlparser ... })
  the resolving of external entities is now disallowed by default.

* SOLR-11215: Make a metric accessible through a single param. (ab)

* SOLR-11244: Query DSL for Solr (Cao Manh Dat)

Upgrading from Solr 6.x
----------------------

* All Trie* numeric and date field types have been deprecated in favor of *Point field types.
  Point field types are better at range queries (speed, memory, disk), however simple field:value queries underperform
  relative to Trie. Either accept this, or continue to use Trie fields.
  This shortcoming may be addressed in a future release.

* The default response type is now JSON ("wt=json") instead of XML, and line indentation is now on by default
  ("indent=on"). If you expect the responses to your queries to be returned in the previous format (XML
  format, no indentation), you must now you must now explicitly pass in "wt=xml" and "indent=off" as query
  parameters, or configure them as defaults on your request handlers.  See SOLR-10494 for more details.

* the cluster property 'legacyCloud' is set to false from 7.0. This means 'zookeeper is the truth' by
  default. If an entry for a replica does not exist in the state.json, that replica cannot get
  registered. This may affect users who use that feature where they bring up replicas and they are
  automatically registered as a part of a shard. However, it is possible to fall back to the old behavior by
  setting the property legacyCloud=true , in the cluster properties using the following command

  ./server/scripts/cloud-scripts/zkcli.sh -zkhost 127.0.0.1:2181  -cmd clusterprop -name legacyCloud -val true

* HttpClientInterceptorPlugin is now HttpClientBuilderPlugin and must work with a
  SolrHttpClientBuilder rather than an HttpClientConfigurer.

* HttpClientUtil now allows configuring HttpClient instances via SolrHttpClientBuilder
  rather than an HttpClientConfigurer. Use of env variable SOLR_AUTHENTICATION_CLIENT_CONFIGURER
  no longer works, please use SOLR_AUTHENTICATION_CLIENT_BUILDER

* SolrClient implementations now use their own internal configuration for socket timeouts,
  connect timeouts, and allowing redirects rather than what is set as the default when
  building the HttpClient instance. Use the appropriate setters on the SolrClient instance.

* HttpSolrClient#setAllowCompression has been removed and compression must be enabled as
  a constructor param.

* HttpSolrClient#setDefaultMaxConnectionsPerHost and
  HttpSolrClient#setMaxTotalConnections have been removed. These now default very
  high and can only be changed via param when creating an HttpClient instance.

* Query time join with scoring {!join score=none} (even none) doesn't handle single value numeric fields.
  Users are advised to convert these fields into string and reindex.

* Deprecated collection and configset methods on MiniSolrCloudCluster have been
  removed

* Index-time boosts are not supported anymore. If any boosts are provided, they
  will be ignored by the indexing chain. As a replacement, index-time scoring
  factors should be indexed in a separate field and combined with the query
  score using a function query.

* Deprecated method getNumericType() has been removed from FieldType. Use getNumberType() instead

* MBean names and attributes now follow hierarchical names used in metrics. This is reflected also in
  /admin/mbeans and /admin/plugins output, and can be observed in the UI Plugins tab, because now all these
  APIs get their data from the metrics API. The old (mostly flat) JMX view has been removed.

* <jmx> element in solrconfig.xml is no longer supported. Equivalent functionality can be configured in
  solr.xml using <metrics><reporter ...> element and SolrJmxReporter implementation. Limited back-compatibility
  is offered by automatically adding a default instance of SolrJmxReporter if it's missing, AND when a local
  MBean server is found (which can be activated either via ENABLE_REMOTE_JMX_OPTS in solr.in.sh or via system
  properties, eg. -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote). This default instance exports all Solr metrics from all
  registries as hierarchical MBeans. This behavior can be also disabled by specifying a SolrJmxReporter
  configuration with a boolean init arg "enabled" set to "false". For a more fine-grained control users
  should explicitly specify at least one SolrJmxReporter configuration.

* The sow (split-on-whitespace) request param now defaults to false (true in previous versions).
  This affects the edismax and standard/"lucene" query parsers: if the sow param is not specified,
  query text will not be split on whitespace before analysis. See
  https://lucidworks.com/2017/04/18/multi-word-synonyms-solr-adds-query-time-support/ .

* Setting <solrQueryParser defaultOperator="..."/> in schema is no longer allowed and will cause an exception.
  Please use "q.op" parameter on the request instead. For more details, see SOLR-10584.

* Setting <defaultSearchField> in schema is no longer allowed and will cause an exception.
  Please use "df" parameter on the request instead. For more details, see SOLR-10585.

* The PostingsSolrHighlighter is deprecated. Furthermore, it now internally works via a re-configuration
  of the UnifiedSolrHighlighter.

* Deprecated LatLonType, GeoHashField, SpatialPointVectorFieldType, and SpatialTermQueryPrefixTreeFieldType.
  Instead, switch to LatLonPointSpatialField or SpatialRecursivePrefixTreeFieldType or RptWithGeometrySpatialField.

* The 'lucenePlusSort' QParser has been deprecated, and is no longer implicitly defined.  If you wish to continue using
  this QParser untill Solr 8, you must explicitly register it in your solrconfig.xml:
     '<queryParser name="lucenePlusSort" class="solr.OldLuceneQParserPlugin"/>'

* In solrconfig.xml the deprecated <mergePolicy> and <mergeFactor> and <maxMergeDocs> elements have
  been removed in favor of the <mergePolicyFactory> element introduced by SOLR-8621 in Solr 5.5.0.

* Custom SolrMetricReporter classes must implement a new, factored out doInit() method and the validate() method
  must pass for all reporters including reporters that are not enabled, please see SOLR-10671 for details.

* TemplateUpdateRequestProcessorFactory uses {} instead of ${} for template

* SOLR-9565: The name of TemplateUpdateRequestProcessorFactory' is changed to 'template' from 'Template' and the
  name of 'AtomicUpdateProcessorFactory' is changed to 'atomic' from 'Atomic'

* The default for eDismax parameter 'lowercaseOperators' now depends on the luceneMatchVersion setting in solrconfig.
  It remains 'true' for luceneMatchVersion < 7.0.0 and changes to 'false' from 7.0.0. See also SOLR-4646

* The unused 'valType' option has been removed from ExternalFileField, if you have this in your schema you
  can safely remove it. see SOLR-10929 for more details.

* Config sets basic_configs and data_driven_schema_configs have now been merged into _default. It has data driven nature
  enabled by default, and can be turned off (after creating a collection) with:
     curl http://host:8983/solr/mycollection/config -d '{"set-user-property": {"update.autoCreateFields":"false"}}'
  Please see SOLR-10574 for details.

* The data driven config (now _default) for auto-creating fields earlier defaulted to "string" for text input.
  Now the default is to use "text_general" and to add a copyField to the schema, copying to a "*_str" dynamic field,
  with a cutoff at 256 characters. This enables full text search as well as faceting. See SOLR-9526 for more.

* SOLR-10123: The Analytics Component has been upgraded to support distributed collections, expressions over multivalued
  fields, a new JSON request language, and more. DocValues are now required for any field used in the analytics expression
  whereas previously docValues was not required. Please see SOLR-10123 for details.

* solrconfig.xml: <requestDispatcher handleSelect="..."> now defaults to false when luceneMatchVersion >= 7.0,
  thus ignoring "qt". Regardless, "qt" is still used as a SolrJ special parameter that specifies the request handler
  (tail URL path) to use.  If you have request handlers without a leading '/', you can set handleSelect="true"
  or better yet consider migrating.

* StandardRequestHandler is deprecated. Simply use SearchHandler instead.

* The parameter names 'fromNode' for MOVEREPLICA and 'source', 'target' for REPLACENODE have been deprecated and
  replaced with 'sourceNode' and 'targetNode' instead. The old names will continue to work for back-compatibility
  but they will be removed in 8.0. See SOLR-11068 for more details.

* All deperated methods of ClusterState (except getZkClusterStateVersion())
  have been removed. Use DocCollection methods instead.

* SOLR-11023: EnumField has been deprecated in favor of new EnumFieldType.

* SOLR-11239: The use of maxShardsPerNode is not supported when a cluster policy is in effect or
  when a collection specific policy is specified during collection creation.

* V2 APIs are now available at /api, in addition to /v2 (which is now deprecated). Legacy APIs continue to remain
  available at /solr.

* Solr was tested and is compatible with the final release candidate of Java 9. All startup scripts
  detect Java 9 correctly and setup Garbage Collector logging. If the configuration file contains
  logging options that are no longer supported with Java 9, startup will fail.

* SOLR-10307: If starting Jetty without the Solr start script, you must now pass keystore and truststore
  passwords via the env variables SOLR_SSL_KEY_STORE_PASSWORD and SOLR_SSL_TRUST_STORE_PASSWORD rather
  than system properties.

* SOLR-10379: ManagedSynonymFilterFactory has been deprecated in favor of ManagedSynonymGraphFilterFactory.

* SOLR-10503: CurrencyField has been deprecated in favor of new CurrencyFieldType.

New Features
----------------------
* SOLR-9857, SOLR-9858: Collect aggregated metrics from nodes and shard leaders in overseer. (ab)

* SOLR-9835: Create another replication mode for SolrCloud

* SOLR-10356: Adds basic math Streaming Evaluators (Dennis Gove)

* SOLR-10393: Adds UUID Streaming Evaluator (Dennis Gove)

* SOLR-10046: Add UninvertDocValuesMergePolicyFactory class. (Keith Laban, Christine Poerschke)

* SOLR-10547: JSON Facet API: Implement support for single-valued string fields for min/max aggregations.
  (yonik)

* SOLR-10262: Add support for configurable metrics implementations. (ab)

* SOLR-10431: Make it possible to invoke v2 api calls using SolrJ (Cao Manh Dat, Noble Paul, shalin)

* SOLR-10233: Add support for different replica types, that can handle updates differently:
  - NRT: Writes updates to transaction log and indexes locally. Replicas of type “NRT” support NRT
         (soft commits) and RTG. Any NRT replica can become a leader. This was the only type supported
         in SolrCloud until now and it’s the default type.
  - TLOG: Writes to transaction log, but not to index, uses replication to copy segment files from the
          shard leader. Any TLOG replica can become leader (by first applying all local transaction log
          elements). If a replica is of type TLOG but is also the leader, it will behave as a NRT. This
          is exactly what was added in SOLR-9835 (non-realtime replicas), just the API and naming changes.
  - PULL: Doesn’t index or writes to transaction log, just replicates from the shard leader. PULL replicas
          can’t become shard leaders (i.e., if there are only PULL replicas in the collection at some point,
          updates will fail same as if there is no leaders, queries continue to work), so they don’t even
          participate in elections.
  (Tomás Fernández Löbbe)

* SOLR-10278: A new DSL to set cluster-wide preferences and policies on how to allocate replicas to nodes
  (noble, shalin)

* SOLR-10373: Implement read API for autoscaling configuration at /admin/autoscaling or
  /cluster/autoscaling paths. (shalin)

* SOLR-10677: Expose a diagnostics API to return nodes sorted by load in descending order and
  any policy violations. (shalin)

* SOLR-7452: Refinement for JSON Facet API: Adding refine:true to any terms facet will cause an
  additional distributed search phase (overlapped with field retrieval) that requests additional info
  for top facet buckets from shards that did not previously contribute to that bucket.
  This will correct counts (and other statistics) for those top buckets collected in the first
  phase. (yonik)

* SOLR-10433: CollectionAdmin requests in SolrJ to support V2 calls (noble)

* SOLR-9989: Add support for PointFields in FacetModule (JSON Facets) (Cao Manh Dat)

* SOLR-9526: Data driven schema now indexes text field "foo" as both "foo" (text_general) and as "foo_str" (string)
  to facilitate both search and faceting. AddSchemaFieldsUpdateProcessor now has the ability to add a "copyField" to
  the type mappings, with an optional maxChars limitation. You can also define one typeMappings as default.
  This also solves issues SOLR-8495, SOLR-6966, and SOLR-7058
  (janhoy, Steve Rowe, hossman, Alexandre Rafalovitch, Shawn Heisey, Cao Manh Dat)

* SOLR-10123: Upgraded the Analytics Component to version 2.0 which now supports distributed collections, expressions over
  multivalued fields, a new JSON request language, and more. DocValues are now required for any field used in the analytics
  expression  whereas previously docValues was not required. Please see SOLR-10123 for details. (Houston Putman)

  (Mark Miller, shalin)

* SOLR-9837: Fix 55% performance regression of FieldCache uninvert time of
  numeric fields.  (yonik)

* SOLR-10408: v2 API introspect should return useful message for non-existent command (Cao Manh Dat)

* SOLR-10411: v2 Collection API "modify" command specification's replicationFactor property is incorrectly typed as string,
  should be integer (Cao Manh Dat)

* SOLR-10405: v2 API introspect response contains multiple copies of the experimental format WARNING (Cao Manh Dat)

* SOLR-10223: Allow running examples as root on Linux with -force option (janhoy)

* SOLR-10830: Solr now correctly enforces that the '_root_' field has the same fieldType as the
  uniqueKey field.  With out this enforcement, child document updating was unreliable. (hossman)

* SOLR-10876: Regression in loading runtime UpdateRequestProcessors like TemplateUpdateProcessorFactory (noble)

* SOLR-10886: Using V2Request.process(solrClient) method throws NPE if the API returns an error (Cao Manh Dat)

* SOLR-10921: Work around the static Lucene BooleanQuery.maxClauseCount that causes Solr's maxBooleanClauses
  setting behavior to be "last core wins".  This patch sets  BooleanQuery.maxClauseCount to its maximum value,
  thus disabling the global check, and replaces it with specific checks where desired via
  QueryUtils.build().  (yonik)

* SOLR-8689: Fix bin/solr.cmd so it can run properly on Java 9 (Uwe Schindler, hossman)

* SOLR-10723 JSON Facet API: resize() implemented incorrectly for CountSlotAcc, HllAgg.NumericAcc
  resulting in exceptions when using a hashing faceting method and sorting by hll(numeric_field).
  (yonik)

* SOLR-10719: Creating a core.properties fails if the parent of core.properties is a symlinked dierctory
  (Erick Erickson)

* SOLR-10360: Solr HDFS snapshot export fails due to FileNotFoundException error when using MR1 instead of

  the same name) might throw a NullPointerException if the referenced field had no indexed data in some
  shards. The fix included an optimization to use Solr's cached AtomicReader instead of re-calculating.
  (David Smiley)

* SOLR-10715: /v2/ should not be an alias for /v2/collections (Cao Manh Dat)

  creation of a Lucene FieldType every time a field is indexed. (John Call, yonik)

* SOLR-9822: JSON Facet API: Recover performance lost due to the DocValues transition to
  an iterator API (LUCENE-7407).  This only fixes calculating counts for single-valued
  string fields from the FieldCache, resulting in up to 56% better throughput for those cases.
  (yonik)

* SOLR-10727: Avoid polluting the filter cache for certain types of faceting (typically ranges) when
  the base docset is empty. (David Smiley)

* SOLR-11070: Make docValues range queries behave the same as Trie/Point fields for Double/Float Infinity cases
  (Tomás Fernández Löbbe, Andrey Kudryavtsev)

* SOLR-10634: JSON Facet API: When a field/terms facet will retrieve all buckets (i.e. limit:-1)
  and there are no nested facets, aggregations are computed in the first collection phase
  so that the second phase which would normally involve calculating the domain for the bucket
  can be skipped entirely, leading to large performance improvements. (yonik)

* SOLR-10722: Speed up Solr's use of the UnifiedHighlighter be re-using FieldInfos. (David Smiley)

Other Changes
----------------------

  the metrics API, legacy JMX support has been replaced with SolrJmxReporter functionality. Several reporter
  improvements (support for multiple prefix filters, "enabled" flag, reuse of service clients). (ab)

* SOLR-10418: Expose safe system properties via metrics API as 'system.properties' in 'solr.jvm' group.
  Add support for selecting specific properties from any compound metric using 'property' parameter to
  /admin/metrics handler. (ab)

  longer use the PostingsHighlighter.  It should behave mostly the same. (David Smiley)

* SOLR-10710: Fix LTR failing tests. (Diego Ceccarelli via Tomás Fernández Löbbe)

* SOLR-10755: delete/refactor many solrj deprecations (hossman)

* SOLR-10752: replicationFactor (nrtReplicas) default is 0 if tlogReplicas is specified when creating a collection
  (Tomás Fernández Löbbe)

  (Christine Poerschke, Steve Rowe)

* SOLR-8668: In solrconfig.xml remove <mergePolicy> (and related <mergeFactor> and <maxMergeDocs>)
  support in favor of the <mergePolicyFactory> element introduced by SOLR-8621 in Solr 5.5.0.
  (Christine Poerschke, hossman)

* SOLR-10419: All collection APIs should use the new Policy framework for replica placement. (Noble Paul, shalin)

* SOLR-10800: Factor out HttpShardHandler.transformReplicasToShardUrls from HttpShardHandler.prepDistributed.
  (Domenico Fabio Marino, Christine Poerschke)

* SOLR-10779: JavaBinCodec should use close consistently rather than having marshal() and close() call finish()
 (which closes the underlying stream). (Erick Erickson)

* SOLR-9623: Disable remote streaming in example configs by default. Adjust Upload Limit defaults (janhoy, yonik)

* SOLR-4646: eDismax lowercaseOperators now defaults to "false" for luceneMatchVersion >= 7.0.0 (janhoy, David Smiley)

* SOLR-8256: Set legacyCloud=false as default (Cao Manh Dat)

* SOLR-10929: Removed unused 'valType' option from ExternalFileField (hossman)

* SOLR-10864: Simplified how Trie vs Points based numerics are randomized by SolrTestCaseJ4 by adding a static
  option to PointsField to ignore 'precisionStep' attribute.  This change also begins to attempt to randomize
  'docValues' on numeric field types unless tests explicity enable/disable them. (hossman, Steve Rowe)

* LUCENE-7883: Solr no longer uses the context class loader when resolving
  resources, they are only resolved against Solr's own or "core" class loader
  by default.  (Uwe Schindler)

  where Trie numerics were previously hardcoded. (hossman, Steve Rowe, Anshum Gupta)

* SOLR-6807: Changed requestDispatcher's handleSelect to default to false, thus ignoring "qt".
  Simplified configs to not refer to handleSelect or "qt".  Switch all tests that assumed true to assume false
  (added leading '/' in request handlers). Switch all tests referring to "standard" request handler to
  instead refer to "/select" with SearchHandler. Deprecated the old StandardRequestHandler. (David Smiley)

* SOLR-10456: Deprecate timeout related setters from SolrClients, and replace with Builder based implementation
  (Jason Gerlowski, Anshum Gupta)

* SOLR-11004: Consolidate SolrClient builder code in an abstract base class (Jason Gerlowski, Anshum Gupta)

* SOLR-10967: Cleanup the default configset. The changes involve some documentation corrections, removing the currency
  field from the examples and a few dynamic fields (Varun Thacker)

* SOLR-11016: Fix TestCloudJSONFacetJoinDomain test-only bug (hossman)

* SOLR-10226: JMX metric "avgTimePerRequest" (and the corresponding metric in the metrics API for
  each handler) used to be a simple non-decaying average based on total cumulative time and the
  number of requests. New Codahale Metrics implementation applies exponential decay to this value,
  which heavily biases the average towards the last 5 minutes. (ab)

* SOLR-8593: Parallel SQL now uses Apache Calcite as its SQL framework. As part of this change
  the default aggregation mode has been changed to facet rather than map_reduce. There has also been changes
  to the SQL aggregate response and some SQL syntax changes. Consult the documentation for full details.


New Features
----------------------

* SOLR-9836: Add ability to recover from leader when index corruption is detected on SolrCore creation.
  (Mike Drob via Mark Miller)

* SOLR-9926: Allow passing arbitrary java system properties to zkcli. (Hrishikesh Gadre via Mark Miller)

* SOLR-9885: Allow pre-startup Solr log management in Solr bin scripts to be disabled. (Mano Kovacs via Mark Miller)

* SOLR-9481: Authentication and Authorization plugins now work in standalone mode if security.json is placed in
  SOLR_HOME on every node. Editing config through API is supported but affects only that one node. (janhoy)

* SOLR-8029: Added new style APIs and a framework for creating new APIs and mapping old APIs to new
  (noble, Steve Rowe, Cassandra Targett, Timothy Potter)

* SOLR-9933: SolrCoreParser now supports configuration of custom SpanQueryBuilder classes.
  (Daniel Collins, Christine Poerschke)

* SOLR-7955: Auto create .system collection on first request if it does not exist (noble)

* SOLR-10087: StreamHandler now supports registering custom streaming expressions from the blob store (Kevin Risden)

* SOLR-9997: Enable configuring SolrHttpClientBuilder via java system property. (Hrishikesh Gadre via Mark Miller)

* SOLR-9912: Add facet.excludeTerms parameter support. (Jonny Marks, David Smiley, Christine Poerschke)

* SOLR-9916: Adds Stream Evaluators to support evaluating values from tuples. Supports boolean,
  numeric, and conditional evaluators. BooleanOperations have been removed in preference of
  BooleanEvaluators. (Dennis Gove)

* SOLR-9903: Stop interrupting the update executor on shutdown, it can cause graceful shutdowns to put replicas into Leader
  Initiated Recovery among other undesirable things. (Mark Miller)

* SOLR-8396: Add support for PointFields in Solr (Ishan Chattopadhyaya, Tomás Fernández Löbbe)

* SOLR-9987: Add support for MultiValued DocValues in PointFields using SortedNumericDocValues (Tomás Fernández Löbbe)

* SOLR-5944: In-place updates of Numeric DocValues. To leverage this, the _version_ field and the updated
  field must both be stored=false, indexed=false, docValues=true. (Ishan Chattopadhyaya, hossman, noble,
  shalin, yonik)

* SOLR-10158: Add support for "preload" option in MMapDirectoryFactory.
  (Amrit Sarkar via Uwe Schindler)

* SOLR-10153 & SOLR-10152: The Unified and Postings based highlighters: Add hl.bs.type=SEPARATOR along with new param
  hl.bs.separator to break passages by a provided single character. (Amrit Sarkar, David Smiley)

* SOLR-10156: Add significantTerms Streaming Expression (Joel Bernstein)

* SOLR-8593: Integrate Apache Calcite into the SQLHandler (Kevin Risden, Cao Manh Dat, Joel Bernstein)

* SOLR-10146: Added button to the Admin UI 'Collection' tab for deleting an inactive shard (Amrit Sarkar, janhoy)

* SOLR-9999: Instrument DirectUpdateHandler2. This registers existing statistics under metrics API and adds
  more metrics to track the rates of update and delete commands. (ab)

* SOLR-9986: Implement DatePointField (Cao Manh Dat, Tomás Fernández Löbbe)

* SOLR-8045: Deploy V2 API at /v2 instead of /solr/v2 (Cao Manh Dat, Noble Paul)

* SOLR-10039: New LatLonPointSpatialField replacement for LatLonType (and some uses of RPT).  Multi-value capable
  indexed geo lat-lon points, query by rect or circle.  Efficient distance sorting/boosting too. (David Smiley)

* SOLR-10250: CloudSolrClient can now return versions for documents added or deleted when "versions=true" is passed.
  However, if there is a leader election while this request is in transit, the versions may not be returned from that
  shard. (Boris Naguet, Ishan Chattopadhyaya)

* SOLR-9045: Make RecoveryStrategy settings configurable. (Christine Poerschke)

* SOLR-10224: Add disk total and disk free metrics. (ab)

* SOLR-10085: SQL result set fields should be ordered by the field list (Joel Bernstein)

* SOLR-10254: significantTerms Streaming Expression should work in non-SolrCloud mode (Joel Bernstein)

* SOLR-10286: string/text fields may now declare themselves as large="true" in the schema.  Large fields are always
  lazy loaded and will only take up space in the document cache if the actual value is < 512KB.  This option
  requires "stored" and must not be multiValued.  It's intended for fields that might have very large values so that
  they don't get cached in memory. (David Smiley)

* SOLR-9185: Solr's edismax and "Lucene"/standard query parsers will no longer split on whitespace before sending
  terms to analysis, if given the "sow=false" request param ("sow"=>"split on whitespace").  This enables multi-term
  source synonyms to match at query-time using SynonymGraphFilterFactory; other analysis components will also now
  work at query time, e.g. ShingleFilterFactory.  By default, and when the "sow=true" param is specified, these
  parsers' behavior remains the same: queries will be split on whitespace before sending individual terms to analysis.
  (Steve Rowe)

  removal listener was called more than once for some items and not at all for other items. (Ben Manes, yonik)

* SOLR-10114: Reordered delete-by-query causes inconsistenties between shards that have
  child documents (Mano Kovacs, Mihaly Toth, yonik)

* SOLR-10159: When DBQ is reordered with an in-place update, upon whose updated value the DBQ is based
  on, the DBQ fails due to excessive caching in DeleteByQueryWrapper (Ishan Chattopadhyaya)

* SOLR-10020: CoreAdminHandler silently swallows some errors. (Mike Drob via Erick Erickson)

* SOLR-9824: Some bulk update paths could be very slow due to CUSC polling. (David Smiley, Mark Miller)

* SOLR-10055: Linux installer now renames existing bin/solr.in.* as bin/solr.in.*.orig to make the installed config in
  /etc/defaults be the one found by default when launching solr manually. (janhoy)

* SOLR-10196: ElectionContext#runLeaderProcess can hit NPE on core close. (Mark Miller)

* SOLR-10225: Fix HDFS BlockCache evictions metric to not count explicit removal

* SOLR-10269: MetricsHandler JSON output incorrect. (ab)

* SOLR-10279: The autoAddReplica feature can result in SolrCores being assigned new shards when using
  legacyCloud=false and will also fail on a state check when taking over a core registration with a new
  core. (Mark Miller, Hrishikesh Gadre, Patrick Dvorack)

* SOLR-10184: Fix bin/solr so it can run properly on java9 (hossman, Uwe Schindler)

* SOLR-10283: Learning to Rank (LTR) SolrFeature to reject searches with missing efi (External Feature Information) used by fq.
  (Christine Poerschke)

* SOLR-10237: Poly-fields should work with subfields that have docValues=true (Tomás Fernández Löbbe, David Smiley)

  (Benjamin Deininger, Troy Mohl, Steve Rowe)

* SOLR-10319: SolrCore "instanceDir" metric not visible in JMX. (ab)

Optimizations
----------------------

* SOLR-9941: Clear the deletes lists at UpdateLog before replaying from log. This prevents redundantly pre-applying
  DBQs, during the log replay, to every update in the log as if the DBQs were out of order. (hossman, Ishan Chattopadhyaya)

* SOLR-9764: All filters that match all documents in the index now share the same memory (DocSet).

  to benefit from stored field optimizations in Lucene that can avoid reading it when it's not needed.  If the field is
  multi-valued, they all move together to the end to retain order. (David Smiley)

Other Changes
----------------------

  by a core reload/shutdown. (Steve Rowe)

* SOLR-9800: Factor out FacetComponent.newSimpleFacets method. (Jonny Marks via Christine Poerschke)

* SOLR-9914: SimpleFacets: refactor "contains" check into "SubstringBytesRefFilter" class.
  (Jonny Marks, David Smiley, Christine Poerschke)

* SOLR-10072: The test TestSelectiveWeightCreation appears to be unreliable. (Michael Nilsson via Mark Miller)

* SOLR-10011: Refactor PointField & TrieField to now have a common base class, NumericFieldType. The
  TrieField.TrieTypes and PointField.PointTypes are now consolidated to NumericFieldType.NumberType. This
  refactoring also fixes a bug whereby PointFields were not using DocValues for range queries for
  indexed=false, docValues=true fields. (Ishan Chattopadhyaya, Tomás Fernández Löbbe)

* SOLR-9890: factor out ShardResultTransformerUtils.[un]marshSortValue methods
  (Judith Silverman, Christine Poerschke)

  correct now if other drivers were installed before test execution (e.g., through IDE).
  (hossman, Uwe Schindler)

* SOLR-8876: change morphline test config files to work around 'importCommands' bug when using java9 (hossman)

Detailed Change List
----------------------

Upgrade Notes
----------------------

* SOLR-9166: Export handler returns zero for numeric fields that are not in the original doc. One
  consequence of this change is that you must be aware that some tuples will not have values if
  there were none in the original document.

* SOLR-8785: Metrics related classes in org.apache.solr.util.stats have been removed in favor of
  the dropwizard metrics library. Any custom plugins using these classes should be changed to use
  the equivalent classes from the metrics library.
  As part of this, the following changes were made to the output of Overseer Status API:
  * The "totalTime" metric has been removed because it is no longer supported
  * The metrics "75thPctlRequestTime", "95thPctlRequestTime", "99thPctlRequestTime"
    and "999thPctlRequestTime" in Overseer Status API have been renamed to "75thPcRequestTime", "95thPcRequestTime"
    and so on for consistency with stats output in other parts of Solr.
  * The metrics "avgRequestsPerMinute", "5minRateRequestsPerMinute" and "15minRateRequestsPerMinute" have been
    replaced by corresponding per-second rates viz. "avgRequestsPerSecond", "5minRateRequestsPerSecond"
    and "15minRateRequestsPerSecond" for consistency with stats output in other parts of Solr.

* SOLR-9708: You are encouraged to try out the UnifiedHighlighter by setting hl.method=unified and report feedback. It
  might become the default in 7.0. It's more efficient/faster than the other highlighters, especially compared to the
  original Highlighter. That said, some options aren't supported yet.
  It will get more features in time, especially with your input. See HighlightParams.java
  for a listing of highlight parameters annotated with which highlighters use them.
  hl.useFastVectorHighlighter is now considered deprecated in lieu of hl.method=fastVector.

* SOLR-9712: maxWarmingSearchers now defaults to 1, and more importantly commits will now block if this
  limit is exceeded instead of throwing an exception (a good thing). Consequently there is no longer a
  risk in overlapping commits.  Nonetheless users should continue to avoid excessive committing. Users are
  advised to remove any pre-existing maxWarmingSearchers entries from their solrconfig.xml files.

* SOLR-7466: complexphrase query parser now supports leading wildcards, beware of its' possible heaviness.
  Users are encouraged to use ReversedWildcardFilter in index time analysis.

New Features
----------------------
* SOLR-9918: Add SkipExistingDocumentsProcessor that skips duplicate inserts and ignores updates to missing docs
  (Tim Owen via koji)

* SOLR-9293: Solrj client support for hierarchical clusters and other topics
  marker. (Dawid Weiss)

* SOLR-9681: FacetModule / JSON Facet API added the ability to add filters directly to
  any facet command.  The filters are applied after any domain change operations.
  Example:  { type:terms, field:category, filter:"user:yonik" }
  (yonik)

* SOLR-9442, SOLR-9787: Adds Array of Name Type Value (json.nl=arrntv) style to JSONResponseWriter.
  (Jonny Marks, Christine Poerschke, hossman)

* SOLR-8542: Adds Solr Learning to Rank (LTR) plugin for reranking results with machine learning models.
  (Michael Nilsson, Diego Ceccarelli, Joshua Pantony, Jon Dorando, Naveen Santhapuri, Alessandro Benedetti, David Grohmann, Christine Poerschke)

* SOLR-9055: Make collection backup/restore extensible. (Hrishikesh Gadre, Varun Thacker, Mark Miller)

* SOLR-9682: JSON Facet API: added "param" query type to facet domain filter specification to obtain
  filters via query parameters. (yonik)

* SOLR-9038: Add a command-line tool to manage the snapshots functionality (Hrishikesh Gadre via yonik)

* SOLR-9633: Limit memory consumed by FastLRUCache with a new 'maxRamMB' config parameter.
  (yonik, Michael Sun, shalin)

* SOLR-9666: SolrJ LukeResponse support dynamic fields (Fengtan via Kevin Risden)

* SOLR-9077: Streaming expressions should support collection alias (Kevin Risden)

* SOLR-9324: Support Secure Impersonation / Proxy User for solr authentication
  (Gregory Chanan, Hrishikesh Gadre via yonik)

* SOLR-9721: javabin Tuple parser for streaming and other end points (noble)

* SOLR-9708: Added UnifiedSolrHighlighter, a highlighter adapter for Lucene's UnifiedHighlighter. The adapter is a
  derivative of the PostingsSolrHighlighter, supporting mostly the same parameters with some differences.
  Introduced "hl.method" parameter which can be set to original|fastVector|postings|unified to pick the highlighter at
  runtime without the need to modify solrconfig from the default configuration. hl.useFastVectorHighlighter is now
  considered deprecated in lieu of hl.method=fastVector. (Timothy Rodriguez, David Smiley)

* SOLR-9728: Ability to specify Key Store type in solr.in.sh file for SSL (Michael Suzuki, Kevin Risden)

* SOLR-5043: New solr.dns.prevent.reverse.lookup system property that can be used to prevent long core
  (re)load delays on systems with missconfigured hostname/DNS (hossman)

* SOLR-9844: FieldCache information fetched via the mbeans handler or seen via the UI now displays the total size used.
  The individual cache entries in the response are now formatted better as well. (Varun Thacker)

* SOLR-9513: Generic authentication plugins (GenericHadoopAuthPlugin and ConfigurableInternodeAuthHadoopPlugin) that delegate
  all functionality to Hadoop authentication framework. (Hrishikesh Gadre via Ishan Chattopadhyaya)

* SOLR-9860: Enable configuring invariantParams via HttpSolrClient.Builder (Hrishikesh Gadre, Ishan Chattopadhyaya)

* SOLR-4735, SOLR-9921: Improve metrics reporting. This uses the dropwizard metric library, adding an internal
  API for registering and reporting metrics from Solr components. Several new metrics and an improved JMX
  reporter have been added (Alan Woodward, Jeff Wartes, Christine Poerschke, Kelvin Wong, shalin, ab)

* SOLR-9788: Use instrumented jetty classes provided by the dropwizard metric library. (shalin)

* SOLR-9805: Use metrics-jvm library to instrument jvm internals such as GC, memory usage and others. (shalin)

* SOLR-9812, SOLR-9911, SOLR-9960: Added a new /admin/metrics API to return all metrics collected by Solr via API.
  API supports four optional multi-valued parameters:
  - 'group' (all,jvm,jetty,node,core),
  - 'type' (all,counter,timer,gauge,histogram),
  - 'prefix' that filters the returned metrics,
  - 'registry' that selects one or more registries by prefix (eg. solr.jvm,solr.core.collection1)
  - Example: http://localhost:8983/solr/admin/metrics?group=jvm,jetty&type=counter
  - Example: http://localhost:8983/solr/admin/metrics?group=jvm&prefix=buffers,os
  - Example: http://localhost:8983/solr/admin/metrics?registry=solr.node,solr.core&prefix=ADMIN
  (shalin, ab)

* SOLR-9884: Add version to segments handler output (Steven Bower via Erick Erickson)

* SOLR-9725: Substitute properties into JdbcDataSource configuration ( Jamie Jackson, Yuri Sashevsky via Mikhail Khludnev)

* SOLR-9877: SOLR-9923: SOLR-9948: Use instrumented http client and connection pool in HttpShardHandler and
  UpdateShardHandler. The metrics are collected per query-less URL and method by default but it can be configured
  to host/method and per-method as well. (shalin)

* SOLR-9880: Add Ganglia, Graphite and SLF4J metrics reporters. (ab)

* SOLR-9897: Add hl.requireFieldMatch toggle support when using the UnifiedHighlighter.  Defaults to false like the
  other highlighters that support this. (David Smiley)

* SOLR-9905: Add NullStream to isolate the performance of the ExportWriter (Joel Bernstein)

* SOLR-9891: Add mkroot command to bin/solr and bin/solr.cmd (Erick Erickson)

* SOLR-9668,SOLR-7197: introduce cursorMark='true' in SolrEntityProcessor (Yegor Kozlov, Raveendra Yerraguntl via Mikhail Khludnev)

* SOLR-9684: Add priority Streaming Expression (Joel Bernstein, David Smiley)

* SOLR-9896: Instrument and collect metrics from query, update, core admin and core load thread pools. (shalin)

* SOLR-9854: Collect metrics for index merges and index store IO (ab)

* SOLR-8530: Add HavingStream to Streaming API and StreamingExpressions (Joel Bernstein)

* SOLR-7466: Enable leading wildcard in complexphrase query parser, optimize it with  ReversedWildcardFilterFactory
  when it's provided (Mikhail Khludnev)

* SOLR-9935: Add hl.fragsize support when using the UnifiedHighlighter to avoid snippets/Passages that are too small.
  Defaults to 70. (David Smiley)

* SOLR-9856: Collect metrics for shard replication and tlog replay on replicas (ab).

* SOLR-9886: Add a 'enable' flag to caches to enable/disable them (Pushkar Raste, noble)

* SOLR-9947: Clean up some SolrInfoMBean categories. Add an alternative hierarchical view in JMX
  for SolrInfoMBeans, which uses similar conventions to SolrJmxReporter. (ab)

Optimizations
----------------------
* SOLR-9704: Facet Module / JSON Facet API: Optimize blockChildren facets that have
  filters specified by using those filters as acceptDocs. (yonik)

* SOLR-9726: Reduce number of lookupOrd calls made by the DocValuesFacets.getCounts method.
  (Jonny Marks via Christine Poerschke)

* SOLR-9772: Deriving distributed sort values (fieldSortValues) should reuse
  comparator and only invalidate leafComparator. (John Call via yonik)

* SOLR-9786: FieldType has a new getSetQuery() method that can take a set of terms
  and create a more efficient query (such as TermsQuery).  The solr query parser has been
  changed to use this method when appropriate.  The parser also knows when it is being
  used to parse a filter and will create TermsQueries from large lists of normal terms
  or numbers, resulting in a query that will execute faster.  This also acts to avoid
  BooleanQuery maximum clause limit.  Query parsing itself has also been optimized,
  resulting in less produced garbage and 5-7% better performance.
  (yonik)

* SOLR-9902: StandardDirectoryFactory should use Files API for it's move implementation. (Mark Miller, Mike Drob)

Bug Fixes
----------------------
* SOLR-9701: NPE in export handler when "fl" parameter is omitted.
  (Erick Erickson)

* SOLR-9433: SolrCore clean-up logic uses incorrect path to delete dataDir on failure to create a core.
  (Evan Sayer, shalin)

* SOLR-9360: Solr script not properly checking SOLR_PID
  (Alessandro Benedetti via Erick Erickson)

* SOLR-9931: JSON Facet API hll (hyper-log-log) function returned 0 for non-empty buckets with no field values
  in local mode, but nothing for distributed mode.  Both modes now return 0.  (yonik)

* SOLR-9503: NPE in Replica Placement Rules when using Overseer Role with other rules (Tim Owen via noble)

* SOLR-9883: Example schemaless solr config files can lead to invalid tlog replays: when updates are buffered,
  update processors ordered before DistributedUpdateProcessor, e.g. field normalization, are never run. (Steve Rowe)

* SOLR-9644: SimpleMLTQParser and CloudMLTQParser did not handle field boosts properly
  and CloudMLTQParser included extra strings from the field definitions in the query.

Apache Tika 1.13
Carrot2 3.12.0
Velocity 1.7 and Velocity Tools 2.0
Apache UIMA 2.3.1
Apache ZooKeeper 3.4.6
Jetty 9.3.8.v20160314

Detailed Change List
----------------------

Upgrade Notes
----------------------

* If you use the JSON Facet API (json.facet) with method=stream, you must now set sort='index asc' to get the streaming
  behavior; otherwise it won't stream.  Reminder: "method" is a hint that doesn't change defaults of other parameters.

* If you use the JSON Facet API (json.facet) to facet on a numeric field and if you use mincount=0 or if you set the
  prefix, then you will now get an error as these options are incompatible with numeric faceting.

* Solr's logging verbosity at the INFO level has been greatly reduced, and
  you may need to update the log configs to use the DEBUG level to see all the
  logging messages you used to see at INFO level before.

* We are no longer backing up solr.log and solr_gc.log files in date-stamped copies forever. If you relied on
  the solr_log_<date> or solr_gc_log_<date> being in the logs folder that will no longer be the case.
  See SOLR-9570 for details.

* The create/deleteCollection methods on MiniSolrCloudCluster have been
  deprecated.  Clients should instead use the CollectionAdminRequest API.  In
  addition, MiniSolrCloudCluster#uploadConfigDir(File, String) has been
  deprecated in favour of #uploadConfigSet(Path, String)

* The bin/solr.in.sh (bin/solr.in.cmd on Windows) is now completely commented by default. Previously, this wasn't so,
  which had the effect of masking existing environment variables.

New Features
----------------------
* SOLR-5725: facet.method=enum can bypass exact counts calculation with facet.exists=true, it just returns 1 for

Optimizations
----------------------

* SOLR-9374: Speed up Jmx MBean retrieval for FieldCache. (Tim Owen via shalin)

* SOLR-9570: Various log tidying now happens at Solr startup:
  Old solr_log_<date> and solr_gc_log_<date> files are removed, avoiding disks to fill up,

==================  6.2.1 ==================

Bug Fixes
----------------------

* SOLR-9494: Use of {!collapse} sometimes doesn't correctly return true for Collector.needsScores(), especially when the
  query was cached. This can cause an exception when 'q' is a SpanQuery or potentially others. (David Smiley)

* SOLR-6744: fl renaming / alias of uniqueKey field generates null pointer exception in SolrCloud configuration
  (Mike Drob via Tomás Fernández Löbbe)

* SOLR-9445: Admin requests are retried by CloudSolrClient and LBHttpSolrClient on failure. (shalin)

* SOLR-9439: Shard split clean up logic for older failed splits is faulty. The delete shard API
  has also been made more resilient against failures resulting from non-existent cores. (shalin)

* SOLR-9430: Fix locale lookup in DIH <propertyWriter/> to use BCP47 language tags
  to be consistent with other places in Solr. Language names still work for backwards
  compatibility. (Uwe Schindler, Boris Steiner)

* SOLR-9389: HDFS Transaction logs stay open for writes which leaks Xceivers. (Tim Owen via Mark Miller)

* SOLR-9188: blockUnknown property makes inter-node communication impossible (noble)

  without replicating the index. This can cause data loss. (shalin)

* SOLR-9490: Fixed bugs in BoolField that caused it to erroneously return "false" for all docs depending
  on usage (Colvin Cowie, Dan Fox, hossman)

* SOLR-9438: Shard split can be marked successful and sub-shard states switched to 'active' even when
  one or more sub-shards replicas do not recover due to the leader crashing or restarting between the time
  the replicas are created and before they can recover. This can cause data loss. (shalin)

* SOLR-9408: Fix TreeMergeOutputFormat to add timestamp metadata to a commit. SolrCloud replication relies on this.
  (Jessica Cheng Mallet via Varun Thacker)

Detailed Change List
----------------------

New Features
----------------------

* SOLR-8782: Add asynchronous sugar methods to the SolrJ Collections API.  You
  can now call .processAsync() to run a method asynchronously, or
  .processAndWait() to wait for a call to finish without holding HTTP
  collections open.  (Alan Woodward)

* SOLR-8765: Enforce required parameters at query construction time in the SolrJ
  Collections API, add static factory methods, and deprecate old setter methods.
  (Alan Woodward, Jason Gerlowski)

* SOLR-8842: authorization APIs do not use name as an identifier for a permission
  for update, delete commands and 'before' attribute (noble)

* SOLR-8814: Support GeoJSON response writer and general spatial formatting.  Adding
     &wt=geojson&geojson.field=<your geometry field>
  Will return a FeatureCollection for each SolrDocumentList and a Feature with the

  to either extend AbstractSpatialFieldType or store a GeoJSON string.  This also adds
  a [geo] DocumentTransformer that can return the Shape in a variety of formats:
    &fl=[geo f=<your geometry field> w=(GeoJSON|WKT|POLY)]
  The default format is GeoJSON.  For information on the supported formats, see:
  https://github.com/locationtech/spatial4j/blob/master/FORMATS.md
  To return the FeatureCollection as the root element, add '&omitHeader=true" (ryan)

* The deprecated zkCredientialsProvider element in solrcloud section of solr.xml
  is now removed. Use the correct spelling (zkCredentialsProvider) instead.

* SOLR-7957: internal/expert - ResultContext was significantly changed and expanded
  to allow for multiple full query results (DocLists) per Solr request.
  TransformContext was rendered redundant and was removed. (yonik)

* Several changes have been made regarding the "Similarity" used in Solr, in order to provide
  better default behavior for new users.  There are 3 key impacts of these changes on existing
  users who upgrade:
  * DefaultSimilarityFactory has been removed. If you currently have DefaultSimilarityFactory explicitly
    referenced in your schema.xml, edit your config to use the functionally identical
    ClassicSimilarityFactory.  See SOLR-8239 for more details.
  * The implicit default Similarity used when no <similarity/> is configured in schema.xml has
    been changed to SchemaSimilarityFactory.  Users who wish to preserve back-compatible behavior should
    either explicitly configure ClassicSimilarityFactory, or ensure that the luceneMatchVersion
    for the collection is less then 6.0.  See SOLR-8270 + SOLR-8271 for details.
  * SchemaSimilarityFactory has been modified to use BM25Similarity as the default for fieldTypes that
    do not explicitly declare a Similarity.  The legacy behavior of using ClassicSimilarity as the
    default will occur if the luceneMatchVersion for the collection is less then 6.0, or the
    'defaultSimFromFieldType' configuration option may be used to specify any default of your choosing.
    See SOLR-8261 + SOLR-8329 for more details.

* If your solrconfig.xml file doesn't explicitly mention the schemaFactory to use then Solr will choose
  the ManagedIndexSchemaFactory by default. Previously it would have chosen ClassicIndexSchemaFactory.
  This means that the Schema APIs ( /<collection>/schema ) are enabled and the schema is mutable.
  When Solr starts your schema.xml file will be renamed to managed-schema. If you want to retain the old behaviour
  then please ensure that the solrconfig.xml explicitly uses the ClassicIndexSchemaFactory :
  <schemaFactory class="ClassicIndexSchemaFactory"/> or your luceneMatchVersion in the solrconfig.xml is less than 6.0

* SolrIndexSearcher.QueryCommand and QueryResult were moved to their own classes. If you reference them
  in your code, you should import them under o.a.s.search (or use your IDE's "Organize Imports").

* SOLR-8698: 'useParams' attribute specified in request handler cannot be overridden from request params

* When requesting stats in date fields, "sum" is now a double value instead of a date. See SOLR-8671

* SOLR-8736: The deprecated GET methods for schema are now accessible through the bulk API. The output
  has less details and is not backward compatible.

* In the past, Solr guaranteed that retrieval of multi-valued fields would preserve the order of values.
  Because values may now be retrieved from column-stored fields (docValues="true"), in conjunction with the
  fact that docValues do not currently preserve order, means that users should set useDocValuesAsStored="false"
  to prevent future optizations from using the column-stored values over the row-stored values when
  fields have both stored="true" and docValues="true".

* Formatted date-times from Solr have some differences. If the year is more than 4 digits, there is a leading '+'.
  When there is a non-zero number of milliseconds, it is padded with zeros to 3 digits. Negative year (BC) dates are
  now possible.  Parsing: It is now an error to supply a portion of the date out of its, range, like 67 seconds.

* SolrJ no longer includes DateUtil. If for some reason you need to format or parse dates, simply use Instant.format()
  and Instant.parse().

* If you are using an RPT or other spatial field referencing Spatial4j in its configuration, then replace the string
  "com.spatial4j.core" with "org.locationtech.spatial4j".  Consider updating direct to Solr 6.2 which accepts the
  old value, albeit with a warning.

Optimizations
----------------------
* SOLR-7876: Speed up queries and operations that use many terms when timeAllowed has not been
  specified.  Speedups of up to 8% were observed.  (yonik)

* SOLR-8037: Speed up creation of filters from term range queries (i.e. non-numeric range queries)
  and use the filter cache for term range queries that are part of larger queries.  Some observed
  speedups were up to 2.5x for production of filters, and up to 10x for query evaluation with
  embedded term range queres that resulted in filter cache hits.  (yonik)

* SOLR-8559: FCS facet performance optimization which significantly speeds up processing when terms
  are high cardinality and the matching docset is small. When facet minCount > 0 and the number of
  matching documents is small (or 0) this enhancement prevents considering terms which have a 0
  count. Also includes change to move to the next non-zero term value when selecting a segment
  position. (Keith Laban, Steve Bower, Dennis Gove)

* SOLR-8532: Optimize GraphQuery when maxDepth is set by not collecting edges at the maxDepth level.

  <maxMergeDocs|mergeFactor> may not be combined with <mergePolicyFactory> and
  <maxMergeDocs|mergeFactor> on their own or combined with <mergePolicy> is a warning.
  (Christine Poerschke, Shai Erera)

  Jetzke, Shawn Heisey, Alan Woodward)

* SOLR-8793: Fix Core admin status API to not fail when computing the size of the segments_N
  file if the file no longer exists (for example, if a commit happened and the IndexReader
  hasn't refreshed yet). In this case the reported size of the file is -1.
  (Shai Erera, Alexey Serba, Richard Coggins)

* SOLR-8728: ReplicaAssigner throws NPE when a partial list of nodes are only participating in replica
  placement. splitshard should preassign nodes using rules, if rules are present (noble, Shai Erera)

  (Ishan Chattopadhyaya, Steve Rowe)

* SOLR-8870: AngularJS Query tab no longer URL-encodes the /select part of the request, fixing possible 404 issue
  when Solr is behind a proxy. Also, now supports old-style &qt param when handler not prefixed with "/" (janhoy)

* SOLR-8725: Allow hyphen in collection, core, shard, and alias name as the non-first character
  (Anshum Gupta) (from 6.0)

* SOLR-8155: JSON Facet API - field faceting on a multi-valued string field without

Other Changes
----------------------

* SOLR-8758: Add a new SolrCloudTestCase class, using MiniSolrCloudCluster (Alan
  Woodward)

======================= 5.5.0 =======================

Consult the LUCENE_CHANGES.txt file for additional, low level, changes in this release

Versions of Major Components
---------------------
Apache Tika 1.7
Carrot2 3.10.4
Velocity 1.7 and Velocity Tools 2.0
Apache UIMA 2.3.1
Apache ZooKeeper 3.4.6
Jetty 9.2.13.v20150730

Upgrading from Solr 5.4
-----------------------

* The Solr schema version has been increased to 1.6. Since schema version 1.6, all non-stored docValues fields
  will be returned along with other stored fields when all fields (or pattern matching globs) are specified
  to be returned (e.g. fl=*) for search queries. This behavior can be turned on and off by setting
  'useDocValuesAsStored' parameter for a field or a field type to true (default since schema version 1.6)
  or false (default till schema version 1.5).
  Note that enabling this property has performance implications because DocValues are column-oriented and may
  therefore incur additional cost to retrieve for each returned document. All example schema are upgraded to
  version 1.6 but any older schemas will default to useDocValuesAsStored=false and continue to work as in
  older versions of Solr. If this new behavior is desirable, then you should set version attribute in your
  schema file to '1.6'. Re-indexing is not necessary to upgrade the schema version.
  Also note that while returning non-stored fields from docValues (default in schema versions 1.6+, unless
  useDocValuesAsStored is false), the values of a multi-valued field are returned in sorted order.
  If you require the multi-valued fields to be returned in the original insertion order, then make your
  multi-valued field as stored. This requires re-indexing.
  See SOLR-8220 for more details.

* All protected methods from CoreAdminHandler other than handleCustomAction() is removed by SOLR-8476 and can
  no more be overridden. If you still wish to override those methods, override the handleRequestBody()

* The PERSIST CoreAdmin action which was a NOOP and returned a deprecated message has been removed. See SOLR-8476
  for more details. The corresponding SolrJ action has also been removed.

* bin/post now defaults application/json files to the /update/json/docs end-point.  Use `-format solr` to force
  files to the /update end-point.   See SOLR-7042 for more details.

* In solrconfig.xml the <mergePolicy> element is deprecated in favor of a similar <mergePolicyFactory> element,
  the <mergeFactor> and <maxMergeDocs> elements are also deprecated, please see SOLR-8621 for full details.

  To migrate your existing solrconfig.xml, you can replace elements as follows:

  <!-- TieredMergePolicy example -->
  <!-- deprecated -->
  <mergeFactor>??</mergeFactor>
  <mergePolicy class="org.apache.lucene.index.TieredMergePolicy">
    <bool name="useCompoundFile">???</bool> <!-- deprecated since Lucene/Solr 4.4.0 -->
    ...
  </mergePolicy>
  <!-- replacement -->
  <useCompoundFile>???</useCompoundFile> <!-- since Lucene/Solr 4.4.0 -->
  <mergePolicyFactory class="org.apache.solr.index.TieredMergePolicyFactory">
    <int name="maxMergeAtOnce">??</int> <!-- formerly the <mergeFactor> element implicitly set this -->
    <int name="segmentsPerTier">??</int> <!-- formerly the <mergeFactor> element implicitly set this -->
    ...
  </mergePolicyFactory>

  <!-- Log(ByteSize|Doc)MergePolicy example -->
  <!-- deprecated -->
  <maxMergeDocs>????</maxMergeDocs>
  <mergeFactor>??</mergeFactor>
  <mergePolicy class="org.apache.lucene.index.Log?MergePolicy">
    <bool name="useCompoundFile">???</bool> <!-- deprecated since Lucene/Solr 4.4.0 -->
    ...
  </mergePolicy>
  <!-- replacement -->
  <useCompoundFile>???</useCompoundFile> <!-- since Lucene/Solr 4.4.0 -->
  <mergePolicyFactory class="org.apache.solr.index.Log?MergePolicyFactory">
    <int name="maxMergeDocs">????</int> <!-- formerly the <maxMergeDocs> element set this -->
    <int name="mergeFactor">??</int> <!-- formerly the <mergeFactor> element set this -->
    ...
  </mergePolicyFactory>

* Clearing up stored async collection api responses via REQUESTSTATUS call is now deprecated and would be
  removed in 6.0. See SOLR-8648 for more details.

* SOLR-6594: Deprecated the old schema API which will be removed in a later major release

Detailed Change List
----------------------

New Features
----------------------

* SOLR-7928: Improve CheckIndex to work against HdfsDirectory
  (Mike Drob, Gregory Chanan)

* SOLR-8378: Add upconfig and downconfig commands to the bin/solr script
  (Erick Erickson)

* SOLR-8434: Add wildcard support to role, to match any role in RuleBasedAuthorizationPlugin (noble)

* SOLR-4280: Allow specifying "spellcheck.maxResultsForSuggest" as a percentage of filter
  query results (Markus Jelsma via James Dyer)

* SOLR-8429: Add a flag 'blockUnknown' to BasicAuthPlugin to block unauthenticated requests (noble)

* SOLR-8230: JSON Facet API: add "facet-info" into debug section of response when debugQuery=true
  (Michael Sun, yonik)

* SOLR-8428: RuleBasedAuthorizationPlugin adds an 'all' permission (noble)

* SOLR-5743: BlockJoinFacetComponent and BlockJoinDocSetFacetComponent for calculating facets by
  child.facet.field parameter with {!parent ..}.. query. They count facets on children documents
  aggregating (deduplicating) counts by parent documents (Dr. Oleg Savrasov via Mikhail Khludnev)

* SOLR-8220: Read field from DocValues for non stored fields.
  (Keith Laban, yonik, Erick Erickson, Ishan Chattopadhyaya, shalin)

* SOLR-8470: Make TTL of PKIAuthenticationPlugin's tokens configurable through a system property
  (pkiauth.ttl) (noble)

* SOLR-8477: Let users choose compression mode in SchemaCodecFactory (Tomás Fernández Löbbe)

* SOLR-839: XML QueryParser support (defType=xmlparser)
  Lucene includes a queryparser that supports the creation of Lucene queries from XML.
  The queries supported by lucene.queryparser.xml.CoreParser are now supported by the newly
  created solr.search.SolrCoreParser and in future SolrCoreParser could support additional
  queries also.
  Example: <BooleanQuery fieldName="description">
             <Clause occurs="must"> <TermQuery>shirt</TermQuery> </Clause>
             <Clause occurs="mustnot"> <TermQuery>plain</TermQuery> </Clause>
             <Clause occurs="should"> <TermQuery>cotton</TermQuery> </Clause>
             <Clause occurs="must">
               <BooleanQuery fieldName="size">
                 <Clause occurs="should"> <TermsQuery>S M L</TermsQuery> </Clause>
               </BooleanQuery>
             </Clause>
           </BooleanQuery>
  (Erik Hatcher, Karl Wettin, Daniel Collins, Nathan Visagan, Ahmet Arslan, Christine Poerschke)

* SOLR-8312: Add domain size and numBuckets to facet telemetry info (facet debug info
  for the new Facet Module).  (Michael Sun, yonik)

* SOLR-8534: Add generic support for collection APIs to be async. Thus more actions benefit from having async
  support. The commands that additionally get async support are: delete/reload collection, create/delete alias,
  create/delete shard, delete replica, add/delete replica property, add/remove role,
  overseer status, balance shard unique, rebalance leaders, modify collection, migrate state format (Varun Thacker)

* SOLR-4619: Improve PreAnalyzedField query analysis. (Andrzej Bialecki, Steve Rowe)

* SOLR-8560: Added RequestStatusState enum which can be used when comparing states of
  asynchronous requests. (Shai Erera)

* SOLR-8586: added index fingerprint, a hash over all versions currently in the index.
  PeerSync now uses this to check if replicas are in sync. (yonik)

* SOLR-8500: Allow the number of threads ConcurrentUpdateSolrClient StreamingSolrClients configurable by a
  system property. NOTE: this is an expert option and can result in more often needing to do full index replication
  for recovery, the sweet spot for using this is very high volume, leader-only indexing. (Tim Potter, Erick Erickson)

* SOLR-8642: SOLR allows creation of collections with invalid names
  (Jason Gerlowski via Erick Erickson)

* SOLR-8621: Deprecate <mergePolicy> in favor of <mergePolicyFactory>. It allows to configure
  both the "simple" merge policies, but also more advanced ones, e.g. UpgradeIndexMergePolicy.
  (Christine Poerschke, Shai Erera)

* SOLR-8648: DELETESTATUS API for selective deletion and flushing of stored async collection API responses.
  (Anshum Gupta)

* SOLR-8466: adding facet.method=uif to bring back UnInvertedField faceting which is used to work on
  facet.method=fc. It's more performant for rarely changing indexes. Note: it ignores prefix and contains yet.
  (Jamie Johnson via Mikhail Khludnev)

Bug Fixes
----------------------

* SOLR-8175: Word Break Spellchecker would throw AIOOBE with certain queries containing
   "should" clauses. (Ryan Josal via James Dyer)

* SOLR-2556: The default spellcheck query converter was ignoring terms consisting entirely
  of digits. (James Dyer)

* SOLR-8366: ConcurrentUpdateSolrClient attempts to use response's content type as charset encoding
  for parsing exception. (shalin)

* SOLR-6271: Fix ConjunctionSolrSpellChecker to not compare StringDistance by instance.
  (Igor Kostromin via James Dyer)

* SOLR-7304: Fix Spellcheck Collate to not invalidate range queries. (James Dyer)

* SOLR-8373: KerberosPlugin: Using multiple nodes on same machine leads clients to
  fetch TGT for every request (Ishan Chattopadhyaya via noble)

* SOLR-8367: Fix the LeaderInitiatedRecovery 'all replicas participate' fail-safe.
  (Mark Miller, Mike Drob)

* SOLR-8401: Windows start script fails when executed from a different drive.
  (Nicolas Gavalda via Erick Erickson)

* SOLR-6992: Fix "Files" UI to show the managed-schema file as well.
  (Shawn Heisey, Varun Thacker)

* SOLR-2649: MM ignored in edismax queries with operators.
  (Greg Pendlebury, Jan Høydahl et. al. via Erick Erickson)

* SOLR-8372: Canceled recovery can rarely lead to inconsistent shards:
  If a replica is recovering via index replication, and that recovery fails
  (for example if the leader goes down), and then some more updates are received
  (there could be a few left to be processed from the leader that just went down),
  and then that replica is brought down, it will think it is up-to-date when
  restarted. (shalin, Mark Miller, yonik)

* SOLR-8419: TermVectorComponent for distributed search when distrib.singlePass could include term
  vectors for documents that matched the query yet weren't in the returned documents. (David Smiley)

* SOLR-8015: HdfsLock may fail to close a FileSystem instance if it cannot immediately
  obtain an index lock. (Mark Miller)

* SOLR-8422: When authentication enabled, requests fail if sent to a node that doesn't host
  the collection (noble)

* SOLR-8059: &debug=results for distributed search when distrib.singlePass (sometimes activated
  automatically) could result in an NPE. (David Smiley, Markus Jelsma)

* SOLR-8460: /analysis/field could throw exceptions for custom attributes. (David Smiley, Uwe Schindler)

* SOLR-8276: Atomic updates and realtime-get do not work with non-stored docvalues.
  (Ishan Chattopadhyaya, yonik via shalin)

* SOLR-7462: AIOOBE in RecordingJSONParser (Scott Dawson, noble)

* SOLR-8494: SimplePostTool and therefore the bin/post script cannot upload files larger than 2.1GB. (shalin)

* SOLR-8451: We should not call method.abort in HttpSolrClient or HttpSolrCall#remoteQuery and
  HttpSolrCall#remoteQuery should not close streams. (Mark Miller)

* SOLR-8450: Our HttpClient retry policy is too permissive. (Mark Miller, shalin)

* SOLR-8533: Raise default maxUpdateConnections and maxUpdateConnectionsPerHost to 100k each.
  (Mark Miller)

* SOLR-8453: Solr should attempt to consume the request inputstream on errors as we cannot
  count on the container to do it. (Mark Miller, Greg Wilkins, yonik, Joakim Erdfelt)

* SOLR-6279: cores?action=UNLOAD now waits for the core to close before unregistering it from ZK.
  (Christine Poerschke)

* SOLR-2798: Fixed local params to work correctly with multivalued params
  (Demian Katz via hossman)

* SOLR-8541: Highlighting a geo RPT field would throw an NPE instead of doing nothing.
  (Pawel Rog via David Smiley)

* SOLR-8548: Core discovery was not following symlinks (Aaron LaBella via Alan
  Woodward)

* SOLR-8564: Fix Embedded ZooKeeper to use <solrHome>/zoo_data for it's data directory

* SOLR-8371: Try and prevent too many recovery requests from stacking up and clean up some faulty
  cancel recovery logic. (Mark Miller)

* SOLR-8582 : memory leak in JsonRecordReader affecting /update/json/docs. Large payloads
  cause OOM (noble, shalin)

* SOLR-8605: Regular expression queries starting with escaped forward slash caused
  an exception. (Scott Blum, yonik)

* SOLR-8607: The Schema API refuses to add new fields that match existing dynamic fields.
  (Jan Høydahl, Steve Rowe)

* SOLR-8575: Fix HDFSLogReader replay status numbers, a performance bug where we can reopen
  FSDataInputStream much too often, and an hdfs tlog data integrity bug.
  (Mark Miller, Patrick Dvorack, yonik)

* SOLR-8651: The commitWithin parameter is not passed on for deleteById in UpdateRequest in
  distributed queries (Jessica Cheng Mallet via Erick Erickson)

* SOLR-8551: Make collection deletion more robust. (Mark Miller)

Optimizations
----------------------

* SOLR-8501: Specify the entity request size when known in HttpSolrClient. (Mark Miller)

* SOLR-8615: Just like creating cores, we should use multiple threads when closing cores.
  (Mark Miller)

* SOLR-7281: Add an overseer action to publish an entire node as 'down'. (Mark Miller, shalin)

* SOLR-8669: Non binary responses use chunked encoding because we flush the outputstream early.
  (Mark Miller)

Other Changes
----------------------

* LUCENE-6900: Added test for score ordered grouping, and refactored TopGroupsResultTransformer.
  (David Smiley)

* SOLR-8336: CoreDescriptor now takes a Path for its instance directory, rather
  than a String (Alan Woodward)

  (ehatcher, Shawn Heisey, hossman)

* SOLR-8357: UpdateLog.RecentUpdates now implements Closeable (Alan Woodward)

* SOLR-8339: Refactor SolrDocument and SolrInputDocument to have a common base abstract class
  called SolrDocumentBase. Deprecated methods toSolrInputDocument and toSolrDocument in ClientUtils.
  (Ishan Chattopadhyaya via shalin)

* SOLR-8353: Support regex for skipping license checksums (Gregory Chanan)

* SOLR-8313: SimpleQueryParser doesn't use MultiTermAnalysis for Fuzzy Queries (Tom Hill via Erick Erickson)

* SOLR-8359: Restrict child classes from using parent logger's state
  (Jason Gerlowski, Mike Drob, Anshum Gupta)

* SOLR-8131: All example config sets now explicitly use the ManagedIndexSchemaFactory
  instead of ClassicIndexSchemaFactory. This means that the Schema APIs ( /<collection>/schema )
  are enabled by default and the schema is mutable. The schema file will be called managed-schema
  (Uwe Schindler, shalin, Varun Thacker)

* SOLR-8381: Cleanup data_driven managed-schema and solrconfig.xml files. Commented out copyFields are removed
  and solrconfig.xml doesn't refer to field which are not defined. (Varun Thacker)

* SOLR-7774: revise BasicDistributedZkTest.test logic w.r.t. 'commitWithin did not work on some nodes'
  (Christine Poerschke)

* SOLR-8360: simplify ExternalFileField.getValueSource implementation (Christine Poerschke)

* SOLR-8387: All example configs shipped with Solr explicitly use ManagedIndexSchemaFactory, the schema file will
  be called managed-schema instead of schema.xml . It is not advised to use hand edit the managed-schema. You should
  use the schema APIs instead ( /<collection>/schema ) . If you do not want this behaviour in the example configs,
  before you start solr rename managed-schema to schema.xml and change the schemaFactory in solrconfig.xml file
  to explicitly use ClassicIndexSchemaFactory instead : <schemaFactory class="ClassicIndexSchemaFactory"/>
  (Varun Thacker)

* SOLR-8305: replace LatLonType.getValueSource's QParser use (Christine Poerschke)

* SOLR-8388: factor out response/TestSolrQueryResponse.java from servlet/ResponseHeaderTest.java
  more TestSolrQueryResponse.java tests; add SolrReturnFields.toString method, ReturnFieldsTest.testToString test;
  (Christine Poerschke)

* SOLR-8383: SolrCore.java + QParserPlugin.java container initialCapacity tweaks
  (Christine Poerschke, Mike Drob)

* SOLR-8414: AbstractDistribZkTestBase.verifyReplicaStatus could throw NPE (Christine Poerschke)

* SOLR-8410: Add all read paths to 'read' permission in RuleBasedAuthorizationPlugin (noble)

* SOLR-8279: Add a new test fault injection approach and a new SolrCloud test that stops and starts the cluster
  while indexing data and with random faults. (Mark Miller)

* SOLR-8419: TermVectorComponent for distributed search now requires a uniqueKey in the schema.  Also, it no longer
  returns "uniqueKeyField" in the response. (David Smiley)

* SOLR-8317: add & use responseHeader and response accessors to SolrQueryResponse. (Christine Poerschke)

* SOLR-8452: replace "partialResults" occurrences with SolrQueryResponse.RESPONSE_HEADER_PARTIAL_RESULTS_KEY
  (Christine Poerschke)

* SOLR-8454: ZkStateReader logging improvements and cleanup of dead code (Shai Erera, Anshum Gupta)

* SOLR-8455: RecovertStrategy logging improvements and sleep-between-recovery-attempts bug fix.
  (Shai Erera)

* SOLR-8481: TestSearchPerf no longer needs to duplicate SolrIndexSearcher.(NO_CHECK_QCACHE|NO_CHECK_FILTERCACHE)
  (Christine Poerschke)

* SOLR-8486: No longer require jar/unzip for bin/solr (Steven E. Harris, janhoy)

* SOLR-8483: relocate 'IMPORTANT NOTE' in open-exchange-rates.json test-file to avoid
  OpenExchangeRatesOrgProvider.java warnings (Christine Poerschke)

* SOLR-8489: TestMiniSolrCloudCluster.createCollection to support extra & alternative collectionProperties
  (Christine Poerschke)

* SOLR-8482: add & use QueryCommand.[gs]etTerminateEarly accessors. (Christine Poerschke)

* SOLR-8498: Improve error message when a large value is stored in an indexed string field. (shalin)

* SOLR-8484: refactor update/SolrIndexConfig.LOCK_TYPE_* into core/DirectoryFactory.LOCK_TYPE_*
  (Christine Poerschke)

* SOLR-8504: (IndexSchema|SolrIndexConfig)Test: private static finals for
  solrconfig.xml and schema.xml String literals. (Christine Poerschke)

* SOLR-8505: core/DirectoryFactory.LOCK_TYPE_HDFS - add & use it instead of String literals
  (Christine Poerschke)

  create a core with the same name (Varun Thacker)

* SOLR-8555: SearchGroupShardResponseProcessor (initialCapacity) tweaks (Christine Poerschke)

* LUCENE-6978: Refactor several code places that lookup locales
  by string name to use BCP47 locale tag instead. LuceneTestCase
  now also prints locales on failing tests this way. In addition,
  several places in Solr now additionally support BCP47 in config
  files.  (Uwe Schindler, Robert Muir)

* SOLR-7907: Remove CLUSTERSTATUS related exclusivity checks while running commands in the Overseer because the
  CLUSTERSTATUS request is served by the individual nodes itself and not via the Overseer node (Varun Thacker)

* SOLR-8566: various initialCapacity tweaks (Fix Versions: trunk 5.5)
  (Christine Poerschke)

* SOLR-8565: add & use CommonParams.(ROWS|START)_DEFAULT constants (Christine Poerschke)

  (Erik Hatcher, Erick Erickson)

* SOLR-3141: Warn in logs when expensive optimize calls are made (yonik, janhoy)

==================  5.4.1 ==================

Bug Fixes
----------------------

* SOLR-8460: /analysis/field could throw exceptions for custom attributes. (David Smiley, Uwe Schindler)

* SOLR-8373: KerberosPlugin: Using multiple nodes on same machine leads clients to
  fetch TGT for every request (Ishan Chattopadhyaya via noble)

* SOLR-8059: &debug=results for distributed search when distrib.singlePass (sometimes activated
  automatically) could result in an NPE. (David Smiley, Markus Jelsma)

* SOLR-8422: When authentication enabled, requests fail if sent to a node that doesn't host
  the collection (noble)

* SOLR-7462: AIOOBE in RecordingJSONParser (Scott Dawson, noble)

* SOLR-8496: SolrIndexSearcher.getDocSet(List<Query>) incorrectly included deleted documents
  when all of the queries were uncached (or there was no filter cache).  This caused
  multi-select faceting (including the JSON Facet API) to include deleted doc counts
  when the remaining non-excluded filters were all uncached.  This bug was first introduced in 5.3.0
  (Andreas Müller, Vasiliy Bout, Erick Erickson, Shawn Heisey, Hossman, yonik)

* SOLR-8418: Adapt to changes in LUCENE-6590 for use of boosts with MLTHandler and
  Simple/CloudMLTQParser (Jens Wille, Ramkumar Aiyengar)

New Features
----------------------

  (pkiauth.ttl) (noble)

==================  5.4.0 ==================

Consult the LUCENE_CHANGES.txt file for additional, low level, changes in this release

Versions of Major Components
---------------------
Apache Tika 1.7
Carrot2 3.10.4
Velocity 1.7 and Velocity Tools 2.0
Apache UIMA 2.3.1
Apache ZooKeeper 3.4.6
Jetty 9.2.13.v20150730

Upgrading from Solr 5.3
-----------------------

* DefaultSimilarityFactory has been renamed to ClassicSimilarityFactory to match the underlying rename of
  DefaultSimilarity to ClassicSimilarity and the (eventual) move away from using it as a default.
  If you currently have DefaultSimilarityFactory explicitly referenced in your schema.xml, you will now get
  a warning urging you to edit your config to use the functionally identical ClassicSimilarityFactory.
  DefaultSimilarityFactory will be removed completely in Solr 6.  See SOLR-8239 for more details.

* SOLR-7859: The following APIs are now deprecated:
  - SolrCore.getStartTime: Use SolrCore.getStartTimeStamp instead.
  - SolrIndexSearcher.getOpenTime: Use SolrIndexSearcher.getOpenTimeStamp instead.

* SOLR-8307: EmptyEntityResolver was moved from core to solrj, and moved from the org.apache.solr.util
  package to org.apache.solr.common.  If you are using this class, you will need to adjust the import package.

* Logger declarations in most source files have changed to code that
  no longer needs to explicitly state the class name.  This fixes situations
  where a logger for a different class was incorrectly used. See SOLR-8324
  and its sub-issues for details.

  is anywhere from 20% to over 100% faster and produces less garbage on average.
  (yonik)

* SOLR-6760: New optimized DistributedQueue implementation for overseer increases
  message processing performance by ~470%.
  (Noble Paul, Scott Blum, shalin)

* SOLR-6629: Watch /collections zk node on all nodes so that cluster state updates
  are more efficient especially when cluster has a mix of collections in stateFormat=1
  and stateFormat=2. (Scott Blum, shalin)

* SOLR-7971: Reduce memory allocated by JavaBinCodec to encode small strings by an amount
  equal to the string.length(). JavaBinCodec now uses a double pass approach to write strings
  larger than 64KB to avoid allocating buffer memory equal to string's UTF8 size.
  (yonik, Steve Rowe, Mikhail Khludnev, Noble Paul, shalin)

* SOLR-7983: Utils.toUTF8 uses larger buffer than necessary for holding UTF8 data. (shalin)

* SOLR-8222: JSON Facet API optimization to faceting by count on docvalue fields (or indexed fields
  with method=dv) when there are multiple hits expected for enoug buckets. For example, this
  more than doubled the performance of faceting 5M documents over a field with 1M unique values.
  (yonik)

  (Erik Hatcher)

==================  5.3.0 ==================

Consult the LUCENE_CHANGES.txt file for additional, low level, changes in this release

Versions of Major Components
---------------------
Apache Tika 1.7
Carrot2 3.9.0
Velocity 1.7 and Velocity Tools 2.0
Apache UIMA 2.3.1
Apache ZooKeeper 3.4.6
Jetty 9.2.11.v20150529

Upgrading from Solr 5.2
-----------------------

* SolrJ's CollectionAdminRequest class is now marked as abstract. Use one of its concrete
  sub-classes instead.

* Solr no longer supports forcefully unlocking an index.
  This is no longer supported by the underlying Lucene locking
  framework. The setting in solrconfig.xml has no effect anymore.
  Background: If you use native lock factory, unlocking should
  not be needed, because the locks are cleared after process
  shutdown automatically by the operating system. If you are
  using simple lock factory (not recommended) or hdfs lock
  factory, you may need to manually unlock by deleting the lock
  file from filesystem / HDFS.

* The zkCredientialsProvider element in solrcloud section of solr.xml is now deprecated.
  Use the correct spelling (zkCredentialsProvider) instead.

* class TransformerWithContext is deprecated . Use DocTransformer directly

* The "name" parameter in ADDREPLICA Collections API call has be deprecated. One cannot specify
  the core name for a replica. See SOLR-7499 for more info.

* The ShardHandler interface has changed. The interface used to provide a
  `checkDistributed` function which doubled up in purpose to determine if the
  request is distributed, and to prepare for distributed requests. This unfortunately
  meant that the object had to be instantiated even when the request is not
  distributed. The task of initially determining if the request is distributed
  is now done by SearchHandler using the distrib/shards parameters, and a
  ShardHandler object is created only if the request is distributed. The interface
  now has a `prepDistributed` function instead of the `checkDistributed` function,
  which can then be used to prepare for the distributed request. Users with custom
  ShardHandler implementations would need to modify their code to this effect.

* The system property "solr.solrxml.location" is not supported any more. Now, solr.xml is first
  looked up in zookeeper, and if not found, fallback to SOLR_HOME. See SOLR-7735 for more info.

Detailed Change List
----------------------

New Features
----------------------

* SOLR-7724: SolrJ now supports parsing the output of the clustering component.

  requests. (Mark Miller, Timothy Potter, Ramkumar Aiyengar)

* SOLR-4506: Clean-up old (unused) index directories in the background after initializing a new index;

* SOLR-7529: CoreAdminHandler Reload throws NPE on null core name instead of a bad
  request error. (Jellyfrog, Edward Ribeiro via shalin)

* SOLR-7781: JSON Facet API: Terms facet on string/text fields with sub-facets caused
  a bug that resulted in filter cache lookup misses as well as the filter cache
  exceeding it's configured size. (yonik)

* SOLR-7810: map-reduce contrib script to set classpath for convenience refers to example

  cache method calls) (Christine Poerschke via Ramkumar Aiyengar)

* SOLR-7455: Terms facets with the JSON Facet API now defer calculating non-sorting stats

  proportional to the number of non-sorting statistics being calculated in addition to
  the number of buckets and domain documents.
  For Example: The facet request  {type:terms, field:field1, facet:{x:"unique(field2)"}}
  saw a 7x improvement when field1 and 1M unique terms and field2 had 1000 unique terms.

  ERROR to WARN for zkcli.{sh,cmd} only.
  (Oliver Schrenk, Tim Potter, Uwe Schindler, shalin)

* SOLR-7735: Look for solr.xml in Zookeeper by default in SolrCloud mode. If not found, it will be loaded

Consult the LUCENE_CHANGES.txt file for additional, low level, changes in this release

Versions of Major Components
---------------------
Apache Tika 1.7
Carrot2 3.9.0
Velocity 1.7 and Velocity Tools 2.0
Apache UIMA 2.3.1
Apache ZooKeeper 3.4.6
Jetty 9.2.10.v20150310

Upgrading from Solr 5.1
-----------------------

* A bug was introduced in Solr 4.10 that caused index time document boosts to trigger excessive field
  boosts in multivalued fields -- the result being that some field norms might be excessively large.
  This bug has now been fixed, but users of document boosts are strongly encouraged to re-index.
  See SOLR-7335 for more details.

* The Slice and Replica classes have been changed to use State enums instead of string constants
  to track the respective stats.  Advanced users with client code manipulating these objects will
  need to update their code accordingly.  See SOLR-7325 and SOLR-7336 for more info.

* Solr has internally been upgraded to use Jetty 9. See SOLR-4839 for full details, but there are
  a few key details all Solr users should know when upgrading:

  - It is no longer possible to run "java -jar start.jar" from inside the server directory.
    The bin/solr script is the only supported way to run Solr. This is necessary to support
    HTTP and HTTPS modules in Jetty which can be selectively enabled by the bin/solr scripts.
    In case you have a pressing need to run solr the old way, you can run
    "java -jar start.jar --module=http" to get the same behavior as before.

  - The way SSL support is configured has been changed. Before this release,
    the SOLR_SSL_OPTS property configured in solr.in.sh (linux/mac) or solr.in.cmd (windows)
    was used to enable/disable SSL but starting in 5.2.0, new properties named as
    SOLR_SSL_KEY_STORE, SOLR_SSL_KEY_STORE_PASSWORD, SOLR_SSL_TRUST_STORE,
    SOLR_SSL_TRUST_STORE_PASSWORD, SOLR_SSL_NEED_CLIENT_AUTH and SOLR_SSL_WANT_CLIENT_AUTH
    have been introduced. The bin/solr scripts configure the SOLR_SSL_OPTS property
    automatically based on the above new properties.

    You should *not* configure the SOLR_SSL_OPTS property directly inside solr.in.{sh,cmd}.

  - Support for SOLR_SSL_PORT property has been removed. Instead use the regular SOLR_PORT
    property or specify the port while invoking the bin/solr script using the "-p" switch.

  - Furthermore, it is now possible to configure the HTTP client with
    different SSL properties than the ones used for Jetty using the same files.

  - Please refer to the "Enabling SSL" section in the Solr Reference Guide for complete details.

* Support for pathPrefix has been completely removed from Solr. Since 5.0, Solr no longer officially
  supports being run as a webapp but allowed users to play around with the web.xml to have a path prefix.
  That would no longer be true. See SOLR-7500 for more info.

* The package structure under org.apache.solr.client.solrj.io has been changed to support
  the Streaming Expression Language (SOLR-7377). Any code written with the 5.1 Streaming API will have to
  be updated to reflect these changes.

* Merge Policy's "noCFSRatio" is no longer set based on <useCompoundFile> element in the indexConfig section
  of solrconfig.xml. This means that Solr will start using Lucene's default for MP "noCFSRatio", with this
  new default Solr will decide if a segment should use cfs or not based on the size of the segment in relation
  the size of the complete index. For TieredMergePolicy for example (current default), segments will use cfs
  if they are less than 10% of the index, otherwise cfs is disabled. Old values for this setting
  (1.0 for useCompoundFile=true and 0.0 for useCompoundFile=false) as well as any other value can be set
  inside the <mergePolicy> element in solrconfig.xml. <useCompoundFile> will only apply to newly created
  segments. See SOLR-7463.


Detailed Change List

    http://localhost:8983/solr/techproducts/replication?command=restorestatus
  (Varun Thacker, noble, shalin)

* SOLR-7241, SOLR-7263, SOLR-7279, SOLR-7300, SOLR-7396, SOLR-7397, SOLR-7492:

* SOLR-7422: Optional flatter form for the JSON Facet API via a "type" parameter:
    top_authors : { type:terms, field:author, limit:5 } is equivalent to
    top_authors : { terms : { field:author, limit:5  } }
  (yonik)

* SOLR-7176: zkcli script can perfrom the CLUSTERPROP command without a running Solr cluster
  (Hrishikesh Gadre, Per Steffensen, Noble Paul)

* SOLR-7417: JSON Facet API - unique() is now implemented for numeric and date fields.
  (yonik)

* SOLR-7406: Add a new "facet.range.method" parameter to let users choose how to do range
  faceting between an implementation based on filters (previous algorithm, using
  "facet.range.method=filter") or DocValues ("facet.range.method=dv").
  Input parameters and output of both methods are the same. (Tomás Fernández Löbbe)

* SOLR-7473: Facet Module (Json Facet API) range faceting now supports the "mincount"
  parameter in range facets to supress buckets less than that count.  The default
  for "mincount" remains 0 for range faceting.
  Example: prices:{ type:range, field:price, mincount:1, start:0, end:100, gap:10 }
  (yonik)

* SOLR-7437: Make HDFS transaction log replication factor configurable. (Mark Miller)

* SOLR-7477: Multi-select faceting support for the Facet Module via the "excludeTags"
  parameter which disregards any matching tagged filters for that facet.  Example:
  & q=shoes
  & fq={!tag=COLOR}color:blue
  & json.facet={ colors:{type:terms, field:color, excludeTags=COLOR} }
  (yonik)

* SOLR-7522: Facet Module - Implement field/terms faceting over single-valued
  numeric fields. (yonik)

* SOLR-7275: Authorization framework for Solr. It defines an interface and a mechanism to create,
  load, and use an Authorization plugin. (Noble Paul, Ishan Chattopadhyaya, Anshum Gupta)

* SOLR-7377: Solr Streaming Expressions (Dennis Gove, Joel Bernstein, Steven Bower)

* SOLR-7553: Facet Analytics Module: new "hll" function that uses HyperLogLog to calculate
  distributed cardinality.  The original "unique" function is still available.
  Example:  json.facet={ numProducts : "hll(product_id)" }
  (yonik)

* SOLR-7546: bin/post (and SimplePostTool in -Dauto=yes mode) now sends rather than skips files
  without a known content type, as "application/octet-stream", provided it still is in the
  allowed filetypes setting. (ehatcher)

* SOLR-7274: Pluggable authentication module in Solr. This defines an interface and a mechanism to create,
  load, and use an Authentication plugin. (Noble Paul, Ishan Chattopadhyaya, Gregory Chanan, Anshum Gupta)

* SOLR-7379: (experimental) New spatial RptWithGeometrySpatialField, based on CompositeSpatialStrategy,
  which blends RPT indexes for speed with serialized geometry for accuracy.  Includes a Lucene segment based
  in-memory shape cache. (David Smiley)

* SOLR-7465, SOLR-7610: New file indexing example, under example/files.  (Esther Quansah, Erik Hatcher)

* SOLR-7468: Kerberos authenticaion plugin for Solr. This would allow running a Kerberized Solr.

  (JSON Facet API).  (yonik)

* SOLR-7440: DebugComponent does not return the right requestPurpose for pivot facet refinements.
  (shalin)

* SOLR-7408: Listeners set by SolrCores on config directories in ZK could be removed if collections
  are created/deleted in paralle against the same config set. (Shai Erera, Anshum Gupta)

* SOLR-7450: Fix edge case which could cause `bin/solr stop` to hang forever
  (Ramkumar Aiyengar)

* SOLR-7157: initParams must support tags other than appends, defaults and, invariants (Noble Paul)

* SOLR-7387: Facet Module - distributed search didn't work when sorting terms
  facet by min, max, avg, or unique functions.  (yonik)

* SOLR-7469: Fix check-licenses to correctly detect if start.jar.sha1 is incorrect (hossman)

* SOLR-7449: solr/server/etc/jetty-https-ssl.xml hard codes the key store file and password rather
  than pulling them from the sysprops defined in solr/bin/solr.in.{sh,cmd}

* SOLR-7470: Fix sample data to eliminate file order dependency for successful indexing, also
  fixed SolrCloudExampleTest to help catch this in the future. (hossman)

* SOLR-7478: UpdateLog#close shuts down it's executor with interrupts before running it's close logic,
  possibly preventing a clean close. (Mark Miller)

* SOLR-7494: Facet Module - unique() facet function was wildly inaccurate for high cardinality
  fields. (Andy Crossen, yonik)

  are not used in copyFields (Shingo Sasaki via hossman)

* SOLR-7585: Fix NoSuchElementException in LFUCache resulting from heavy writes
  making concurrent put() calls. (Maciej Zasada via Shawn Heisey)

* SOLR-7587: Seeding bucket versions from index when the firstSearcher event fires has a race condition
  that leads to an infinite wait on VersionInfo's ReentrantReadWriteLock because the read-lock acquired
  during a commit cannot be upgraded to a write-lock needed to block updates; solution is to move the
  call out of the firstSearcher event path and into the SolrCore constructor. (Timothy Potter)

* SOLR-7625: Ensure that the max value for seeding version buckets is updated after recovery even if
  the UpdateLog is not replayed. (Timothy Potter)

Optimizations
----------------------

* SOLR-7324: IndexFetcher does not need to call isIndexStale if full copy is already needed
  (Stephan Lagraulet via Varun Thacker)

* SOLR-7547: Short circuit SolrDisptachFilter for static content request. Right now it creates
  a new HttpSolrCall object and tries to process it. (Anshum Gupta)

* SOLR-7333: Make the poll queue time a leader uses when distributing updates to replicas
  configurable and use knowledge that a batch is being processed to poll efficiently.
  (Timothy Potter)

* SOLR-7332: Initialize the highest value for all version buckets with the max value from
  the index or recent updates to avoid unnecessary lookups to the index to check for reordered
  updates when processing new documents. (Timothy Potter, yonik)

* SOLR-5855: DefaultSolrHighlighter now re-uses the document's term vectors instance when highlighting
  more than one field. Applies to the standard and FVH highlighters. (David Smiley, Daniel Debray)

Other Changes
----------------------

* SOLR-6865: Upgrade HttpClient to 4.4.1 (Shawn Heisey)

* SOLR-7358: TestRestoreCore fails in Windows (Ishan Chattopadhyaya via Varun Thacker)

* SOLR-7371: Make DocSet implement Accountable to estimate memory usage. (yonik, shalin)

* SOLR-7381: Improve logging by adding node name in MDC in SolrCloud mode and adding MDC to
  all thread pools. A new MDCAwareThreadPoolExecutor is introduced and usages of
  Executors#newFixedThreadPool, #newSingleThreadExecutor, #newCachedThreadPool as well as
  ThreadPoolExecutor directly is now forbidden in Solr. MDC keys are now exposed in thread
  names automatically so that a thread dump can give hints on what the thread was doing.
  Uncaught exceptions thrown by tasks in the pool are logged along with submitter's stack trace.
  (shalin)

* SOLR-7384: Fix spurious failures in FullSolrCloudDistribCmdsTest. (shalin)

* SOLR-6692: Default highlighter changes:
  - hl.maxAnalyzedChars now applies cumulatively on a multi-valied field.
  - fragment ranking on a multi-valued field should be more relevant.
  - hl.usePhraseHighlighter is now toggleable on a per-field basis.
  - Much more extensible (get values from another source; return snippet scores and offsets).
  - When using hl.maxMultiValuedToMatch with hl.preserveMulti, only count matched snippets.
  (David Smiley)

* SOLR-6886: Removed redundant size check and added missing calls to
  DelegatingCollection.finish inside Grouping code.  (Christine Poerschke via shalin)

* SOLR-7421: RecoveryAfterSoftCommitTest fails frequently on Jenkins due to full index
  replication taking longer than 30 seconds. (Timothy Potter, shalin)

* SOLR-7081: Add new test case to test if create/delete/re-create collections work.
  (Christine Poerschke via Ramkumar Aiyengar)

* SOLR-7467: Upgrade t-digest to 3.1 (hossman)

* SOLR-7471: Stop requiring docValues for interval faceting (Tomás Fernández Löbbe)

* SOLR-7391: Use a time based expiration cache for one off HDFS FileSystem instances.
  (Mark Miller)

  no or multiple shards (Christine Poerschke, Ramkumar Aiyengar)

* SOLR-7425: Improve MDC based logging format. (Mark Miller)

* SOLR-4839: Upgrade Jetty to 9.2.10.v20150310 and restlet-jee to 2.3.0
  (Bill Bell, Timothy Potter, Uwe Schindler, Mark Miller, Steve Rowe, Steve Davids, shalin)

* SOLR-7457: Make DirectoryFactory publishing MBeanInfo extensible.
  (Mike Drob via Mark Miller)

* SOLR-7325: Slice.getState() now returns a State enum instead of a String. This helps
  clarify the states a Slice can be in, as well comparing the state of a Slice.
  (Shai Erera)

* SOLR-7336: Added Replica.getState() and removed ZkStateReader state-related constants.
  You should use Replica.State to compare a replica's state. (Shai Erera)

* SOLR-7487: Fix check-example-lucene-match-version Ant task to check luceneMatchVersion
  in solr/server/solr/configsets instead of example and harden error checking / validation
  logic. (hossman, Timothy Potter)

* SOLR-7409: When there are multiple dataimport handlers defined, the admin UI
  was listing them in a random order.  Now they are sorted in a natural order
  that handles numbers properly. (Jellyfrog via Shawn Heisey)

* SOLR-7484: Refactor SolrDispatchFilter to extract all Solr specific implementation detail
  to HttpSolrCall and also extract methods from within the current SDF.doFilter(..) logic
  making things easier to manage. HttpSolrCall converts the processing to a 3-step process
  i.e. Construct, Init, and Call so the context of the request would be available after Init
   and before the actual call operation. (Anshum Gupta, Noble Paul)

* SOLR-6878: Allow symmetric lists of synonyms to be added using the managed synonym REST
  API to support legacy expand=true type mappings; previously the API only allowed adding
  explicit mappings, with this feature you can now add a list and have the mappings
  expanded when the update is applied (Timothy Potter, Vitaliy Zhovtyuk, hossman)

* SOLR-7102: bin/solr should activate cloud mode if ZK_HOST is set (Timothy Potter)

* SOLR-7500: Remove pathPrefix from SolrDispatchFilter as Solr no longer runs as a part
  of a bigger webapp. (Anshum Gupta)

* SOLR-7243: CloudSolrClient was always returning SERVER_ERROR for exceptions,
  even when a more relevant ErrorCode was available, via SolrException.  Now
  the actual ErrorCode is used when available.
  (Hrishikesh Gadre via Shawn Heisey)

* SOLR-7544: CollectionsHandler refactored to be more modular (Noble Paul)

* SOLR-7532: Removed occurrences of the unused 'commitIntervalLowerBound' property for
  updateHandler elements from Solr configuration. (Marius Grama via shalin)

* SOLR-7541: Removed CollectionsHandler#createNodeIfNotExists. All calls made to this method now call
  ZkCmdExecutor#ensureExists as they were doing the same thing. Also ZkCmdExecutor#ensureExists now respects the
  CreateMode passed to it. (Varun Thacker)

* SOLR-6820: Make the number of version buckets used by the UpdateLog configurable as
  increasing beyond the default 256 has been shown to help with high volume indexing
  performance in SolrCloud; helps overcome a limitation where Lucene uses the request
  thread to perform expensive index housekeeping work. (Mark Miller, yonik, Timothy Potter)

* SOLR-7463: Stop forcing MergePolicy's "NoCFSRatio" based on the IWC "useCompoundFile" configuration
  (Tomás Fernández Löbbe)

* SOLR-7582: Allow auto-commit to be set with system properties in data_driven_schema_configs and
  enable auto soft-commits for the bin/solr -e cloud example using the Config API.
  (Timothy Potter)

* SOLR-7183: Fix Locale blacklisting for Minikdc based tests. (Ishan Chattopadhyaya, hossman
  via Anshum Gupta)

* SOLR-7662: Refactored response writing to consolidate the logic in  one place (Noble Paul)

* SOLR-7110: Added option to optimize JavaBinCodec to minimize string Object creation (Noble Paul)

Apache ZooKeeper 3.4.6
Jetty 8.1.10.v20130312

Upgrading from Solr 5.0
-----------------------

* SolrClient query functions now declare themselves as throwing IOException in
  addition to SolrServerException, to bring them in line with the update
  functions.

* SolrRequest.process() is now final.  Subclasses should instead be parameterized
  by their corresponding SolrResponse type, and implement createResponse()

* The signature of SolrDispatchFilter.createCoreContainer() has changed to take
  (String,Properties) arguments

* Deprecated the 'lib' option added to create-requesthandler as part of SOLR-6801 in 5.0 release.

==================  5.0.0 ==================

Consult the LUCENE_CHANGES.txt file for additional, low level, changes in this release.

NOTE: Solr 5.0 only supports creating and removing SolrCloud collections through
      the collections API, unlike previous versions. While not using the
      collections API may still work in 5.0, it is unsupported, not recommended,
      and the behavior will change in a 5.x release.

Versions of Major Components
---------------------
Apache Tika 1.7
Carrot2 3.9.0
Velocity 1.7 and Velocity Tools 2.0
Apache UIMA 2.3.1
Apache ZooKeeper 3.4.6
Jetty 8.1.10.v20130312

Upgrading from Solr 4.x
----------------------

* Apache Solr has no support for Lucene/Solr 3.x and earlier indexes anymore.
  Be sure to run Lucene's IndexUpgrader on the previous 4.10 version if you might
  still have old segments in your index. Alternatively fully optimize your index
  with Solr 4.10 to make sure it consists only of one up-to-date index segment.

* The "file" attribute of infoStream in solrconfig.xml is removed. Control this
  via your logging configuration (org.apache.solr.update.LoggingInfoStream) instead.

* UniqFieldsUpdateProcessorFactory no longer supports the <lst named="fields"> init
  param style that was deprecated in Solr 4.5.  If you are still using this syntax,
  update your configs to use <arr name="fieldName"> instead. See SOLR-4249 for more
  details.

* The following legacy numeric and date field types, deprecated in Solr 4.8, are no
  longer supported: BCDIntField, BCDLongField, BCDStrField, IntField, LongField,
  FloatField, DoubleField, SortableIntField, SortableLongField, SortableFloatField,
  SortableDoubleField, and DateField.  Convert these types in your schema to the
  corresponding Trie-based field type and then re-index.  See SOLR-5936 for more
  information.

* getAnalyzer() in IndexSchema and FieldType that was deprecated in Solr 4.9 has
  been removed.  Use getIndexAnalyzer() instead. See SOLR-6022 for more information.

* The spellcheck response format has changed, affecting xml and json clients.  In
  particular, the "correctlySpelled" and "collations" subsections have been moved outside
  the "suggestions" subsection, and now are directly under "spellcheck".
  See SOLR-3029 for more information.

* The CollectionsAPI SolrJ calls createCollection(), reloadCollection(),
  deleteCollection(), requestStatus(), createShard(), splitShard(), deleteShard(),
  createAlias() and deleteAlias() which were deprecated in 4.11 have been removed.
  The new usage involves a builder style construction of the call.

* The OVERSEERSTATUS API returns new key names for operations such as "create"
  for "createcollection", "delete" for "removecollection" and "deleteshard" for
  "removeshard".

* If you have been using the /update/json/docs to index documents, SOLR-6617 introduces
  backward incompatible change. the key names created are fully qualified paths of keys .
  If you need the old functionality back , please add an extra parameter f=/**
  example: /update/json/docs?f=/**

* Bugs fixed in several ValueSource functions may result in different behavior in
  situations where some documents do not have values for fields wrapped in other value
  sources.  Users who want to preserve the previous behavior may need to wrap fields
  in the "def()" function. Example: changing "fl=sum(fieldA,fieldB)" to
  "fl=sum(def(fieldA,0.0),def(fieldB,0.0))".  See LUCENE-5961 for more details.

* AdminHandlers is deprecated, /admin/* are implicitly defined, /get, /replication and
  handlers are also implicitly registered (refer to SOLR-6792)

* SolrCore.reload(ConfigSet coreConfig, SolrCore prev) was deprecated in 4.10.3 and
  removed in 5.0. use SolrCore.reload(ConfigSet coreConfig). See SOLR-5864.

* The "termIndexInterval" option in solrconfig.xml has been a No-Op in the default codec
  since Solr 4.0, and has been removed completely in 5.0.  If you get an "Illegal parameter
  'termIndexInterval'" error when upgrading, you can safely remove this option from your
  configs.  If you have a strong need to configure this, you must explicitly configure your
  schema with a custom codec.  See SOLR-6560 and for more details.

* The "checkIntegrityAtMerge" option in solrconfig.xml is now a No-Op and should be removed
  from any solrconfig.xml files -- these integrity checks are now done automatically at a very
  low level during the segment merging process.  See SOLR-6834 for more details.

* SimplePostTool (post.jar) no longer defaults to collection1, making either of core/collection
  name or update URL mandatory. An existing call without an explicit update URL needs to now
  have the core/collection name passed as "-Dc=<collection/core name>" e.g.:
    java -jar -Dc=<collection_name> post.jar *.xml (new call with collection name)
  See SOLR-6852 for more details.

* Relative paths specified in the solr.xml coreRootDirectory parameter for core
  discovery are now resolved relative to SOLR_HOME, rather than cwd.  See
  SOLR-6718.

* SolrServer and associated classes have been deprecated.  Applications using
  SolrJ should use the equivalent SolrClient classes instead.

* Spatial fields originating from Solr 4 (e.g. SpatialRecursivePrefixTreeFieldType, BBoxField)
  have the 'units' attribute deprecated, now replaced with 'distanceUnits'.  If you change it to
  a unit other than 'degrees' (or if you don't specify it, which will default to kilometers if
  geo=true), then be sure to update maxDistErr as it's in those units.  If you keep units=degrees
  then it should be backwards compatible but you'll get a deprecation warning on startup.  See
  SOLR-6797.

* The <nrtMode> configuration in solrconfig.xml has been discontinued and should be removed from
  solrconfig.xml. Solr defaults to using NRT searchers regardless of the value in configuration
  and a warning is logged on startup if the solrconfig.xml has <nrtMode> specified.

* There was an old spatial syntax to specify a circle using Circle(x,y d=...) which should be
  replaced with simply using {!geofilt} (if you can) or BUFFER(POINT(x y),d). Likewise a rect syntax
  comprised of minX minY maxX maxY that should now be replaced with
  ENVELOPE(minX, maxX, maxY, minY).

* Due to changes in the underlying commons-codec package, users of the BeiderMorseFilterFactory
  will need to rebuild their indexes after upgrading.  See LUCENE-6058 for more details.

* CachedSqlEntityProcessor has been removed, use SqlEntityProcessor with the
  cacheImpl parameter.

* HttpDataSource has been removed, use URLDataSource instead.

* LegacyHTMLStripCharFilter has been removed

* CoreAdminRequest.persist() call has been removed.  All changes made via
  CoreAdmin are persistent.

* SpellCheckResponse.getSuggestions() and getSuggestionFrequencies() have been
  removed, use getAlternatives() and getAlternativeFrequencies() instead.

* SolrQuery deprecated methods have been removed:
    - setMissing() is now setFacetMissing()
    - getFacetSort() is now getFacetSortString()
    - setFacetSort(boolean) should instead use setFacetSort(String) with
      FacetParams.FACET_SORT_COUNT or FacetParams.FACET_SORT_INDEX
    - setSortField(String, ORDER) should use setSort(SortClause)
    - addSortField(String, ORDER) should use addSort(SortClause)
    - removeSortField(String, ORDER) should use removeSort(SortClause)
    - getSortFields() should use getSorts()
    - set/getQueryType() should use set/getRequestHandler()

* ClientUtil deprecated date methods have been removed, use DateUtil instead

* FacetParams.FacetDateOther has been removed, use FacetRangeOther

* ShardParams.SHARD_KEYS has been removed, use ShardParams._ROUTE_

* The 'old-style' solr.xml format is no longer supported, and cores must be
  defined using core.properties files.  See
  https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/solr/Format+of+solr.xml

* SOLR-6666: Dynamic copy fields are considering all dynamic fields, causing
  a significant performance impact on indexing documents. (Liram Vardi via Erick
  Erickson, Steve Rowe)

  (Uwe Schindler)

==================  4.10.0 =================

Consult the LUCENE_CHANGES.txt file for additional, low level, changes in this release

Versions of Major Components
---------------------
Apache Tika 1.5 (with upgraded Apache POI 3.10.1)
Carrot2 3.9.0
Velocity 1.7 and Velocity Tools 2.0
Apache UIMA 2.3.1
Apache ZooKeeper 3.4.6

Upgrading from Solr 4.9
----------------------

* In Solr 3.6, all primitive field types were changed to omit norms by default when the
  schema version is 1.5 or greater (SOLR-3140), but TrieDateField's default was mistakenly
  not changed.  As of Solr 4.10, TrieDateField omits norms by default (see SOLR-6211).

* Creating a SolrCore via CoreContainer.create() no longer requires an
  additional call to CoreContainer.register() to make it available to clients
  (see SOLR-6170).

* CoreContainer.remove() has been removed.  You should now use CoreContainer.unload() to
  delete a SolrCore (see SOLR-6232).

* solr.xml parsing has been improved to better account for the expected data types of
  various options.  As part of this fix, additional error checking has also been added to
  provide errors in the event of duplicated options, or unknown option names that may
  indicate a typo.  Users who have modified their solr.xml in the past and now upgrade may
  get errors on startup if they have typos or unexpected options specified in their solr.xml
  file.  (See SOLR-5746 for more information.)

Optimizations
---------------------

* LUCENE-5803: Solr's schema now uses DelegatingAnalyzerWrapper. This uses less heap

==================  4.8.0 ==================

Versions of Major Components
---------------------
Apache Tika 1.5
Carrot2 3.9.0
Velocity 1.7 and Velocity Tools 2.0
Apache UIMA 2.3.1
Apache ZooKeeper 3.4.6

Upgrading from Solr 4.7
----------------------

* In previous versions of Solr, Terms that exceeded Lucene's MAX_TERM_LENGTH were
  silently ignored when indexing documents.  Beginning with Solr 4.8, a document
  an error will be generated when attempting to index a document with a term
  that is too large.  If you wish to continue to have large terms ignored,
  use "solr.LengthFilterFactory" in all of your Analyzers.  See LUCENE-5472 for
  more details.

* Solr 4.8 requires Java 7 or greater, Java 8 is verified to be
  compatible and may bring some performance improvements. When using
  Oracle Java 7 or OpenJDK 7, be sure to not use the GA build 147 or
  update versions u40, u45 and u51! We recommend using u55 or later.
  An overview of known JVM bugs can be found on
  https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/lucene/JavaBugs

* ZooKeeper is upgraded from 3.4.5 to 3.4.6.

* <fields> and <types> tags have been deprecated. There is no longer any reason to
  keep them in the schema file, they may be safely removed. This allows intermixing of
  <fieldType>, <field> and <copyField> definitions if desired. Currently, these tags
  are supported so either style may be implemented. TBD is whether they'll be
  deprecated formally for 5.0


Detailed Change List
----------------------

  outside their instance directory. (Alan Woodward, Erick Erickson)

* SOLR-5466: A new List collections and cluster status API which clients can use

  stage gets all fields. Requests with fl=id or fl=id,score are now single-pass.
  (Shawn Smith, Vitaliy Zhovtyuk, shalin)

* SOLR-5783: Requests to open a new searcher will now reuse the current registered
  searcher (w/o additional warming) if possible in situations where the underlying
  index has not changed.  This reduces overhead in situations such as deletes that
  do not modify the index, and/or redundant commits. (hossman)

* SOLR-5884: When recovery is cancelled, any call to the leader to wait to see
  the replica in the right state for recovery should be aborted. (Mark Miller)

Other Changes
---------------------

* SOLR-5909: Upgrade Carrot2 clustering dependency to 3.9.0. (Dawid Weiss)

  registration exists, wait a short time to see if it goes away.
  (Mark Miller)

* LUCENE-5472: IndexWriter.addDocument will now throw an IllegalArgumentException
  if a Term to be indexed exceeds IndexWriter.MAX_TERM_LENGTH.  To recreate previous
  behavior of silently ignoring these terms, use LengthFilter in your Analyzer.
  (hossman, Mike McCandless, Varun Thacker)

==================  4.7.0 ==================

Versions of Major Components
---------------------
Apache Tika 1.4
Carrot2 3.8.0
Velocity 1.7 and Velocity Tools 2.0
Apache UIMA 2.3.1
Apache ZooKeeper 3.4.5

Upgrading from Solr 4.6.0
----------------------

* CloudSolrServer and LBHttpSolrServer no longer declare MalformedURLException
  as thrown from their constructors.

* Due to a bug in previous versions the default value of the 'discountOverlap' property
  of DefaultSimilarity was not being set appropriately if you were using the implicit
  DefaultSimilarityFactory instead of explicitly configuring it.  To preserve
  consistent behavior for people who upgrade, the implicit behavior is now contingent
  on the <luceneMatchVersion/> -- discountOverlap=false for 4.6 and below,
  discountOverlap=true for 4.7 and above.  See SOLR-5561 for more information.

  ignoring requests for the results to include the score.
  (Anshum Gupta, Mark Miller, Shawn Heisey)

* SOLR-5371: Solr should consistently call SolrServer#shutdown (Mark Miller)

* SOLR-5363: Solr doesn't start up properly with Log4J2 (Petar Tahchiev via Alan
  Woodward)

* SOLR-5380: Using cloudSolrServer.setDefaultCollection(collectionId) does not
  work as intended for an alias spanning more than 1 collection.
  (Thomas Egense, Shawn Heisey, Mark Miller)

* SOLR-5418: Background merge after field removed from solr.xml causes error.
  (Reported on user's list, Robert M's patch via Erick Erickson)

* SOLR-5318: Creating a core via the admin API doesn't respect transient property
   (Olivier Soyez via Erick Erickson)

* SOLR-5388: Creating a new core via the HTTP API that results in a transient being
  unloaded results in a " Too many close [count:-1]" error.
  (Olivier Soyez via Erick Erickson)

* SOLR-5453: Raise recovery socket read timeouts. (Mark Miller)

* SOLR-5397: Replication can fail silently in some cases. (Mark Miller)

* SOLR-5465: SolrCmdDistributor retry logic has a concurrency race bug.
  (Mark Miller)

* SOLR-5452: Do not attempt to proxy internal update requests. (Mark Miller)

Optimizations
----------------------

* SOLR-5232: SolrCloud should distribute updates via streaming rather than buffering.
  (Mark Miller)

* SOLR-5223: SolrCloud should use the JavaBin binary format for communication by default.
  (Mark Miller)

* SOLR-5370: Requests to recover when an update fails should be done in
  background threads. (Mark Miller)

* LUCENE-5300,LUCENE-5304: Specialized faceting for fields which are declared as
  multi-valued in the schema but are actually single-valued. (Adrien Grand)

Security
----------------------

* SOLR-4882: SolrResourceLoader was restricted to only allow access to resource
  files below the instance dir. The reason for this is security related: Some
  Solr components allow to pass in resource paths via REST parameters
  (e.g. XSL stylesheets, velocity templates,...) and load them via resource
  loader. For backwards compatibility, this security feature can be disabled
  by a new system property: solr.allow.unsafe.resourceloading=true
  (Uwe Schindler)

Other Changes
----------------------

  heap memory is being used by the underlying Lucene index structures.
  (Areek Zillur via Robert Muir)

* SOLR-5241: Fix SimplePostToolTest performance problem - implicit DNS lookups
  (hossman)

* SOLR-5273: Update HttpComponents to 4.2.5 and 4.2.6. (Mark Miller)

* SOLR-5264: Move methods for getting config information from
             FieldMutatingUpdateProcessorFactory to NamedList. (Shawn Heisey)

* SOLR-5319: Remove unused and incorrect router name from Collection ZK nodes.
  (Jessica Cheng via shalin)

* SOLR-5321: Remove unnecessary code in Overseer.updateState method which tries to
  use router name from message where none is ever sent. (shalin)

* SOLR-5401: SolrResourceLoader logs a warning if a deprecated (factory) class
  is used in schema or config.  (Uwe Schindler)

* SOLR-3397: Warn if master or slave replication is enabled in SolrCloud mode. (Erick
  Erickson)

Bug Fixes
----------------------

* SOLR-4590: Collections API should return a nice error when not in SolrCloud mode.
  (Anshum Gupta, Mark Miller)

  cluster watcher. (Jessica Cheng via shalin)

* SOLR-5305: Admin UI - Reloading System-Information on Dashboard does not work
  anymore (steffkes)

* SOLR-5314: Shard split action should use soft commits instead of hard commits
  to make sub shard data visible. (Kalle Aaltonen, shalin)

* SOLR-5327: SOLR-4915, "The root cause should be returned to the user when a SolrCore create
  call fails", was reverted. (Mark Miller)

* SOLR-5317: SolrCore persistence bugs if defining SolrCores in solr.xml.
  (Mark Miller, Yago Riveiro)

 * SOLR-5306: Extra collection creation parameters like collection.configName are
  not being respected. (Mark Miller, Liang Tianyu, Nathan Neulinger)

* SOLR-5325: ZooKeeper connection loss can cause the Overseer to stop processing
  commands. (Christine Poerschke, Mark Miller, Jessica Cheng)

* SOLR-4327: HttpSolrServer can leak connections on errors. (Karl Wright, Mark Miller)

* SOLR-5349: CloudSolrServer - ZK timeout arguments passed to ZkStateReader are flipped.
  (Ricardo Merizalde via shalin)

* SOLR-5330: facet.method=fcs on single values fields could sometimes result
  in incorrect facet labels. (Michael Froh, yonik)


Other Changes
----------------------

* SOLR-5323: Disable ClusteringComponent by default in collection1 example.
  The solr.clustering.enabled system property needs to be set to 'true'
  to enable the clustering contrib (reverts SOLR-4708). (Dawid Weiss)

Velocity 1.7 and Velocity Tools 2.0
Apache UIMA 2.3.1
Apache ZooKeeper 3.4.5

Upgrading from Solr 4.4.0
----------------------

* XML configuration parsing is now more strict about situations where a single
  setting is allowed but multiple values are found.  In the past, one value
  would be chosen arbitrarily and silently.  Starting with 4.5, configuration
  parsing will fail with an error in situations like this.  If you see error
  messages such as "solrconfig.xml contains more than one value for config path:
  XXXXX" or "Found Z configuration sections when at most 1 is allowed matching
  expression: XXXXX" check your solrconfig.xml file for multiple occurrences of
  XXXXX and delete the ones that you do not wish to use.  See SOLR-4953 &
  SOLR-5108 for more details.

* In the past, schema.xml parsing would silently ignore "default" or "required"
  options specified on <dynamicField/> declarations.  Beginning with 4.5, attempting
  to do configured these on a dynamic field will cause an init error.  If you
  encounter one of these errors when upgrading an existing schema.xml, you can
  safely remove these attributes, regardless of their value, from your config and
  Solr will continue to behave exactly as it did in previous versions.  See
  SOLR-5227 for more details.

* The UniqFieldsUpdateProcessorFactory has been improved to support all of the
  FieldMutatingUpdateProcessorFactory selector options.  The <lst named="fields">
  init param option is now deprecated and should be replaced with the more standard
  <arr name="fieldName">.  See SOLR-4249 for more details.

* UpdateRequestExt has been removed as part of SOLR-4816. You should use UpdateRequest
  instead.

* CloudSolrServer can now use multiple threads to add documents by default. This is a
  small change in runtime semantics when using the bulk add method - you will still
  end up with the same exception on a failure, but some documents beyond the one that
  failed may have made it in. To get the old, single threaded behavior, set parallel updates
  to false on the CloudSolrServer instance.

Detailed Change List
----------------------

New Features
----------------------

* SOLR-5219: Rewritten selection of the default search and document clustering
  algorithms. (Dawid Weiss)

* SOLR-5202: Support easier overrides of Carrot2 clustering attributes via
  XML data sets exported from the Workbench. (Dawid Weiss)

* SOLR-5126: Update Carrot2 clustering to version 3.8.0, update Morfologik
  to version 1.7.1 (Dawid Weiss)

* SOLR-2345: Enhanced geodist() to work with an RPT field, provided that the
  field is referenced via 'sfield' and the query point is constant.
  (David Smiley)

* SOLR-5082: The encoding of URL-encoded query parameters can be changed with
  the "ie" (input encoding) parameter, e.g. "select?q=m%FCller&ie=ISO-8859-1".
  The default is UTF-8. To change the encoding of POSTed content, use the
  "Content-Type" HTTP header.  (Uwe Schindler, Shawn Heisey)

* SOLR-4221: Custom sharding (Noble Paul)

* SOLR-4808: Persist and use router,replicationFactor and maxShardsPerNode at Collection

* SOLR-5156: Enhance ZkCLI to allow uploading of arbitrary files to ZK. (Erick Erickson)

* SOLR-5165: Single-valued docValues fields no longer require a default value.
  Additionally they work with sortMissingFirst, sortMissingLast, facet.missing,
  exists() in function queries, etc.  (Robert Muir)

* SOLR-5182: Add NoOpRegenerator, a regenerator for custom per-segment caches
  where items are preserved across commits.  (Robert Muir)

* SOLR-4249: UniqFieldsUpdateProcessorFactory now extends
  FieldMutatingUpdateProcessorFactory and supports all of its selector options. Use
  of the "fields" init param is now deprecated in favor of "fieldName" (hossman)

* SOLR-2548: Allow multiple threads to be specified for faceting. When threading, one
  can specify facet.threads to parallelize loading the uninverted fields. In at least
  one extreme case this reduced warmup time from 20 seconds to 3 seconds. (Janne Majaranta,
  Gun Akkor via Erick Erickson, David Smiley)

* SOLR-4816: CloudSolrServer can now route updates locally and no longer relies on inter-node
  update forwarding.  (Joel Bernstein, Shikhar Bhushan, Stephen Riesenberg, Mark Miller)

* SOLR-3249: Allow CloudSolrServer and SolrCmdDistributor to use JavaBin. (Mark Miller)

Bug Fixes
----------------------

 (Patrick Hunt via Erick Erickson)

* SOLR-5107: Fixed NPE when using numTerms=0 in LukeRequestHandler
  (Ahmet Arslan, hossman)

* SOLR-4679, SOLR-4908, SOLR-5124: Text extracted from HTML or PDF files
  using Solr Cell was missing ignorable whitespace, which is inserted by
  TIKA for convenience to support plain text extraction without using the
  HTML elements. This bug resulted in glued words.  (hossman, Uwe Schindler)

* SOLR-5121: zkcli usage help for makepath doesn't match actual command.
  (Daniel Collins via Mark Miller)

* SOLR-5119: Managed schema problems after adding fields via Schema Rest API.
  (Nils Kübler, Steve Rowe)

* SOLR-5133: HdfsUpdateLog can fail to close a FileSystem instance if init
  is called more than once. (Mark Miller)

* SOLR-5135: Harden Collection API deletion of /collections/$collection
  ZooKeeper node. (Mark Miller)

* SOLR-4764: When using NRT, just init the first reader from IndexWriter.
  (Robert Muir, Mark Miller)

* SOLR-5122: Fixed bug in spellcheck.collateMaxCollectDocs.  Eliminates risk
  of divide by zero, and makes estimated hit counts meaningful in non-optimized
  indexes.  (hossman)

* SOLR-3936: Fixed QueryElevationComponent sorting when used with Grouping
  (Michael Garski via hossman)

* SOLR-5171: SOLR Admin gui works in IE9, breaks in IE10. (Joseph L Howard via

  work even if ZK contains nodes with data which are not utf8 text. (hossman)

* SOLR-5206: Fixed OpenExchangeRatesOrgProvider to use refreshInterval correctly
  (Catalin, hossman)

* SOLR-5215: Fix possibility of deadlock in ZooKeeper ConnectionManager.
  (Mark Miller, Ricardo Merizalde)

* SOLR-4909: Use DirectoryReader.openIfChanged in non-NRT mode.
  (Michael Garski via Robert Muir)

* SOLR-5227: Correctly fail schema initialization if a dynamicField is configured to
  be required, or have a default value.  (hossman)

* SOLR-5231: Fixed a bug with the behavior of BoolField that caused documents w/o
  a value for the field to act as if the value were true in functions if no other
  documents in the same index segment had a value of true.
  (Robert Muir, hossman, yonik)

* SOLR-5233: The "deleteshard" collections API doesn't wait for cluster state to update,
  can fail if some nodes of the deleted shard were down and had incorrect logging.
  (Christine Poerschke, shalin)

* SOLR-5150: HdfsIndexInput may not fully read requested bytes. (Mark Miller, Patrick Hunt)

* SOLR-5240: All solr cores will now be loaded in parallel (as opposed to a fixed number)
  in zookeeper mode to avoid deadlocks due to replicas waiting for other replicas
  to come up. (yonik)

* SOLR-5243: Killing a shard in one collection can result in leader election in a different
  collection if they share the same coreNodeName. (yonik, Mark Miller)

* SOLR-5281: IndexSchema log message was printing '[null]' instead of
  '[<core name>]' (Jun Ohtani via Steve Rowe)

* SOLR-5279: Implicit properties don't seem to exist on core RELOAD
  (elyograg, hossman, Steve Rowe)

* SOLR-5291: Solrj does not propagate the root cause to the user for many errors.
  (Mark Miller)

  core (steffkes)

* SOLR-5134: Have HdfsIndexOutput extend BufferedIndexOutput.
  (Mark Miller, Uwe Schindler)

* SOLR-4816: CloudSolrServer now uses multiple threads to send updates by default.
  (Joel Bernstein via Mark Miller)

* SOLR-3530: Better error messages / Content-Type validation in SolrJ. (Mark Miller, hossman)

Other Changes

* SOLR-4708: Enable ClusteringComponent by default in collection1 example.
  The solr.clustering.enabled system property is set to 'true' by default.
  (ehatcher, Dawid Weiss)

* SOLR-4914, SOLR-5162: Factor out core list persistence and discovery into a
  new CoresLocator interface. (Alan Woodward, Shawn Heisey)

* SOLR-5056: Improve type safety of ConfigSolr class. (Alan Woodward)

* SOLR-4951: Better randomization of MergePolicy in Solr tests (hossman)

  The old parameter should continue to work for another release  (Noble Paul)

* SOLR-5173: Solr-core's Maven configuration includes test-only Hadoop
  dependencies as indirect compile-time dependencies.
  (Chris Collins, Steve Rowe)

==================  4.4.0 ==================

Versions of Major Components
---------------------
Apache Tika 1.4
Carrot2 3.6.2
Velocity 1.7 and Velocity Tools 2.0
Apache UIMA 2.3.1
Apache ZooKeeper 3.4.5

Upgrading from Solr 4.3.0
----------------------

* TieredMergePolicy and the various subtypes of LogMergePolicy no longer have
  an explicit "setUseCompoundFile" method.  Instead the behavior of new
  segments is determined by the IndexWriter configuration, and the MergePolicy
  is only consulted to determine if merge segments should use the compound
  file format (based on the value of "setNoCFSRatio").  If you have explicitly
  configured one of these classes using <mergePolicy> and include an init arg
  like this...
     <bool name="useCompoundFile">true</bool>
  ...this will now be treated as if you specified...
     <useCompoundFile>true</useCompoundFile>
  ...directly on the <indexConfig> (overriding any value already set using that
  syntax) and a warning will be logged to updated your configuration.  Users
  with an explicitly declared <mergePolicy> are encouraged to review the
  current javadocs for their MergePolicy subclass and review their configured
  options carefully.  See SOLR-4941, SOLR-4934 and LUCENE-5038 for more
  information.

* SOLR-4778: The signature of LogWatcher.registerListener has changed, from
  (ListenerConfig, CoreContainer) to (ListenerConfig).  Users implementing their
  own LogWatcher classes will need to change their code accordingly.

* LUCENE-5063: ByteField and ShortField have been deprecated and will be removed
  in 5.0. If you are still using these field types, you should migrate your
  fields to TrieIntField.


Detailed Change List
----------------------

New Features
----------------------

* SOLR-3251: Dynamically add fields to schema. (Steve Rowe, Robert Muir, yonik)

* SOLR-4761, SOLR-4976: Add option to plugin a merged segment warmer into solrconfig.xml.
  Info about segments warmed in the background is available via infostream.
  (Mark Miller, Ryan Ernst, Mike McCandless, Robert Muir)

* SOLR-3240: Add "spellcheck.collateMaxCollectDocs" option so that when testing
  potential Collations against the index, SpellCheckComponent will only collect
  n documents, thereby estimating the hit-count.  This is a performance optimization
  in cases where exact hit-counts are unnecessary.  Also, when "collateExtendedResults"
  is false, this optimization is always made (James Dyer).

* SOLR-4785: New MaxScoreQParserPlugin returning max() instead of sum() of terms (janhoy)

* SOLR-4234: Add support for binary files in ZooKeeper. (Eric Pugh via Mark Miller)

* SOLR-4048: Add findRecursive method to NamedList. (Shawn Heisey)

* SOLR-4228: SolrJ's SolrPing object has new methods for ping, enable, and
  disable. (Shawn Heisey, hossman, Steve Rowe)

* SOLR-4893: Extend FieldMutatingUpdateProcessor.ConfigurableFieldNameSelector
  to enable checking whether a field matches any schema field.  To select field
  names that don't match any fields or dynamic fields in the schema, add
  <bool name="fieldNameMatchesSchemaField">false</bool> to an update
  processor's configuration in solrconfig.xml.  (Steve Rowe, hossman)

* SOLR-4921: Admin UI now supports adding documents to Solr (gsingers, steffkes)

* SOLR-4916: Add support to write and read Solr index files and transaction log
  files to and from HDFS. (phunt, Mark Miller, Gregory Chanan)

* SOLR-4892: Add FieldMutatingUpdateProcessorFactory subclasses
  Parse{Date,Integer,Long,Float,Double,Boolean}UpdateProcessorFactory. These
  factories have a default selector that matches all fields that either don’t
  match any schema field, or are in the schema with the corresponding
  typeClass. If they see a value that is not a CharSequence, or can't parse
  the value, they leave it as is. For multi-valued fields, these processors
  will not convert any values unless all are first successfully parsed, or
  already are instances of the target class. Ordering the processors, e.g.
  [Boolean, Long, Double, Date] will allow e.g. values ["2", "5", "8.6"] to
  be left alone by the Boolean and Long processors, but then converted by the
  Double processor.  (Steve Rowe, hossman)

* SOLR-4972: Add PUT command to ZkCli tool. (Roman Shaposhnik via Mark Miller)

* SOLR-4973: Adding getter method for defaultCollection on CloudSolrServer.
  (Furkan KAMACI via Mark Miller)

* SOLR-4897: Add solr/example/example-schemaless/, an example config set
  for schemaless mode. (Steve Rowe)

* SOLR-4655: Add option to have Overseer assign generic node names so that
  new addresses can host shards without naming confusion. (Mark Miller, Anshum Gupta)

* SOLR-4977: Add option to send IndexWriter's infostream to the logging system.
  (Ryan Ernst via Robert Muir)

* SOLR-4693: A "deleteshard" collections API that unloads all replicas of a given
  shard and then removes it from the cluster state. It will remove only those shards
  which are INACTIVE or have no range (created for custom sharding).
  (Anshum Gupta, shalin)

* SOLR-5003: CSV Update Handler supports optionally adding the line number/row id to
  a document (gsingers)

* SOLR-5010: Add support for creating copy fields to the Schema REST API (gsingers)

* SOLR-4991: Register QParserPlugins as SolrInfoMBeans (ehatcher)

* SOLR-4943: Add a new system wide info admin handler that exposes the system info
  that could previously only be retrieved using a SolrCore. (Mark Miller)

* SOLR-3076: Block joins.  Documents and their sub-documents must be indexed
  as a block.
  {!parent which=<allParents>}<someChildren>  takes in a query that matches child
     documents and results in matches on their parents.
  {!child of=<allParents>}<someParents>  takes in a query that matches some parent
     documents and results in matches on their children.
  (Mikhail Khludnev, Vadim Kirilchuk, Alan Woodward, Tom Burton-West, Mike McCandless,
  hossman, yonik)


Bug Fixes
----------------------

* SOLR-4333: edismax parser to not double-escape colons if already escaped by
  the client application (James Dyer, Robert J. van der Boon)

* SOLR-4776: Solrj doesn't return "between" count in range facets
  (Philip K. Warren via shalin)

* SOLR-4616: HitRatio on caches is now exposed over JMX MBeans as a float.
  (Greg Bowyer)

* SOLR-4803: Fixed core discovery mode (ie: new style solr.xml) to treat
  'collection1' as the default core name. (hossman)

* SOLR-4790: Throw an error if a core has the same name as another core, both old and
  new style solr.xml

* SOLR-4842: Fix facet.field local params from affecting other facet.field's.
  (ehatcher, hossman)

* SOLR-4814: If a SolrCore cannot be created it should remove any information it
  published about itself from ZooKeeper. (Mark Miller)

* SOLR-4863: Removed non-existent attribute sourceId from dynamic JMX stats
  to fix AttributeNotFoundException (suganuma, hossman via shalin)

* SOLR-4891: JsonLoader should preserve field value types from the JSON content stream.
  (Steve Rowe)

* SOLR-4805: SolrCore#reload should not call preRegister and publish a DOWN state to
  ZooKeeper. (Mark Miller, Jared Rodriguez)

* SOLR-4899: When reconnecting after ZooKeeper expiration, we need to be willing to wait
  forever, not just for 30 seconds. (Mark Miller)

* SOLR-4920: JdbcDataSource incorrectly suppresses exceptions when retrieving a connection from
  a JNDI context and falls back to trying to use DriverManager to obtain a connection. Additionally,
  if a SQLException is thrown while initializing a connection, such as in setAutoCommit(), the
  connection will not be closed. (Chris Eldredge via shalin)

* SOLR-4915: The root cause should be returned to the user when a SolrCore create call fails.
  (Mark Miller)

* SOLR-4925 : Collection create throws NPE when 'numShards' param is missing (Noble Paul)

* SOLR-4910: persisting solr.xml is broken. More stringent testing of persistence fixed
  up a number of issues and several bugs with persistence. Among them are
  - don't persisting implicit properties
  - should persist zkHost in the <solr> tag (user's list)
  - reloading a core that has transient="true" returned an error. reload should load
    a transient core if it's not yet loaded.
  - No longer persisting loadOnStartup or transient core properties if they were not
    specified in the original solr.xml
  - Testing flushed out the fact that you couldn't swap a core marked transient=true
    loadOnStartup=false because it hadn't been loaded yet.
  - SOLR-4862, CREATE fails to persist schema, config, and dataDir
  - SOLR-4363, not persisting coreLoadThreads in <solr> tag
  - SOLR-3900, logWatcher properties not persisted
  - SOLR-4850, cores defined as loadOnStartup=true, transient=false can't be searched
  (Erick Erickson)

* SOLR-4923: Commits to non leaders as part of a request that also contain updates
  can execute out of order. (hossman, Ricardo Merizalde, Mark Miller)

* SOLR-4932: persisting solr.xml saves some parameters it shouldn't when they weren't
  defined in the original. Benign since the default values are saved, but still incorrect.
  (Erick Erickson, thanks Shawn Heisey for helping test!)

* SOLR-4934, SOLR-4941: Fix handling of <mergePolicy> init arg
  "useCompoundFile" needed after changes in LUCENE-5038 (hossman)

* SOLR-4456: Admin UI: Displays dashboard even if Solr is down (steffkes)

* SOLR-4949: UI Analysis page dropping characters from input box (steffkes)

* SOLR-4960: Fix race conditions in shutdown of CoreContainer
  and getCore that could cause a request to attempt to use a core that
  has shut down. (yonik)

* SOLR-4926: Fixed rare replication bug that normally only manifested when
  using compound file format. (yonik, Mark Miller)

* SOLR-4974: Outgrowth of SOLR-4960 that includes transient cores and pending cores
  (Erick Erickson)

* SOLR-3369: shards.tolerant=true is broken for group queries
  (Russell Black, Martijn van Groningen, Jabouille jean Charles, Ryan McKinley via shalin)

* SOLR-4452: Hunspell stemmer should not merge duplicate dictionary entries (janhoy)

* SOLR-5000: ManagedIndexSchema doesn't persist uniqueKey tag after calling addFields
  method. (Jun Ohtani, Steve Rowe)

* SOLR-4982: Creating a core while referencing system properties looks like it loses files
  Actually, instanceDir, config, dataDir and schema are not dereferenced properly
  when creating cores that reference sys vars (e.g. &dataDir=${dir}). In the dataDir
  case in particular this leads to the index being put in a directory literally named
  ${dir} but on restart the sysvar will be properly dereferenced.

* SOLR-4788: Multiple Entities DIH delta import: dataimporter.[entityName].last_index_time
  is empty. (chakming wong, James Dyer via shalin)

* SOLR-4978: Time is stripped from datetime column when imported into Solr date field
  if convertType=true. (Bill Au, shalin)

Bug Fixes
----------------------

* SOLR-4795: Sub shard leader should not accept any updates from parent after
  it goes active (shalin)

* SOLR-4798: shard splitting does not respect the router for the collection
  when executing the index split.   One effect of this is that documents
  may be placed in the wrong shard when the default compositeId router
  is used in conjunction with IDs containing "!". (yonik)

* SOLR-4797: Shard splitting creates sub shards which have the wrong hash
  range in cluster state. This happens when numShards is not a power of two
  and router is compositeId. (shalin)

* SOLR-4806: Shard splitting does not abort if WaitForState times out (shalin)

* SOLR-4807: The zkcli script now works with log4j. The zkcli.bat script
  was broken on Windows in 4.3.0, now it works. (Shawn Heisey)

* SOLR-4813: Fix SynonymFilterFactory to allow init parameters for
  tokenizer factory used when parsing synonyms file.  (Shingo Sasaki, hossman)

* SOLR-4829: Fix transaction log leaks (a failure to clean up some old logs)
  on a shard leader, or when unexpected exceptions are thrown during log
  recovery.  (Steven Bower, Mark Miller, yonik)

* SOLR-4751: Fix replication problem of files in sub directory of conf directory.
  (Minoru Osuka via Koji)

* SOLR-4741: Deleting a collection should set DELETE_DATA_DIR to true.
  (Mark Miller)

* SOLR-4752: There are some minor bugs in the Collections API parameter
  validation. (Mark Miller)

* SOLR-4563: RSS DIH-example not working (janhoy)

* SOLR-4796: zkcli.sh should honor JAVA_HOME (Roman Shaposhnik via Mark Miller)

* SOLR-4734: Leader election fails with an NPE if there is no UpdateLog.
 (Mark Miller, Alexander Eibner)

* SOLR-4868: Setting the log level for the log4j root category results in
  adding a new category, the empty string. (Shawn Heisey)

  case for handling TermQuery to prevent NullPointerException if reader does
  not have fields.  (Bao Yang Yang, Uwe Schindler)

* SOLR-4881: Fix DocumentAnalysisRequestHandler to correctly use
  EmptyEntityResolver to prevent loading of external entities like
  UpdateRequestHandler does.  (Hossman, Uwe Schindler)

* SOLR-4858: SolrCore reloading was broken when the UpdateLog
  was enabled.  (Hossman, Anshum Gupta, Alexey Serba, Mark Miller, yonik)

* SOLR-4853: Fixed SolrJettyTestBase so it may be reused by end users
  (hossman)

* SOLR-4744: Update failure on sub shard is not propagated to clients by parent
  shard (Anshum Gupta, yonik, shalin)

Other Changes
----------------------

* SOLR-4760: Include core name in logs when loading schema.
  (Shawn Heisey)

==================  4.3.0 ==================

Versions of Major Components
---------------------
Apache Tika 1.3
Carrot2 3.6.2
Velocity 1.7 and Velocity Tools 2.0
Apache UIMA 2.3.1
Apache ZooKeeper 3.4.5

Upgrading from Solr 4.2.0
----------------------

* In the schema REST API, the output path for copyFields and dynamicFields
  has been changed from all lowercase "copyfields" and "dynamicfields" to
  camelCase "copyFields" and "dynamicFields", respectively, to align with all
  other schema REST API outputs, which use camelCase.  The URL format remains
  the same: all resource names are lowercase.  See SOLR-4623 for details.

* Slf4j/logging jars are no longer included in the Solr webapp. All logging
  jars are now in example/lib/ext. Changing logging impls is now as easy as
  updating the jars in this folder with those necessary for the logging impl
  you would like. If you are using another webapp container, these jars will
  need to go in the corresponding location for that container.
  In conjunction, the dist-excl-slf4j and dist-war-excl-slf4 build targets
  have been removed since they are redundant.  See the Slf4j documentation,
  SOLR-3706, and SOLR-4651 for more details.

* The hardcoded SolrCloud defaults for 'hostContext="solr"' and
  'hostPort="8983"' have been deprecated and will be removed in Solr 5.0.
  Existing solr.xml files that do not have these options explicitly specified
  should be updated accordingly.  See SOLR-4622 for more details.


Detailed Change List
----------------------

New Features
----------------------

* SOLR-4648 PreAnalyzedUpdateProcessorFactory allows using the functionality
  of PreAnalyzedField with other field types. See javadoc for details and
  examples. (Andrzej Bialecki)

* SOLR-4623: Provide REST API read access to all elements of the live schema.
  Add a REST API request to return the entire live schema, in JSON, XML, and
  schema.xml formats.  Move REST API methods from package org.apache.solr.rest
  to org.apache.solr.rest.schema, and rename base functionality REST API
  classes to remove the current schema focus, to prepare for other non-schema
  REST APIs.  Change output path for copyFields and dynamicFields from
  "copyfields" and "dynamicfields" (all lowercase) to "copyFields" and
  "dynamicFields", respectively, to align with all other REST API outputs, which
  use camelCase.
  (Steve Rowe)

* SOLR-4658: In preparation for REST API requests that can modify the schema,
  a "managed schema" is introduced.
  Add '<schemaFactory class="ManagedSchemaFactory" mutable="true"/>' to solrconfig.xml
  in order to use it, and to enable schema modifications via REST API requests.
  (Steve Rowe, Robert Muir)

* SOLR-4656: Added two new highlight parameters, hl.maxMultiValuedToMatch and
  hl.maxMultiValuedToExamine. maxMultiValuedToMatch stops looking for snippets after
  finding the specified number of matches, no matter how far into the multivalued field
  you've gone. maxMultiValuedToExamine stops looking for matches after the specified
  number of multiValued entries have been examined. If both are specified, the limit
  hit first stops the loop. Also this patch cuts down on the copying of the document
  entries during highlighting. These optimizations are probably unnoticeable unless
  there are a large number of entries in the multiValued field. Conspicuously, this will
  prevent the "best" match from being found if it appears later in the MV list than the
  cutoff specified by either of these params. (Erick Erickson)

* SOLR-4675: Improve PostingsSolrHighlighter to support per-field/query-time overrides
  and add additional configuration parameters. See the javadocs for more details and
  examples. (Robert Muir)

* SOLR-3755: A new collections api to add additional shards dynamically by splitting
  existing shards. (yonik, Anshum Gupta, shalin)

* SOLR-4530: DIH: Provide configuration to use Tika's IdentityHtmlMapper
  (Alexandre Rafalovitch via shalin)

* SOLR-4662: Discover SolrCores by directory structure rather than defining them
  in solr.xml. Also, change the format of solr.xml to be closer to that of solrconfig.xml.
  This version of Solr will ship the example in the old style, but you can manually
  try the new style. Solr 4.4 will ship with the new style, and Solr 5.0 will remove
  support for the old style. (Erick Erickson, Mark Miller)
  Additional Work:
  - SOLR-4347: Ensure that newly-created cores via Admin handler are persisted in solr.xml
    (Erick Erickson)
  - SOLR-1905: Cores created by the admin request handler should be persisted to solr.xml.
    Also fixed a problem whereby properties like solr.solr.datadir would be persisted
    to solr.xml. Also, cores that didn't happen to be loaded were not persisted.
    (Erick Erickson)

* SOLR-4717/SOLR-1351: SimpleFacets now work with localParams allowing faceting on the
  same field multiple ways (ryan, Uri Boness)

* SOLR-4671: CSVResponseWriter now supports pseudo fields. (ryan, nihed mbarek)

  explicit or dynamic fields.  This regression was introduced in Solr 4.2.
  (Daniel Collins, Steve Rowe)

* SOLR-4641: Schema now throws exception on illegal field parameters.  (Robert Muir)

* SOLR-3758: Fixed SpellCheckComponent to work consistently with distributed grouping
  (James Dyer)

  were sorted incorrectly. (Alexander Buhr, shalin, yonik)

* SOLR-4699: The System admin handler should not assume a file system based data directory
  location. (Mark Miller)

* SOLR-4695: Fix core admin SPLIT action to be useful with non-cloud setups (shalin)

  use "text" field instead of narrower "name" field (ehatcher, Mark Bennett)

* SOLR-4702: Fix example /browse "Did you mean?" suggestion feature. (ehatcher, Mark Bennett)

* SOLR-4710: You cannot delete a collection fully from ZooKeeper unless all nodes are up and
  functioning correctly. (Mark Miller)

* SOLR-4487: SolrExceptions thrown by HttpSolrServer will now contain the
  proper HTTP status code returned by the remote server, even if that status
  code is not something Solr itself returned -- eg: from the Servlet Container,
  or an intermediate HTTP Proxy (hossman)

* SOLR-4661: Admin UI Replication details now correctly displays the current
  replicable generation/version of the master. (hossman)

* SOLR-4716,SOLR-4584: SolrCloud request proxying does not work on Tomcat and
  perhaps other non Jetty containers. (Po Rui, Yago Riveiro via Mark Miller)

* SOLR-4746: Distributed grouping used a NamedList instead of a SimpleOrderedMap
  for the top level group commands, causing output formatting differences
  compared to non-distributed grouping. (yonik)

* SOLR-4705: Fixed bug causing NPE when querying a single replica in SolrCloud
  using the shards param (Raintung Li, hossman)

* SOLR-4729: LukeRequestHandler: Using a dynamic copyField source that is
  not also a dynamic field triggers error message 'undefined field: "(glob)"'.
  (Adam Hahn, hossman, Steve Rowe)

  'hostPort="8983"' have been deprecated and will be removed in Solr 5.0.
  Existing solr.xml files that do not have these options explicitly specified
  should be updated accordingly.  (hossman)

* SOLR-4672: Requests attempting to use SolrCores which had init failures
  (that would be reported by CoreAdmin STATUS requests) now result in 500
  error responses with the details about the init failure, instead of 404
  error responses.  (hossman)

* SOLR-4730: Make the wiki link more prominent in the release documentation.
  (Uri Laserson via Robert Muir)

  if <directoryFactory> is not present in solrconfig.xml (Jack Krupansky via shalin)

* SOLR-4463: Fix SolrCoreState reference counting. (Mark Miller)

* SOLR-4459: The Replication 'index move' rather than copy optimization doesn't
  kick in when using NRTCachingDirectory or the rate limiting feature.
  (Mark Miller)

* SOLR-4421,SOLR-4165: On CoreContainer shutdown, all SolrCores should publish their
  state as DOWN. (Mark Miller, Markus Jelsma)

* SOLR-4467: Ephemeral directory implementations may not recover correctly
  because the code to clear the tlog files on startup is off. (Mark Miller)

* SOLR-4413: Fix SolrCore#getIndexDir() to return the current index directory.
  (Gregg Donovan, Mark Miller)

* SOLR-4469: A new IndexWriter must be opened on SolrCore reload when the index
  directory has changed and the previous SolrCore's state should not be
  propagated. (Mark Miller, Gregg Donovan)

* SOLR-4471: Replication occurs even when a slave is already up to date.
  (Mark Miller, Andre Charton)

* SOLR-4484: ReplicationHandler#loadReplicationProperties still uses Files
  rather than the Directory to try and read the replication properties files.
  (Mark Miller)

  set zkHost in solr.xml. (Alfonso Presa, Mark Miller)

* SOLR-4505: Possible deadlock around SolrCoreState update lock.
  (Erick Erickson, Mark Miller)

* SOLR-4511: When a new index is replicated into place, we need

  well as when nodes may switch master/slave roles.
  (Mark Miller, Raúl Grande)

* SOLR-4515: CurrencyField's OpenExchangeRatesOrgProvider now requires
  a ratesFileLocation init param, since the previous global default

  (Mark Miller, Simon Scofield)

* SOLR-4529: Improve Admin UI Dashboard legibility (Felix Buenemann via
  steffkes)

* SOLR-4526: Admin UI depends on optional system info (Felix Buenemann via
  steffkes)

Other Changes
----------------------

* SOLR-4259: Carrot2 dependency should be declared on the mini version, not the core.
  (Dawid Weiss).

* SOLR-4348: Make the lock type configurable by system property by default.
  (Mark Miller)

* SOLR-4353: Renamed example jetty context file to reduce confusion (hossman)

* SOLR-4384: Make post.jar report timing information (Upayavira via janhoy)

* SOLR-4415: Add 'state' to shards (default to 'active') and read/write them to
  ZooKeeper (Anshum Gupta via shalin)

* SOLR-4394: Tests and example configs demonstrating SSL with both server
  and client certs (hossman)

* SOLR-3060: SurroundQParserPlugin highlighting tests

* SOLR-4200: Reduce INFO level logging from CachingDirectoryFactory
  (Shawn Heisey via hossman)

==================  4.1.0 ==================

Versions of Major Components
---------------------
Apache Tika 1.2
Carrot2 3.6.2
Velocity 1.7 and Velocity Tools 2.0
Apache UIMA 2.3.1
Apache ZooKeeper 3.4.5

Upgrading from Solr 4.0.0
----------------------

Custom java parsing plugins need to migrate from throwing the internal
ParseException to throwing SyntaxError.

BaseDistributedSearchTestCase now randomizes the servlet context it uses when
creating Jetty instances.  Subclasses that assume a hard coded context of
"/solr" should either be fixed to use the "String context" variable, or should
take advantage of the new BaseDistributedSearchTestCase(String) constructor
to explicitly specify a fixed servlet context path.  See SOLR-4136 for details.


Detailed Change List
----------------------

New Features
----------------------

* SOLR-2255: Enhanced pivot faceting to use local-params in the same way that
  regular field value faceting can. This means support for excluding a filter
  query, using a different output key, and specifying 'threads' to do
  facet.method=fcs concurrently. PivotFacetHelper now extends SimpleFacet and
  the getFacetImplementation() extension hook was removed. (dsmiley)

* SOLR-3897: A highlighter parameter "hl.preserveMulti" to return all of the
  values of a multiValued field in their original order when highlighting.
  (Joel Bernstein via yonik)

* SOLR-3929: Support configuring IndexWriter max thread count in solrconfig.
  (phunt via Mark Miller)

* SOLR-3906: Add support for AnalyzingSuggester (LUCENE-3842), where the
  underlying analyzed form used for suggestions is separate from the returned
  text.  (Robert Muir)

* SOLR-3985: ExternalFileField caches can be reloaded on firstSearcher/
  newSearcher events using the ExternalFileFieldReloader (Alan Woodward)

* SOLR-3911: Make Directory and DirectoryFactory first class so that the majority
  of Solr's features work with any custom implementations. (Mark Miller)
  Additional Work:
  - SOLR-4032: Files larger than an internal buffer size fail to replicate.
    (Mark Miller, Markus Jelsma)
  - SOLR-4033: Consistently use the solrconfig.xml lockType everywhere.
    (Mark Miller, Markus Jelsma)
  - SOLR-4144: Replication using too much RAM. (yonik, Markus Jelsma)
  - SOLR-4187: NPE on Directory release (Mark Miller, Markus Jelsma)

* SOLR-4051: Add <propertyWriter /> element to DIH's data-config.xml file,
  allowing the user to specify the location, filename and Locale for
  the "data-config.properties" file.  Alternatively, users can specify their
  own property writer implementation for greater control. This new configuration
  element is optional, and defaults mimic prior behavior.  The one exception is
  that the "root" locale is default. Previously it was the machine's default locale.
  (James Dyer)

* SOLR-4084: Add FuzzyLookupFactory, which is like AnalyzingSuggester except that
  it can tolerate typos in the input.  (Areek Zillur via Robert Muir)

* SOLR-4088: New and improved auto host detection strategy for SolrCloud.
  (Raintung Li via Mark Miller)

* SOLR-3970: SystemInfoHandler now exposes more details about the
  JRE/VM/Java version in use.  (hossman)

* SOLR-4101: Add support for storing term offsets in the index via a
  'storeOffsetsWithPositions' flag on field definitions in the schema.
  (Tom Winch, Alan Woodward)

* SOLR-4093: Solr QParsers may now be directly invoked in the lucene
  query syntax without the _query_ magic field hack.
  Example:  foo AND {!term f=myfield v=$qq}
  (yonik)

* SOLR-4087: Add MAX_DOC_FREQ option to MoreLikeThis.
  (Andrew Janowczyk via Mark Miller)

* SOLR-4114: Allow creating more than one shard per instance with the
  Collection API. (Per Steffensen, Mark Miller)

* SOLR-3531: Allowing configuring maxMergeSizeMB and maxCachedMB when
  using NRTCachingDirectoryFactory. (Andy Laird via Mark Miller)

* SOLR-4118: Fix replicationFactor to align with industry usage.
  replicationFactor now means the total number of copies
  of a document stored in the collection (or the total number of
  physical indexes for a single logical slice of the collection).
  For example if replicationFactor=3 then for a given shard there
  will be a total of 3 replicas (one of which will normally be
  designated as the leader.) (yonik)

* SOLR-4124: You should be able to set the update log directory with the
  CoreAdmin API the same way as the data directory. (Mark Miller)

* SOLR-4028: When using ZK chroot, it would be nice if Solr would create the
  initial path when it doesn't exist. (Tomás Fernández Löbbe via Mark Miller)

* SOLR-3948: Calculate/display deleted documents in admin interface.
  (Shawn Heisey via Mark Miller)

* SOLR-4030: Allow rate limiting Directory IO based on the IO context.
  (Mark Miller, Radim Kolar)

* SOLR-4166: LBHttpSolrServer ignores ResponseParser passed in constructor.
  (Steve Molloy via Mark Miller)

* SOLR-4140: Allow access to the collections API through CloudSolrServer
  without referencing an existing collection. (Per Steffensen via Mark Miller)

* SOLR-788: Distributed search support for MLT.
  (Matthew Woytowitz, Mike Anderson, Jamie Johnson, Mark Miller)

* SOLR-4120: Collection API: Support for specifying a list of Solr addresses to
  spread a new collection across. (Per Steffensen via Mark Miller)

* SOLR-4110: Configurable Content-Type headers for PHPResponseWriters and
  PHPSerializedResponseWriter. (Dominik Siebel via Mark Miller)

* SOLR-1028: The ability to specify "transient" and "loadOnStartup" as a new properties of
  <core> tags in solr.xml. Can specify "transientCacheSize" in the <cores> tag. Together
  these allow cores to be loaded only when needed and only transientCacheSize transient
  cores will be loaded at a time, the rest aged out on an LRU basis.

* SOLR-4246: When update.distrib is set to skip update processors before
  the distributed update processor, always include the log update processor
  so forwarded updates will still be logged. (yonik)

* SOLR-4230: The new Solr 4 spatial fields now work with the {!geofilt} and
  {!bbox} query parsers. The score local-param works too. (David Smiley)

* SOLR-1972: Add extra statistics to RequestHandlers - 5 & 15-minute reqs/sec
  rolling averages; median, 75th, 95th, 99th, 99.9th percentile request times
  (Alan Woodward, Shawn Heisey, Adrien Grand, Uwe Schindler)

* SOLR-4271: Add support for PostingsHighlighter.  (Robert Muir)

* SOLR-4255: The new Solr 4 spatial fields now have a 'filter' boolean local-param
  that can be set to false to not filter. It's useful when there is already a spatial
  filter query but you also need to sort or boost by distance. (David Smiley)

* SOLR-4265, SOLR-4283: Solr now parses request parameters (in URL or sent with POST
  using content-type application/x-www-form-urlencoded) in its dispatcher code. It no
  longer relies on special configuration settings in Tomcat or other web containers
  to enable UTF-8 encoding, which is mandatory for correct Solr behaviour. Query
  strings passed in via the URL need to be properly-%-escaped, UTF-8 encoded
  bytes, otherwise Solr refuses to handle the request. The maximum length of
  x-www-form-urlencoded POST parameters can now be configured through the
  requestDispatcher/requestParsers/@formdataUploadLimitInKB setting in
  solrconfig.xml (defaults to 2 MiB). Solr now works out of the box with
  e.g. Tomcat, JBoss,...  (Uwe Schindler, Dawid Weiss, Alex Rocher)

* SOLR-2201: DIH's "formatDate" function now supports a timezone as an optional
  fourth parameter (James Dyer, Mark Waddle)

* SOLR-4302: New parameter 'indexInfo' (defaults to true) in CoreAdmin STATUS
  command can be used to omit index specific information (Shahar Davidson via shalin)

* SOLR-2592: Collection specific document routing.  The "compositeId"
  router is the default for collections with hash based routing (i.e. when
  numShards=N is specified on collection creation).  Documents with ids sharing
  the same domain (prefix) will be routed to the same shard, allowing for
  efficient querying.

  Example:
    The following two documents will be indexed to the same shard
    since they share the same domain "customerB!".
    <code>
       {"id" : "customerB!doc1" [...] }
       {"id" : "customerB!doc2" [...] }
    </code>
    At query time, one can specify a "shard.keys" parameter that lists what
    shards the query should cover.
       http://.../query?q=my_query&shard.keys=customerB!

  Collections that do not specify numShards at collection creation time
  use custom sharding and default to the "implicit" router.  Document updates
  received by a shard will be indexed to that shard, unless a "_shard_" parameter
  or document field names a different shard.
  (Michael Garski, Dan Rosher, yonik)

* SOLR-4019: Log stack traces for 503/Service Unavailable SolrException if not
  thrown by PingRequestHandler. Do not log exceptions if a user tries to view a

* SOLR-3589: Edismax parser does not honor mm parameter if analyzer splits a token.
  (Tom Burton-West, Robert Muir)

* SOLR-4031: Upgrade to Jetty 8.1.7 to fix a bug where in very rare occasions
  the content of two concurrent requests get mixed up. (Per Steffensen, yonik)

* SOLR-4060: ReplicationHandler can try and do a snappull and open a new IndexWriter
  after shutdown has already occurred, leaving an IndexWriter that is not closed.

  cause actions to be targeted at the wrong SolrCores.
  (Raintung Li, Per Steffensen via Mark Miller)

* SOLR-3993: If multiple SolrCore's for a shard coexist on a node, on cluster
  restart, leader election would stall until timeout, waiting to see all of
  the replicas come up. (Mark Miller, Alexey Kudinov)

  that start with /zookeeper, as this can fail and stop the removal of
  further nodes. (Mark Miller)

* SOLR-4076: SolrQueryParser should run fuzzy terms through
  MultiTermAwareComponents to ensure that (for example) a fuzzy query of
  foobar~2 is equivalent to FooBar~2 on a field that includes lowercasing.
  (yonik)

* SOLR-4081: QueryParsing.toString, used during debugQuery=true, did not
  correctly handle ExtendedQueries such as WrappedQuery
  (used when cache=false), spatial queries, and frange queries.
  (Eirik Lygre, yonik)

* SOLR-3959: Ensure the internal comma separator of poly fields is escaped

  index directory rather than the current one. (Mark Miller, Marcin Rzewucki)

* SOLR-3876: Solr Admin UI is completely dysfunctional on IE 9 (steffkes)

* SOLR-4112: Fixed DataImportHandler ZKAwarePropertiesWriter implementation so
  import works fine with SolrCloud clusters (Deniz Durmus, James Dyer,
  Erick Erickson, shalin)

* SOLR-4291: Harden the Overseer work queue thread loop. (Mark Miller)

* SOLR-3820: Solr Admin Query form is missing some edismax request parameters
  (steffkes)

* SOLR-4217: post.jar no longer ignores -Dparams when -Durl is used.
  (Alexandre Rafalovitch, ehatcher)

  (Mark Miller, hossman)

* SOLR-3966: Eliminate superfluous warning from LanguageIdentifierUpdateProcessor
  (Markus Jelsma via hossman)

  (Mark Miller)

==================  4.0.0 ==================

Versions of Major Components
---------------------
Apache Tika 1.2
Carrot2 3.5.0
Velocity 1.6.4 and Velocity Tools 2.0
Apache UIMA 2.3.1
Apache ZooKeeper 3.3.6

Upgrading from Solr 4.0.0-BETA
----------------------

In order to better support distributed search mode, the TermVectorComponent's
response format has been changed so that if the schema defines a
uniqueKeyField, then that field value is used as the "key" for each document in
its response section, instead of the internal lucene doc id.  Users w/o a
uniqueKeyField will continue to see the same response format.  See SOLR-3229
for more details.

If you are using SolrCloud's distributed update request capabilities and a non
string type id field, you must re-index.

Upgrading from Solr 4.0.0-ALPHA
----------------------

Solr is now much more strict about requiring that the uniqueKeyField feature
(if used) must refer to a field which is not multiValued.  If you upgrade from
an earlier version of Solr and see an error that your uniqueKeyField "can not
be configured to be multivalued" please add 'multiValued="false"' to the
<field /> declaration for your uniqueKeyField.  See SOLR-3682 for more details.

In addition, please review the notes above about upgrading from 4.0.0-BETA

Upgrading from Solr 3.6
----------------------

* The Lucene index format has changed and as a result, once you upgrade,
  previous versions of Solr will no longer be able to read your indices.
  In a master/slave configuration, all searchers/slaves should be upgraded
  before the master.  If the master were to be updated first, the older
  searchers would not be able to read the new index format.

* Setting abortOnConfigurationError=false is no longer supported
  (since it has never worked properly).  Solr will now warn you if
  you attempt to set this configuration option at all. (see SOLR-1846)

* The default logic for the 'mm' param of the 'dismax' QParser has
  been changed.  If no 'mm' param is specified (either in the query,
  or as a default in solrconfig.xml) then the effective value of the
  'q.op' param (either in the query or as a default in solrconfig.xml
  or from the 'defaultOperator' option in schema.xml) is used to
  influence the behavior.  If q.op is effectively "AND" then mm=100%.
  If q.op is effectively "OR" then mm=0%.  Users who wish to force the
  legacy behavior should set a default value for the 'mm' param in
  their solrconfig.xml file.

* The VelocityResponseWriter is no longer built into the core.  Its JAR and
  dependencies now need to be added (via <lib> or solr/home lib inclusion),
  and it needs to be registered in solrconfig.xml like this:
    <queryResponseWriter name="velocity" class="solr.VelocityResponseWriter"/>

* The update request parameter to choose Update Request Processor Chain is
  renamed from "update.processor" to "update.chain". The old parameter was
  deprecated but still working since Solr3.2, but is now removed
  entirely.

* The <indexDefaults> and <mainIndex> sections of solrconfig.xml are discontinued
  and replaced with the <indexConfig> section. There are also better defaults.
  When migrating, if you don't know what your old settings mean, simply delete
  both <indexDefaults> and <mainIndex> sections. If you have customizations,
  put them in <indexConfig> section - with same syntax as before.

* Two of the SolrServer subclasses in SolrJ were renamed/replaced.
  CommonsHttpSolrServer is now HttpSolrServer, and
  StreamingUpdateSolrServer is now ConcurrentUpdateSolrServer.

* The PingRequestHandler no longer looks for a <healthcheck/> option in the
  (legacy) <admin> section of solrconfig.xml.  Users who wish to take
  advantage of this feature should configure a "healthcheckFile" init param
  directly on the  PingRequestHandler.  As part of this change, relative file
  paths have been fixed to be resolved against the data dir.  See the example
  solrconfig.xml and SOLR-1258 for more details.

* Due to low level changes to support SolrCloud, the uniqueKey field can no
  longer be populated via <copyField/> or <field default=...> in the
  schema.xml.  Users wishing to have Solr automatically generate a uniqueKey
  value when adding documents should instead use an instance of
  solr.UUIDUpdateProcessorFactory in their update processor chain.  See
  SOLR-2796 for more details.

In addition, please review the notes above about upgrading from 4.0.0-BETA, and 4.0.0-ALPHA

Detailed Change List
----------------------

New Features
----------------------

* SOLR-3670: New CountFieldValuesUpdateProcessorFactory makes it easy to index
  the number of values in another field for later use at query time. (hossman)

* SOLR-2768: new "mod(x,y)" function for computing the modulus of two value
  sources. (hossman)

* SOLR-3238: Numerous small improvements to the Admin UI (steffkes)

* SOLR-3597: seems like a lot of wasted whitespace at the top of the admin screens
  (steffkes)

* SOLR-3304: Added Solr adapters for Lucene 4's new spatial module.  With
  SpatialRecursivePrefixTreeFieldType ("location_rpt" in example schema), it is
  possible to index a variable number of points per document (and sort on them),
  index not just points but any Spatial4j supported shape such as polygons, and
  to query on these shapes too.  Polygons requires adding JTS to the classpath.
  (David Smiley)

* SOLR-3825: Added optional capability to log what ids are in a response
        (Scott Stults via gsingers)

* SOLR-3821: Added 'df' to the UI Query form (steffkes)

* SOLR-3822: Added hover titles to the edismax params on the UI Query form
  (steffkes)

Optimizations
----------------------

* SOLR-3715: improve concurrency of the transaction log by removing
  synchronization around log record serialization. (yonik)

* SOLR-3807: Currently during recovery we pause for a number of seconds after
  waiting for the leader to see a recovering state so that any previous updates
  will have finished before our commit on the leader - we don't need this wait
  for peersync. (Mark Miller)

* SOLR-3837: When a leader is elected and asks replicas to sync back to him and
  that fails, we should ask those nodes to recovery asynchronously rather than
  synchronously. (Mark Miller)

* SOLR-3709: Cache the url list created from the ClusterState in CloudSolrServer
  on each request. (Mark Miller)


Bug Fixes
----------------------

* SOLR-3685: Solr Cloud sometimes skipped peersync attempt and replicated instead due
  to tlog flags not being cleared when no updates were buffered during a previous
  replication.  (Markus Jelsma, Mark Miller, yonik)

* SOLR-3229: Fixed TermVectorComponent to work with distributed search
  (Hang Xie, hossman)

  SolrCloud tests. (rmuir, Mark Miller)

* SOLR-2981: Fixed StatsComponent to no longer return duplicated information
  when requesting multiple stats.facet fields.
  (Roman Kliewer via hossman)

* SOLR-3743: Fixed issues with atomic updates and optimistic concurrency in
  conjunction with stored copyField targets by making real-time get never
  return copyField targets. (yonik)

* SOLR-3746: Proper error reporting if updateLog is configured w/o necessary
  "_version_" field in schema.xml (hossman)

* SOLR-3745: Proper error reporting if SolrCloud mode is used w/o
  necessary "_version_" field in schema.xml (hossman)

* SOLR-3770: Overseer may lose updates to cluster state (siren)

* SOLR-3721: Fix bug that could theoretically allow multiple recoveries to run
  briefly at the same time if the recovery thread join call was interrupted.
  (Per Steffensen, Mark Miller)

* SOLR-3782: A leader going down while updates are coming in can cause shard
  inconsistency. (Mark Miller)

* SOLR-3611: We do not show ZooKeeper data in the UI for a node that has children.
  (Mark Miller)

* SOLR-3789: Fix bug in SnapPuller that caused "internal" compression to fail.
  (siren)

* SOLR-3790: ConcurrentModificationException could be thrown when using hl.fl=*.
  Fixed in r1231606. (yonik, koji)

* SOLR-3668: DataImport : Specifying Custom Parameters (steffkes)

* SOLR-3793: UnInvertedField faceting cached big terms in the filter
  cache that ignored deletions, leading to duplicate documents in search
  later when a filter of the same term was specified.
  (Günter Hipler, hossman, yonik)

* SOLR-3679: Core Admin UI gives no feedback if "Add Core" fails (steffkes, hossman)

* SOLR-3795: Fixed LukeRequestHandler response to correctly return field name
  strings in copyDests and copySources arrays (hossman)

* SOLR-3699: Fixed some Directory leaks when there were errors during SolrCore
  or SolrIndexWriter initialization. (hossman)

* SOLR-3518: Include final 'hits' in log information when aggregating a
  distributed request (Markus Jelsma via hossman)

* SOLR-3628: SolrInputField and SolrInputDocument are now consistently backed
  by Collections passed in to setValue/setField, and defensively copy values
  from Collections passed to addValue/addField
  (Tom Switzer via hossman)

* SOLR-3595: CurrencyField now generates an appropriate error on schema init
  if it is configured as multiValued - this has never been properly supported,
  but previously failed silently in odd ways.  (hossman)

* SOLR-3823: Fix 'bq' parsing in edismax.  Please note that this required
  reverting the negative boost support added by SOLR-3278 (hossman)

* SOLR-3827: Fix shareSchema=true in solr.xml
  (Tomás Fernández Löbbe via hossman)

* SOLR-3809: Fixed config file replication when subdirectories are used
  (Emmanuel Espina via hossman)

* SOLR-3828: Fixed QueryElevationComponent so that using 'markExcludes' does
  not modify the result set or ranking of 'excluded' documents relative to
  not using elevation at all.  (Alexey Serba via hossman)

* SOLR-3569: Fixed debug output on distributed requests when there are no
  results found.  (David Bowen via hossman)

* SOLR-3811: Query Form using wrong values for dismax, edismax (steffkes)

* SOLR-3779: DataImportHandler's LineEntityProcessor when used in conjunction
  with FileListEntityProcessor would only process the first file.
  (Ahmet Arslan via James Dyer)

* SOLR-3791: CachedSqlEntityProcessor would throw a NullPointerException when
  a query returns a row with a NULL key.  (Steffen Moelter via James Dyer)

* SOLR-3833: When a election is started because a leader went down, the new
  leader candidate should decline if the last state they published was not
  active. (yonik, Mark Miller)

* SOLR-3836: When doing peer sync, we should only count sync attempts that
  cannot reach the given host as success when the candidate leader is
  syncing with the replicas - not when replicas are syncing to the leader.
  (Mark Miller)

* SOLR-3835: In our leader election algorithm, if on connection loss we found
  we did not create our election node, we should retry, not throw an exception.
  (Mark Miller)

* SOLR-3834: A new leader on cluster startup should also run the leader sync
  process in case there was a bad cluster shutdown. (Mark Miller)

* SOLR-3772: On cluster startup, we should wait until we see all registered
  replicas before running the leader process - or if they all do not come up,
  N amount of time. (Mark Miller)

* SOLR-3756: If we are elected the leader of a shard, but we fail to publish
  this for any reason, we should clean up and re trigger a leader election.
  (Mark Miller)

* SOLR-3812: ConnectionLoss during recovery can cause lost updates, leading to
  shard inconsistency. (Mark Miller)

* SOLR-3813: When a new leader syncs, we need to ask all shards to sync back,
  not just those that are active. (Mark Miller)

* SOLR-3641: CoreContainer is not persisting roles core attribute.
  (hossman, Mark Miller)

* SOLR-3527: SolrCmdDistributor drops some of the important commit attributes
  (maxOptimizeSegments, softCommit, expungeDeletes) when sending a commit to
  replicas. (Andy Laird, Tomás Fernández Löbbe, Mark Miller)

* SOLR-3844: SolrCore reload can fail because it tries to remove the index
  write lock while already holding it. (Mark Miller)

* SOLR-3831: Atomic updates do not distribute correctly to other nodes.
  (Jim Musil, Mark Miller)

* SOLR-3465: Replication causes two searcher warmups.
  (Michael Garski, Mark Miller)

* SOLR-3645: /terms should default to distrib=false. (Nick Cotton, Mark Miller)

* SOLR-3759: Various fixes to the example-DIH configs (Ahmet Arslan, hossman)

* SOLR-3777: Dataimport-UI does not send unchecked checkboxes (Glenn MacStravic
  via steffkes)

* SOLR-3850: DataImportHandler "cacheKey" parameter was incorrectly renamed "cachePk"
  (James Dyer)

* SOLR-3087: Fixed DOMUtil so that code doing attribute validation will
  automatically ignore nodes in the reserved "xml" prefix - in particular this
  fixes some bugs related to xinclude and fieldTypes.
  (Amit Nithian, hossman)

* SOLR-3783: Fixed Pivot Faceting to work with facet.missing=true (hossman)

* SOLR-3869: A PeerSync attempt to its replicas by a candidate leader should
  not fail on o.a.http.conn.ConnectTimeoutException. (Mark Miller)

* SOLR-3875: Fixed index boosts on multi-valued fields when docBoost is used
  (hossman)

* SOLR-3878: Exception when using open-ended range query with CurrencyField (janhoy)

  (Steve Rowe, Robert Muir)

* SOLR-3752: When a leader goes down, have the Overseer clear the leader state
  in cluster.json (Mark Miller)

* SOLR-3751: Add defensive checks for SolrCloud updates and requests that ensure
  the local state matches what we can tell the request expected. (Mark Miller)

  replicas before running the leader process - or if they all do not come up,
  N amount of time. (Jan Høydahl, Per Steffensen, Mark Miller)

* SOLR-3750: Optionally, on session expiration, we can explicitly wait some time before
  running the leader sync process so that we are sure every node participates.
  (Per Steffensen, Mark Miller)

==================  4.0.0-BETA ===================


Versions of Major Components
---------------------
Apache Tika 1.1
Carrot2 3.5.0
Velocity 1.6.4 and Velocity Tools 2.0
Apache UIMA 2.3.1
Apache ZooKeeper 3.3.6

Upgrading from Solr 4.0.0-ALPHA
----------------------

Solr is now much more strict about requiring that the uniqueKeyField feature
(if used) must refer to a field which is not multiValued.  If you upgrade from
an earlier version of Solr and see an error that your uniqueKeyField "can not
be configured to be multivalued" please add 'multiValued="false"' to the
<field /> declaration for your uniqueKeyField.  See SOLR-3682 for more details.

Detailed Change List
----------------------

New Features
----------------------

* LUCENE-4201: Added JapaneseIterationMarkCharFilterFactory to normalize Japanese
  iteration marks. (Robert Muir, Christian Moen)

* SOLR-1856: In Solr Cell, literals should override Tika-parsed values.
  Patch adds a param "literalsOverride" which defaults to true, but can be set
  to "false" to let Tika-parsed values be appended to literal values (Chris Harris, janhoy)

* SOLR-3488: Added a Collection management API for SolrCloud.
  (Tommaso Teofili, Sami Siren, yonik, Mark Miller)

* SOLR-3559: Full deleteByQuery support with SolrCloud distributed indexing.
  All replicas of a shard will be consistent, even if updates arrive in a
  different order on different replicas.  (yonik)

* SOLR-1929: Index encrypted documents with ExtractingUpdateRequestHandler.
  By supplying resource.password=<mypw> or specifying an external file with regular
  expressions matching file names, Solr will decrypt and index PDFs and DOCX formats.
  (janhoy, Yiannis Pericleous)

* SOLR-3562: Add options to remove instance dir or data dir on core unload.
  (Mark Miller, Per Steffensen)

* SOLR-2702: The default directory factory was changed to NRTCachingDirectoryFactory
  which wraps the StandardDirectoryFactory and caches small files for improved
  Near Real-time (NRT) performance. (Mark Miller, yonik)

* SOLR-2616: Include a sample java util logging configuration file.
  (David Smiley, Mark Miller)

* SOLR-3460: Add cloud-scripts directory and a zkcli.sh|bat tool for easy scripting
  and interaction with ZooKeeper. (Mark Miller)

* SOLR-1725: StatelessScriptUpdateProcessorFactory allows users to implement
  the full ScriptUpdateProcessor API using any scripting language with a
  javax.script.ScriptEngineFactory
  (Uri Boness, ehatcher, Simon Rosenthal, hossman)

* SOLR-139: Change to updateable documents to create the document if it doesn't
  already exist.  To assert that the document must exist, use the optimistic
  concurrency feature by specifying a _version_ of 1.  (yonik)

* LUCENE-2510, LUCENE-4044: Migrated Solr's Tokenizer-, TokenFilter-, and
  CharFilterFactories to the lucene-analysis module. To add new analysis
  modules to Solr (like ICU, SmartChinese, Morfologik,...), just drop in
  the JAR files from Lucene's binary distribution into your Solr instance's
  lib folder. The factories are automatically made available with SPI.
  (Chris Male, Robert Muir, Uwe Schindler)

* SOLR-3634, SOLR-3635: CoreContainer and CoreAdminHandler will now remember
  and report back information about failures to initialize SolrCores.  These
  failures will be accessible from the web UI and CoreAdminHandler STATUS
  command until they are "reset" by creating/renaming a SolrCore with the
  same name.  (hossman, steffkes)

* SOLR-1280: Added commented-out example of the new script update processor
  to the example configuration. (ehatcher)

* SOLR-3672: SimplePostTool: Improvements for posting files
  Support for auto mode, recursive and wildcards (janhoy)

Optimizations
----------------------

* SOLR-3708: Add hashCode to ClusterState so that structures built based on the
  ClusterState can be easily cached. (Mark Miller)

* SOLR-3709: Cache the url list created from the ClusterState in CloudSolrServer on each
  request. (Mark Miller, yonik)

* SOLR-3710: Change CloudSolrServer so that update requests are only sent to leaders by
  default. (Mark Miller)

Bug Fixes
----------------------

* SOLR-3582: Our ZooKeeper watchers respond to session events as if they are change events,
  creating undesirable side effects. (Trym R. Møller, Mark Miller)

* SOLR-3467: ExtendedDismax escaping is missing several reserved characters
  (Michael Dodsworth via janhoy)

* SOLR-3587: After reloading a SolrCore, the original Analyzer is still used rather than a new
  one. (Alexey Serba, yonik, rmuir, Mark Miller)

* LUCENE-4185: Fix a bug where CharFilters were wrongly being applied twice. (Michael Froh, rmuir)

* SOLR-3610: After reloading a core, indexing would fail on any newly added fields to the schema. (Brent Mills, rmuir)

* SOLR-3377: edismax fails to correctly parse a fielded query wrapped by parens.
  This regression was introduced in 3.6.  (Bernd Fehling, Jan Høydahl, yonik)

* SOLR-3621: Fix rare concurrency issue when opening a new IndexWriter for replication or rollback.
  (Mark Miller)

* SOLR-1781: Replication index directories not always cleaned up.
  (Markus Jelsma, Terje Sten Bjerkseth, Mark Miller)

* SOLR-3639: Update ZooKeeper to 3.3.6 for a variety of bug fixes. (Mark Miller)

* SOLR-3629: Typo in solr.xml persistence when overriding the solrconfig.xml
  file name using the "config" attribute prevented the override file from being
  used. (Ryan Zezeski, hossman)

* SOLR-3642: Correct broken check for multivalued fields in stats.facet
  (Yandong Yao, hossman)

* SOLR-3660: Velocity: Link to admin page broken (janhoy)

* SOLR-3658: Adding thousands of docs with one UpdateProcessorChain instance can briefly create
  spikes of threads in the thousands. (yonik, Mark Miller)

* SOLR-3656: A core reload now always uses the same dataDir.  (Mark Miller, yonik)

* SOLR-3662: Core reload bugs: a reload always obtained a non-NRT searcher, which
  could go back in time with respect to the previous core's NRT searcher.  Versioning
  did not work correctly across a core reload, and update handler synchronization
  was changed to synchronize on core state since more than on update handler
  can coexist for a single index during a reload. (yonik)

* SOLR-3663: There are a couple of bugs in the sync process when a leader goes down and a
  new leader is elected. (Mark Miller)

* SOLR-3623: Fixed inconsistent treatment of third-party dependencies for
  solr contribs analysis-extras & uima (hossman)

* SOLR-3652: Fixed range faceting to error instead of looping infinitely
  when 'gap' is zero -- or effectively zero due to floating point arithmetic
  underflow. (hossman)

* SOLR-3648: Fixed VelocityResponseWriter template loading in SolrCloud mode.
  For the example configuration, this means /browse now works with SolrCloud.
  (janhoy, ehatcher)

* SOLR-3677: Fixed misleading error message in web ui to distinguish between
  no SolrCores loaded vs. no /admin/ handler available.
  (hossman, steffkes)

* SOLR-3428: SolrCmdDistributor flushAdds/flushDeletes can cause repeated
  adds/deletes to be sent (Mark Miller, Per Steffensen)

* SOLR-3647: DistributedQueue should use our Solr zk client rather than the std zk
  client. ZooKeeper expiration can be permanent otherwise. (Mark Miller)

Other Changes
----------------------

* SOLR-3524: Make discarding punctuation configurable in JapaneseTokenizerFactory.
  The default is to discard punctuation, but this is overridable as an expert option.
  (Kazuaki Hiraga, Jun Ohtani via Christian Moen)

* SOLR-1770: Move the default core instance directory into a collection1 folder.
  (Mark Miller)

* SOLR-3355: Add shard and collection to SolrCore statistics. (Michael Garski, Mark Miller)

* SOLR-3575: solr.xml should default to persist=true (Mark Miller)

* SOLR-3563: Unloading all cores in a SolrCloud collection will now cause the removal of
  that collection's meta data from ZooKeeper. (Mark Miller, Per Steffensen)

* SOLR-3599: Add zkClientTimeout to solr.xml so that it's obvious how to change it and so
  that you can change it with a system property. (Mark Miller)

* SOLR-3609: Change Solr's expanded webapp directory to be at a consistent path called
  solr-webapp rather than a temporary directory. (Mark Miller)

* SOLR-3600: Raise the default zkClientTimeout from 10 seconds to 15 seconds. (Mark Miller)

* SOLR-3215: Clone SolrInputDocument when distrib indexing so that update processors after
  the distrib update process do not process the document twice. (Mark Miller)

* SOLR-3683: Improved error handling if an <analyzer> contains both an
  explicit class attribute, as well as nested factories. (hossman)

* SOLR-3682: Fail to parse schema.xml if uniqueKeyField is multivalued (hossman)

* SOLR-2115: DIH no longer requires the "config" parameter to be specified in solrconfig.xml.
  Instead, the configuration is loaded and parsed with every import.  This allows the use of
  a different configuration with each import, and makes correcting configuration errors simpler.
  Also, the configuration itself can be passed using the "dataConfig" parameter rather than
  using a file (this previously worked in debug mode only).  When configuration errors are
  encountered, the error message is returned in XML format.  (James Dyer)

* SOLR-3439: Make SolrCell easier to use out of the box. Also improves "/browse" to display
  rich-text documents correctly, along with facets for author and content_type.
  With the new "content" field, highlighting of body is supported. See also SOLR-3672 for
  easier posting of a whole directory structure. (Jack Krupansky, janhoy)

* SOLR-3579: SolrCloud view should default to the graph view rather than tree view.
  (steffkes, Mark Miller)

More information about this release, including any errata related to the
release notes, upgrade instructions, or other changes may be found online at:
   https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/solr/Solr4.0


Versions of Major Components
---------------------
Apache Tika 1.1
Carrot2 3.5.0
Velocity 1.6.4 and Velocity Tools 2.0
Apache UIMA 2.3.1
Apache ZooKeeper 3.3.4


Upgrading from Solr 3.6-dev
----------------------

* The Lucene index format has changed and as a result, once you upgrade,
  previous versions of Solr will no longer be able to read your indices.
  In a master/slave configuration, all searchers/slaves should be upgraded
  before the master.  If the master were to be updated first, the older
  searchers would not be able to read the new index format.

* Setting abortOnConfigurationError=false is no longer supported
  (since it has never worked properly).  Solr will now warn you if
  you attempt to set this configuration option at all. (see SOLR-1846)

* The default logic for the 'mm' param of the 'dismax' QParser has
  been changed.  If no 'mm' param is specified (either in the query,
  or as a default in solrconfig.xml) then the effective value of the
  'q.op' param (either in the query or as a default in solrconfig.xml
  or from the 'defaultOperator' option in schema.xml) is used to
  influence the behavior.  If q.op is effectively "AND" then mm=100%.
  If q.op is effectively "OR" then mm=0%.  Users who wish to force the
  legacy behavior should set a default value for the 'mm' param in
  their solrconfig.xml file.

* The VelocityResponseWriter is no longer built into the core.  Its JAR and
  dependencies now need to be added (via <lib> or solr/home lib inclusion),
  and it needs to be registered in solrconfig.xml like this:
    <queryResponseWriter name="velocity" class="solr.VelocityResponseWriter"/>

* The update request parameter to choose Update Request Processor Chain is
  renamed from "update.processor" to "update.chain". The old parameter was
  deprecated but still working since Solr3.2, but is now removed
  entirely.

* The <indexDefaults> and <mainIndex> sections of solrconfig.xml are discontinued
  and replaced with the <indexConfig> section. There are also better defaults.
  When migrating, if you don't know what your old settings mean, simply delete
  both <indexDefaults> and <mainIndex> sections. If you have customizations,
  put them in <indexConfig> section - with same syntax as before.

* Two of the SolrServer subclasses in SolrJ were renamed/replaced.
  CommonsHttpSolrServer is now HttpSolrServer, and
  StreamingUpdateSolrServer is now ConcurrentUpdateSolrServer.

* The PingRequestHandler no longer looks for a <healthcheck/> option in the
  (legacy) <admin> section of solrconfig.xml.  Users who wish to take
  advantage of this feature should configure a "healthcheckFile" init param
  directly on the  PingRequestHandler.  As part of this change, relative file
  paths have been fixed to be resolved against the data dir.  See the example
  solrconfig.xml and SOLR-1258 for more details.

* Due to low level changes to support SolrCloud, the uniqueKey field can no
  longer be populated via <copyField/> or <field default=...> in the
  schema.xml.  Users wishing to have Solr automatically generate a uniqueKey
  value when adding documents should instead use an instance of
  solr.UUIDUpdateProcessorFactory in their update processor chain.  See
  SOLR-2796 for more details.

----------------------

New Features
----------------------

* SOLR-3272: Solr filter factory for MorfologikFilter (Polish lemmatisation).
  (Rafał Kuć via Dawid Weiss, Steven Rowe, Uwe Schindler).

* SOLR-571: The autowarmCount for LRUCaches (LRUCache and FastLRUCache) now
  supports "percentages" which get evaluated  relative the current size of
  the cache when warming happens.
  (Tomás Fernández Löbbe and hossman)

* SOLR-1932: New relevancy function queries: termfreq, tf, docfreq, idf
  norm, maxdoc, numdocs. (yonik)

* SOLR-1665: Add debug component options for timings, results and query info only (gsingers, hossman, yonik)

  DirectSpellChecker to retrieve correction candidates directly from the term dictionary using
  levenshtein automata.  (James Dyer, rmuir)

* SOLR-1873, SOLR-2358: SolrCloud - added shared/central config and core/shard management via zookeeper,
  built-in load balancing, and distributed indexing.
  (Jamie Johnson, Sami Siren, Ted Dunning, yonik, Mark Miller)
  Additional Work:
  - SOLR-2324: SolrCloud solr.xml parameters are not persisted by CoreContainer.
    (Massimo Schiavon, Mark Miller)
  - SOLR-2287: Allow users to query by multiple, compatible collections with SolrCloud.
    (Soheb Mahmood, Alex Cowell, Mark Miller)
  - SOLR-2622: ShowFileRequestHandler does not work in SolrCloud mode.
    (Stefan Matheis, Mark Miller)
  - SOLR-3108: Error in SolrCloud's replica lookup code when replica's are hosted in same Solr instance.

  - SOLR-3080: Remove shard info from zookeeper when SolrCore is explicitly unloaded.
    (yonik, Mark Miller, siren)
  - SOLR-3437: Recovery issues a spurious commit to the cluster. (Trym R. Møller via Mark Miller)
  - SOLR-2822: Skip update processors already run on other nodes (hossman)

* SOLR-1566: Transforming documents in the ResponseWriters.  This will allow
  for more complex results in responses and open the door for function queries
  as results.
  (ryan with patches from grant, noble, cmale, yonik, Jan Høydahl,
  Arul Kalaipandian, Luca Cavanna, hossman)
  - SOLR-2037: Thanks to SOLR-1566, documents boosted by the QueryElevationComponent
    can be marked as boosted.  (gsingers, ryan, yonik)

* SOLR-2396: Add CollationField, which is much more efficient than
  the Solr 3.x CollationKeyFilterFactory, and also supports
  Locale-sensitive range queries. (rmuir)

* SOLR-2338: Add support for using <similarity/> in a schema's fieldType,
  for customizing scoring on a per-field basis. (hossman, yonik, rmuir)

* SOLR-2335: New 'field("...")' function syntax for referring to complex
  field names (containing whitespace or special characters) in functions.

* SOLR-2383: /browse improvements: generalize range and date facet display
  (Jan Høydahl via yonik)

* SOLR-2272: Pseudo-join queries / filters.  Examples:
  - To restrict to the set of parents with at least one blue-eyed child:
      fq={!join from=parent to=name}eyes:blue
  - To restrict to the set of children with at least one blue-eyed parent:
      fq={!join from=name to=parent}eyes:blue
  (yonik)

* SOLR-1942: Added the ability to select postings format per fieldType in schema.xml
  as well as support custom Codecs in solrconfig.xml.
  (simonw via rmuir)

* SOLR-2136: Boolean type added to function queries, along with
  new functions exists(), if(), and(), or(), xor(), not(), def(),
  and true and false constants. (yonik)

* SOLR-2491: Add support for using spellcheck collation in conjunction
  with grouping. Note that the number of hits returned for collations
  is the number of ungrouped hits.  (James Dyer via rmuir)

* SOLR-1298: Return FunctionQuery as pseudo field.  The solr 'fl' param
  now supports functions.  For example:  fl=id,sum(x,y) -- NOTE: only
  functions with fast random access are recommended. (yonik, ryan)

* SOLR-705: Optionally return shard info with each document in distributed
  search.  Use fl=id,[shard]  to return the shard url.  (ryan)

* SOLR-2417: Add explain info directly to return documents using
  ?fl=id,[explain] (ryan)

* SOLR-2533: Converted ValueSource.ValueSourceSortField over to new rewriteable Lucene
  SortFields.  ValueSourceSortField instances must be rewritten before they can be used.
  This is done by SolrIndexSearcher when necessary. (Chris Male).

* SOLR-2193, SOLR-2565: You may now specify a 'soft' commit when committing. This will
  use Lucene's NRT feature to avoid guaranteeing documents are on stable storage in exchange
  for faster reopen times. There is also a new 'soft' autocommit tracker that can be
  configured. (Mark Miller, Robert Muir)

* SOLR-2399: Updated Solr Admin interface.  New look and feel with per core administration
  and many new options.  (Stefan Matheis via ryan)

* SOLR-1032: CSV handler now supports "literal.field_name=value" parameters.
  (Simon Rosenthal, ehatcher)

* SOLR-2656: realtime-get, efficiently retrieves the latest stored fields for specified
  documents, even if they are not yet searchable (i.e. without reopening a searcher)
  (yonik)

* SOLR-2703: Added support for Lucene's "surround" query parser. (Simon Rosenthal, ehatcher)

* SOLR-2754: Added factories for several ranking algorithms:
    - BM25SimilarityFactory: Okapi BM25
    - DFRSimilarityFactory: Divergence from Randomness models
    - IBSimilarityFactory: Information-based models
    - LMDirichletSimilarity: LM with Dirichlet smoothing
    - LMJelinekMercerSimilarity: LM with Jelinek-Mercer smoothing
  (David Mark Nemeskey, Robert Muir)

* SOLR-2134 Trie* fields should support sortMissingLast=true, and deprecate Sortable* Field Types
  (Ryan McKinley, Mike McCandless, Uwe Schindler, Erick Erickson)

* SOLR-2438 added MultiTermAwareComponent to the various classes to allow automatic lowercasing
  for multiterm queries (wildcards, regex, prefix, range, etc). You can now optionally specify a
  "multiterm" analyzer in our schema.xml, but Solr should "do the right thing" if you don't
  specify <analyzer type="multiterm"> (Pete Sturge Erick Erickson, Mentoring from Seeley and Muir)

* SOLR-2481: Add support for commitWithin in DataImportHandler (Sami Siren via yonik)

* SOLR-2992: Add support for IndexWriter.prepareCommit() via prepareCommit=true
  on update URLs. (yonik)

* SOLR-2906: Added LFU cache options to Solr. (Shawn Heisey via Erick Erickson)

* SOLR-3069: Ability to add openSearcher=false to not open a searcher when doing
  a hard commit.  commitWithin now only invokes a softCommit. (yonik)

* SOLR-2802: New FieldMutatingUpdateProcessor and Factory to simplify the
  development of UpdateProcessors that modify field values of documents as
  they are indexed. Also includes several useful new implementations:
    - RemoveBlankFieldUpdateProcessorFactory
    - TrimFieldUpdateProcessorFactory
    - HTMLStripFieldUpdateProcessorFactory
    - RegexReplaceProcessorFactory
    - FieldLengthUpdateProcessorFactory
    - ConcatFieldUpdateProcessorFactory
    - FirstFieldValueUpdateProcessorFactory
    - LastFieldValueUpdateProcessorFactory
    - MinFieldValueUpdateProcessorFactory
    - MaxFieldValueUpdateProcessorFactory
    - TruncateFieldUpdateProcessorFactory
    - IgnoreFieldUpdateProcessorFactory
  (hossman, janhoy)

* SOLR-3120: Optional post filtering for spatial queries bbox and geofilt
  for LatLonType. (yonik)

* SOLR-2459: Expose LogLevel selection with a RequestHandler rather then servlet
  (Stefan Matheis, Upayavira, ryan)

* SOLR-3134: Include shard info in distributed response when shards.info=true
  (Russell Black, ryan)

* SOLR-2898: Support grouped faceting. (Martijn van Groningen)
  Additional Work:
  - SOLR-3406: Extended grouped faceting support to facet.query and facet.range parameters.
               (David Boychuck, Martijn van Groningen)

* SOLR-2949: QueryElevationComponent is now supported with distributed search.
  (Mark Miller, yonik)

* SOLR-3221: Added the ability to directly configure aspects of the concurrency
 and thread-pooling used within distributed search in solr. This allows for finer
 grained controlled and can be tuned by end users to target their own specific
 requirements. This builds on the work of the HttpCommComponent and uses the same configuration
 block to configure the thread pool. The default configuration has
 the same behaviour as solr 3.5, favouring throughput over latency. More
 information can be found on the wiki (http://wiki.apache.org/solr/SolrConfigXml) (Greg Bowyer)

* SOLR-3278: Negative boost support to the Extended Dismax Query Parser Boost Query (bq).
  (James Dyer)

* SOLR-3255: OpenExchangeRates.Org Exchange Rate Provider for CurrencyField (janhoy)

* SOLR-3358: Logging events are captured and available from the /admin/logging
  request handler. (ryan)

* SOLR-1535: PreAnalyzedField type provides a functionality to index (and optionally store)
  field content that was already processed and split into tokens using some external processing
  chain. Serialization format is pluggable, and defaults to JSON. (ab)

* SOLR-3363: Consolidated Exceptions in Analysis Factories so they only throw
  InitializationExceptions (Chris Male)

* SOLR-2690: New support for a "TZ" request param which overrides the TimeZone
  used when rounding Dates in DateMath expressions for the entire request
  (all date range queries and date faceting is affected).  The default TZ
  is still UTC.  (David Schlotfeldt, hossman)

* SOLR-3402: Analysis Factories are now configured with their Lucene Version
  throw setLuceneMatchVersion, rather than through the Map passed to init.
  Parsing and simple error checking for the Version is now done inside
  the code that creates the Analysis Factories. (Chris Male)

* SOLR-3178: Optimistic locking.  If a _version_ is provided with an update
  that does not match the version in the index, an HTTP 409 error (Conflict)
  will result.  (Per Steffensen, yonik)

* SOLR-139: Updateable documents.  JSON Example:
  {"id":"mydoc", "f1":{"set":10}, "f2":{"add":20}}  will result in field "f1"
  being set to 10, "f2" having an additional value of 20 added, and all
  other existing fields unchanged.  All source fields must be stored for
  this feature to work correctly.  (Ryan McKinley, Erik Hatcher, yonik)

* SOLR-2857: Support XML,CSV,JSON, and javabin in a single RequestHandler and
  choose the correct ContentStreamLoader based on Content-Type header.  This
  also deprecates the existing [Xml,JSON,CSV,Binary,Xslt]UpdateRequestHandler.
  (ryan)

* SOLR-2585: Context-Sensitive Spelling Suggestions & Collations.  This adds support
  for the "spellcheck.alternativeTermCount" & "spellcheck.maxResultsForSuggest"
  parameters, letting users receive suggestions even when all the queried terms
  exist in the dictionary.  This differs from "spellcheck.onlyMorePopular" in
  that the suggestions need not consist entirely of terms with a greater document
  frequency than the queried terms. (James Dyer)

* SOLR-2058: Edismax query parser to allow "phrase slop" to be specified per-field
  on the pf/pf2/pf3 parameters using optional "FieldName~slop^boost" syntax.  The
  prior "FieldName^boost" syntax is still accepted.  In such cases the value on the
  "ps" parameter serves as the default slop.  (Ron Mayer via James Dyer)

* SOLR-3495: New UpdateProcessors have been added to create default values for
  configured fields.  These works similarly to the <field default="..."/>
  option in schema.xml, but are applied in the UpdateProcessorChain, so they
  may be used prior to other UpdateProcessors, or to generate a uniqueKey field
  value when using the DistributedUpdateProcessor (ie: SolrCloud)
    TimestampUpdateProcessorFactory
    UUIDUpdateProcessorFactory
    DefaultValueUpdateProcessorFactory
  (hossman)

* SOLR-2993: Add WordBreakSolrSpellChecker to offer suggestions by combining adjacent
  query terms and/or breaking terms into multiple words.  This spellchecker can be
  configured with a traditional checker (ie: DirectSolrSpellChecker).  The results
  are combined and collations can contain a mix of corrections from both spellcheckers.
  (James Dyer)

* SOLR-3508: Simplify JSON update format for deletes as well as allow
  version specification for optimistic locking.  Examples:
    - {"delete":"myid"}
    - {"delete":["id1","id2","id3"]}
    - {"delete":{"id":"myid", "_version_":123456789}}
  (yonik)

* SOLR-3211:  Allow parameter overrides in conjunction with "spellcheck.maxCollationTries".
  To do so, use parameters starting with "spellcheck.collateParam."  For instance, to
  override the "mm" parameter, specify "spellcheck.collateParam.mm".  This is helpful
  in cases where testing spellcheck collations for result counts should use different
  parameters from the main query (James Dyer)

* SOLR-2599: CloneFieldUpdateProcessorFactory provides similar functionality
  to schema.xml's <copyField/> declaration but as an update processor that can
  be combined with other processors in any order. (Jan Høydahl & hossman)

* SOLR-3351: eDismax: ps2 and ps3 params (janhoy)

* SOLR-3542: Add WeightedFragListBuilder for FVH and set it to default fragListBuilder
  in example solrconfig.xml. (Sebastian Lutze, koji)

* SOLR-2396: Add ICUCollationField to contrib/analysis-extras, which is much
  more efficient than the Solr 3.x ICUCollationKeyFilterFactory, and also
  supports Locale-sensitive range queries.  (rmuir)


Optimizations
----------------------

* SOLR-1875: Per-segment field faceting for single valued string fields.
  Enable with facet.method=fcs, control the number of threads used with
  the "threads" local param on the facet.field param.  This algorithm will
  only be faster in the presence of rapid index changes.  (yonik)

* SOLR-1904: When facet.enum.cache.minDf > 0 and the base doc set is a
  SortedIntSet, convert to HashDocSet for better performance. (yonik)

* SOLR-2092: Speed up single-valued and multi-valued "fc" faceting. Typical
  improvement is 5%, but can be much greater (up to 10x faster) when facet.offset
  is very large (deep paging). (yonik)

* SOLR-2193, SOLR-2565: The default Solr update handler has been improved so
  that it uses fewer locks, keeps the IndexWriter open rather than closing it
  on each commit (ie commits no longer wait for background merges to complete),
  works with SolrCore to provide faster 'soft' commits, and has an improved API
  that requires less instanceof special casing. (Mark Miller, Robert Muir)
  Additional Work:
  - SOLR-2697: commit and autocommit operations don't reset
    DirectUpdateHandler2.numDocsPending stats attribute.
    (Alexey Serba, Mark Miller)

* SOLR-2950: The QueryElevationComponent now avoids using the FieldCache and looking up
  every document id (gsingers, yonik)

Bug Fixes
----------------------
* SOLR-3139: Make ConcurrentUpdateSolrServer send UpdateRequest.getParams()
  as HTTP request params (siren)

* SOLR-3165: Cannot use DIH in Solrcloud + Zookeeper (Alexey Serba,
  Mark Miller, siren)

* SOLR-3068: Occasional NPE in ThreadDumpHandler (siren)

* SOLR-2762: FSTLookup could return duplicate results or one results less
  than requested. (David Smiley, Dawid Weiss)

* SOLR-2741: Bugs in facet range display in trunk (janhoy)

* SOLR-1908: Fixed SignatureUpdateProcessor to fail to initialize on
  invalid config.  Specifically: a signatureField that does not exist,
  or overwriteDupes=true with a signatureField that is not indexed.
  (hossman)

* SOLR-1824: IndexSchema will now fail to initialize if there is a
  problem initializing one of the fields or field types. (hossman)

* SOLR-1928: TermsComponent didn't correctly break ties for non-text
  fields sorted by count. (yonik)

* SOLR-2107: MoreLikeThisHandler doesn't work with alternate qparsers. (yonik)

* SOLR-2108: Fixed false positives when using wildcard queries on fields with reversed
  wildcard support. For example, a query of *zemog* would match documents that contain
  'gomez'.  (Landon Kuhn via Robert Muir)

* SOLR-1962: SolrCore#initIndex should not use a mix of indexPath and newIndexPath (Mark Miller)

* SOLR-2275: fix DisMax 'mm' parsing to be tolerant of whitespace
  (Erick Erickson via hossman)

* SOLR-2193, SOLR-2565, SOLR-2651: SolrCores now properly share IndexWriters across SolrCore reloads.
  (Mark Miller, Robert Muir)
  Additional Work:
  - SOLR-2705: On reload, IndexWriterProvider holds onto the initial SolrCore it was created with.
    (Yury Kats, Mark Miller)

* SOLR-2682: Remove addException() in SimpleFacet. FacetComponent no longer catches and embeds
  exceptions occurred during facet processing, it throws HTTP 400 or 500 exceptions instead. (koji)

* SOLR-2654: Directorys used by a SolrCore are now closed when they are no longer used.
  (Mark Miller)

* SOLR-2854: Now load URL content stream data (via stream.url) when called for during request handling,
  rather than loading URL content streams automatically regardless of use.
  (David Smiley and Ryan McKinley via ehatcher)

* SOLR-2829: Fix problem with false-positives due to incorrect
  equals methods. (Yonik Seeley, Hossman, Erick Erickson.
  Marc Tinnemeyer caught the bug)

* SOLR-2848: Removed 'instanceof AbstractLuceneSpellChecker' hacks from distributed spellchecking code,
  and added a merge() method to SolrSpellChecker instead. Previously if you extended SolrSpellChecker
  your spellchecker would not work in distributed fashion.  (James Dyer via rmuir)

* SOLR-2509: StringIndexOutOfBoundsException in the spellchecker collate when the term contains
  a hyphen. (Thomas Gambier caught the bug, Steffen Godskesen did the patch, via Erick Erickson)

* SOLR-1730: Made it clearer when a core failed to load as well as better logging when the
  QueryElevationComponent fails to properly initialize (gsingers)

* SOLR-1520: QueryElevationComponent now supports non-string ids (gsingers)

* SOLR-3037: When using binary format in solrj the codec screws up parameters
  (Sami Siren, Jörg Maier  via yonik)

* SOLR-3062: A join in the main query was not respecting any filters pushed
  down to it via acceptDocs since LUCENE-1536. (Mike Hugo, yonik)

* SOLR-3214: If you use multiple fl entries rather than a comma separated list, all but the first
  entry can be ignored if you are using distributed search. (Tomás Fernández Löbbe via Mark Miller)

* SOLR-3352: eDismax: pf2 should kick in for a query with 2 terms (janhoy)

* SOLR-3361: ReplicationHandler "maxNumberOfBackups" doesn't work if backups are triggered on commit
  (James Dyer, Tomás Fernández Löbbe)

* SOLR-2605: fixed tracking of the 'defaultCoreName' in CoreContainer so that
  CoreAdminHandler could return consistent information regardless of whether
  there is a a default core name or not. (steffkes, hossman)

* SOLR-3370: fixed CSVResponseWriter to respect globs in the 'fl' param
  (Keith Fligg via hossman)

* SOLR-3436: Group count incorrect when not all shards are queried in the second
  pass. (Francois Perron, Martijn van Groningen)

* SOLR-3454: Exception when using result grouping with main=true and using
  wt=javabin. (Ludovic Boutros, Martijn van Groningen)

* SOLR-3446: Better errors when PatternTokenizerFactory is configured with
  an invalid pattern, and include the 'name' whenever possible in plugin init
  error messages. (hossman)

* LUCENE-4075: Cleaner path usage in TestXPathEntityProcessor
  (Greg Bowyer via hossman)

* SOLR-2923: IllegalArgumentException when using useFilterForSortedQuery on an
  empty index. (Adrien Grand via Mark Miller)

* SOLR-2352: Fixed TermVectorComponent so that it will not fail if the fl
  param contains globs or psuedo-fields (hossman)

* SOLR-3541: add missing solrj dependencies to binary packages.
  (Thijs Vonk via siren)

* SOLR-3522: fixed parsing of the 'literal()' function (hossman)

* SOLR-3548: Fixed a bug in the cachability of queries using the {!join}
  parser or the strdist() function, as well as some minor improvements to
  the hashCode implementation of {!bbox} and {!geofilt} queries.
  (hossman)

* SOLR-3470: contrib/clustering: custom Carrot2 tokenizer and stemmer factories
  are respected now (Stanislaw Osinski, Dawid Weiss)

* SOLR-3430: Added a new DIH test against a real SQL database.  Fixed problems
  revealed by this new test related to  the expanded cache support added to
  3.6/SOLR-2382 (James Dyer)

* SOLR-1958: When using the MailEntityProcessor, import would fail if
  fetchMailsSince was not specified. (Max Lynch via James Dyer)

* SOLR-4289: Admin UI - JVM memory bar - dark grey "used" width is too small
  (steffkes, elyograg)

Other Changes
----------------------

* SOLR-1846: Eliminate support for the abortOnConfigurationError
  option.  It has never worked very well, and in recent versions of
  Solr hasn't worked at all.  (hossman)

* SOLR-1889: The default logic for the 'mm' param of DismaxQParser and
  ExtendedDismaxQParser has been changed to be determined based on the

  using Generics where applicable in method/object declarations, and
  adding @SuppressWarnings("unchecked") when appropriate (hossman)

* SOLR-2375: Suggester Lookup implementations now store trie data
  and load it back on init. This means that large tries don't have to be
  rebuilt on every commit or core reload. (ab)

  in the XMLResponseWriter was removed.  XMLResponseWriter only
  no longer work with values less then 2.2 (ryan)

* SOLR-2698: Enhance CoreAdmin STATUS command to return index size.
  (Yury Kats, hossman, Mark Miller)

* SOLR-2654: The same Directory instance is now always used across a SolrCore so that
  it's easier to add other DirectoryFactory's without static caching hacks.
  (Mark Miller)

* LUCENE-3286: 'luke' ant target has been disabled due to incompatibilities with XML
  queryparser location (Chris Male)

* SOLR-1897: The data dir from the core descriptor should override the data dir from
  the solrconfig.xml rather than the other way round. (Mark Miller)

* SOLR-2756: Maven configuration: Excluded transitive stax:stax-api dependency
  from org.codehaus.woodstox:wstx-asl dependency. (David Smiley via Steve Rowe)

* SOLR-2588: Moved VelocityResponseWriter back to contrib module in order to
  remove it as a mandatory core dependency.  (ehatcher)

  by default.  However the Content-Type can be overwritten and is set to text/plain in
  the example configuration. (Uri Boness, Chris Male)

* SOLR-2607: Removed deprecated client/ruby directory, which included solr-ruby and flare.
  (ehatcher)

* SOLR-3032: logOnce from SolrException logOnce and all the supporting
  structure is gone. abortOnConfigurationError is also gone as it is no longer referenced.
  Errors should be caught and logged at the top-most level or logged and NOT propagated up the
  chain. (Erick Erickson)

* SOLR-2105: Remove support for deprecated "update.processor" (since 3.2), in favor of
  "update.chain" (janhoy)

  instance type (Chris Male)

* SOLR-3388: HTTP caching is now disabled by default for RequestUpdateHandlers. (ryan)

* SOLR-3309: web.xml now specifies metadata-complete=true (which requires
  Servlet 2.5) to prevent servlet containers from scanning class annotations
  on startup.  This allows for faster startup times on some servlet containers.
  (Bill Bell, hossman)

* SOLR-1893: Refactored some common code from LRUCache and FastLRUCache into
  SolrCacheBase (Tomás Fernández Löbbe via hossman)

* SOLR-3403: Deprecated Analysis Factories now log their own deprecation messages.
  No logging support is provided by Factory parent classes. (Chris Male)

* SOLR-1258: PingRequestHandler is now directly configured with a
  "healthcheckFile" instead of looking for the legacy
  <admin><healthcheck/></admin> syntax.  Filenames specified as relative
  paths have been fixed so that they are resolved against the data dir
  instead of the CWD of the java process. (hossman)

* SOLR-3083: JMX beans now report Numbers as numeric values rather then String
  (Tagged Siteops, Greg Bowyer via ryan)

* SOLR-2796: Due to low level changes to support SolrCloud, the uniqueKey
  field can no longer be populated via <copyField/> or <field default=...>
  in the schema.xml.

* SOLR-3534: The Dismax and eDismax query parsers will fall back on the 'df' parameter
  when 'qf' is absent.  And if neither is present nor the schema default search field

* SOLR-3262: The "threads" feature of DIH is removed (deprecated in Solr 3.6)
  (James Dyer)

==================  3.6.0  ==================
More information about this release, including any errata related to the
release notes, upgrade instructions, or other changes may be found online at:
   https://wiki.apache.org/solr/Solr3.6

Upgrading from Solr 3.5
----------------------
* SOLR-2983: As a consequence of moving the code which sets a MergePolicy from SolrIndexWriter to SolrIndexConfig,
  (custom) MergePolicies should now have an empty constructor; thus an IndexWriter should not be passed as constructor
  parameter but instead set using the setIndexWriter() method.

* As doGet() methods in SimplePostTool was changed to static, the client applications of this
  class need to be recompiled.

* In Solr version 3.5 and earlier, HTMLStripCharFilter had known bugs in the
  character offsets it provided, triggering e.g. exceptions in highlighting.
  HTMLStripCharFilter has been re-implemented, addressing this and other
  issues.  See the entry for LUCENE-3690 in the Bug Fixes section below for a
  detailed list of changes.  For people who depend on the behavior of
  HTMLStripCharFilter in Solr version 3.5 and earlier: the old implementation
  (bugs and all) is preserved as LegacyHTMLStripCharFilter.

* As of Solr 3.6, the <indexDefaults> and <mainIndex> sections of solrconfig.xml are deprecated
  and replaced with a new <indexConfig> section. Read more in SOLR-1052 below.

* SOLR-3040: The DIH's admin UI (dataimport.jsp) now requires DIH request handlers to start with
  a '/'. (dsmiley)

* SOLR-3161: <requestDispatcher handleSelect="false"> is now the default. An existing config will
  probably work as-is because handleSelect was explicitly enabled in default configs. HandleSelect
  makes /select work as well as enables the 'qt' parameter. Instead, consider explicitly
  configuring /select as is done in the example solrconfig.xml, and register your other search
  handlers with a leading '/' which is a recommended practice.  (David Smiley, Erik Hatcher)

* SOLR-3161: Don't use the 'qt' parameter with a leading '/'.  It probably won't work in 4.0
  and it's now limited in 3.6 to SearchHandler subclasses that aren't lazy-loaded.

* SOLR-2724: Specifying <defaultSearchField> and <solrQueryParser defaultOperator="..."/> in
  schema.xml is now considered deprecated.  Instead you are encouraged to specify these via the "df"
  and "q.op" parameters in your request handler definition.  (David Smiley)

* Bugs found and fixed in the SignatureUpdateProcessor that previously caused
  some documents to produce the same signature even when the configured fields
  contained distinct (non-String) values.  Users of SignatureUpdateProcessor
  are strongly advised that they should re-index as document signatures may
  have now changed. (see SOLR-3200 & SOLR-3226 for details)

New Features
----------------------
* SOLR-2020: Add Java client that uses Apache Http Components http client (4.x).
  (Chantal Ackermann, Ryan McKinley, Yonik Seeley, siren)

* SOLR-2854: Now load URL content stream data (via stream.url) when called for during request handling,
  rather than loading URL content streams automatically regardless of use.
  (David Smiley and Ryan McKinley via ehatcher)

* SOLR-2904: BinaryUpdateRequestHandler should be able to accept multiple update requests from
  a stream (shalin)

* SOLR-1565: StreamingUpdateSolrServer supports RequestWriter API and therefore, javabin update
  format (shalin)

* SOLR-2438 added MultiTermAwareComponent to the various classes to allow automatic lowercasing
  for multiterm queries (wildcards, regex, prefix, range, etc). You can now optionally specify a
  "multiterm" analyzer in our schema.xml, but Solr should "do the right thing" if you don't
  specify <fieldType="multiterm"> (Pete Sturge Erick Erickson, Mentoring from Seeley and Muir)

* SOLR-2919: Added support for localized range queries when the analysis chain uses
  CollationKeyFilter or ICUCollationKeyFilter.  (Michael Sokolov, rmuir)

* SOLR-2982: Added BeiderMorseFilterFactory for Beider-Morse (BMPM) phonetic encoder. Upgrades
  commons-codec to version 1.6  (Brooke Schreier Ganz, rmuir)

* SOLR-1843: A new "rootName" attribute is now available when
  configuring <jmx/> in solrconfig.xml.  If this attribute is set,
  Solr will use it as the root name for all MBeans Solr exposes via
  JMX.  The default root name is "solr" followed by the core name.
  (Constantijn Visinescu, hossman)

* SOLR-2906: Added LFU cache options to Solr. (Shawn Heisey via Erick Erickson)

* SOLR-3036: Ability to specify overwrite=false on the URL for XML updates.
  (Sami Siren via yonik)

* SOLR-2603: Add the encoding function for alternate fields in highlighting.
  (Massimo Schiavon, koji)

* SOLR-1729: Evaluation of NOW for date math is done only once per request for
  consistency, and is also propagated to shards in distributed search.
  Adding a parameter NOW=<time_in_ms> to the request will override the
  current time.  (Peter Sturge, yonik, Simon Willnauer)

* SOLR-1709: Distributed support for Date and Numeric Range Faceting
  (Peter Sturge, David Smiley, hossman, Simon Willnauer)

* SOLR-3054, LUCENE-3671: Add TypeTokenFilterFactory that creates TypeTokenFilter
  that filters tokens based on their TypeAttribute.  (Tommaso Teofili via
  Uwe Schindler)

* LUCENE-3305, SOLR-3056: Added Kuromoji morphological analyzer for Japanese.
  See the 'text_ja' fieldtype in the example to get started.
  (Christian Moen, Masaru Hasegawa via Robert Muir)

* SOLR-1860: StopFilterFactory, CommonGramsFilterFactory, and
  CommonGramsQueryFilterFactory can optionally read stopwords in Snowball
  format (specify format="snowball").  (Robert Muir)

* SOLR-3105: ElisionFilterFactory optionally allows the parameter
  ignoreCase (default=false).  (Robert Muir)

* LUCENE-3714: Add WFSTLookupFactory, a suggester that uses a weighted FST
  for more fine-grained suggestions.  (Mike McCandless, Dawid Weiss, Robert Muir)

* SOLR-3143: Add SuggestQueryConverter, a QueryConverter intended for
  auto-suggesters. (Robert Muir)

* SOLR-3033: ReplicationHandler's backup command now supports a 'maxNumberOfBackups'
  init param that can be used to delete all but the most recent N backups. (Torsten Krah, James Dyer)

* SOLR-2202: Currency FieldType, whith support for currencies and exchange rates
  (Greg Fodor & Andrew Morrison via janhoy, rmuir, Uwe Schindler)

* SOLR-3026: eDismax: Locking down which fields can be explicitly queried (user fields aka uf)
  (janhoy, hossmann, Tomás Fernández Löbbe)

* SOLR-2826: URLClassify Update Processor (janhoy)

* SOLR-2764: Create a NorwegianLightStemmer and NorwegianMinimalStemmer (janhoy)

* SOLR-3221: Added the ability to directly configure aspects of the concurrency
 and thread-pooling used within distributed search in solr. This allows for finer
 grained controlled and can be tuned by end users to target their own specific
 requirements. This builds on the work of the HttpCommComponent and uses the same configuration
 block to configure the thread pool. The default configuration has
 the same behaviour as solr 3.5, favouring throughput over latency. More
 information can be found on the wiki (http://wiki.apache.org/solr/SolrConfigXml) (Greg Bowyer)

* SOLR-2001: The query component will substitute an empty query that matches
  no documents if the query parser returns null.  This also prevents an
  exception from being thrown by the default parser if "q" is missing. (yonik)
  - SOLR-435: if q is "" then it's also acceptable. (dsmiley, hoss)

* SOLR-2919: Added parametric tailoring options to ICUCollationKeyFilterFactory.
  These can be used to customize range query/sort behavior, for example to
  support numeric collation, ignore punctuation/whitespace, ignore accents but
  not case, control whether upper/lowercase values are sorted first, etc.  (rmuir)

* SOLR-2346: Add a chance to set content encoding explicitly via content type
  of stream for extracting request handler.  This is convenient when Tika's
  auto detector cannot detect encoding, especially the text file is too short
  to detect encoding. (koji)

* SOLR-1499: Added SolrEntityProcessor that imports data from another Solr core
  or instance based on a specified query.
  (Lance Norskog, Erik Hatcher, Pulkit Singhal, Ahmet Arslan, Luca Cavanna,
  Martijn van Groningen)

* SOLR-3190: Minor improvements to SolrEntityProcessor. Add more consistency
  between solr parameters and parameters used in SolrEntityProcessor and
  ability to specify a custom HttpClient instance.
  (Luca Cavanna via Martijn van Groningen)

* SOLR-2382: Added pluggable cache support to DIH so that any Entity can be
  made cache-able by adding the "cacheImpl" parameter.  Include
  "SortedMapBackedCache" to provide in-memory caching (as previously this was
  the only option when using CachedSqlEntityProcessor).  Users can provide
  their own implementations of DIHCache for other caching strategies.
  Deprecate CachedSqlEntityProcessor in favor of specifing "cacheImpl" with
  SqlEntityProcessor.  Make SolrWriter implement DIHWriter and allow the
  possibility of pluggable Writers (DIH writing to something other than Solr).
  (James Dyer, Noble Paul)


Optimizations
----------------------
* SOLR-1931: Speedup for LukeRequestHandler and admin/schema browser. New parameter
  reportDocCount defaults to 'false'. Old behavior still possible by specifying this as 'true'
  (Erick Erickson)

* SOLR-3012: Move System.getProperty("type") in postData() to main() and add type argument so that
  the client applications of SimplePostTool can set content type via method argument. (koji)

* SOLR-2888: FSTSuggester refactoring: internal storage is now UTF-8,
  external sorting (on disk) prevents OOMs even with large data sets
  (the bottleneck is now FST construction), code cleanups and API cleanups.
  (Dawid Weiss, Robert Muir)

Bug Fixes
----------------------
* SOLR-3187 SystemInfoHandler leaks filehandles (siren)

* LUCENE-3820: Fixed invalid position indexes by reimplementing PatternReplaceCharFilter.
  This change also drops real support for boundary characters -- all input is prebuffered
  for pattern matching. (Dawid Weiss)

* SOLR-3068: Fixed NPE in ThreadDumpHandler (siren)

* SOLR-2912: Fixed File descriptor leak in ShowFileRequestHandler (Michael Ryan, shalin)

* SOLR-2819: Improved speed of parsing hex entities in HTMLStripCharFilter
  (Bernhard Berger, hossman)

* SOLR-2509: StringIndexOutOfBoundsException in the spellchecker collate when the term contains
  a hyphen. (Thomas Gambier caught the bug, Steffen Godskesen did the patch, via Erick Erickson)

* SOLR-2955: Fixed IllegalStateException when querying with group.sort=score desc in sharded
             environment. (Steffen Elberg Godskesen, Martijn van Groningen)

* SOLR-2956: Fixed inconsistencies in the flags (and flag key) reported by
  the LukeRequestHandler (hossman)

* SOLR-1730: Made it clearer when a core failed to load as well as better logging when the
  QueryElevationComponent fails to properly initialize (gsingers)

* SOLR-1520: QueryElevationComponent now supports non-string ids (gsingers)

* SOLR-3024: Fixed JSONTestUtil.matchObj, in previous releases it was not
  respecting the 'delta' arg (David Smiley via hossman)

* SOLR-2542: Fixed DIH Context variables which were broken for all scopes other
  then SCOPE_ENTITY (Linbin Chen & Frank Wesemann via hossman)

* SOLR-3042: Fixed Maven Jetty plugin configuration.
  (David Smiley via Steve Rowe)

* SOLR-2970: CSV ResponseWriter returns fields defined as stored=false in schema (janhoy)

* LUCENE-3690, LUCENE-2208, SOLR-882, SOLR-42: Re-implemented
  HTMLStripCharFilter as a JFlex-generated scanner and moved it to
  lucene/contrib/analyzers/common/.  See below for a list of bug fixes and
  other changes.  To get the same behavior as HTMLStripCharFilter in Solr
  version 3.5 and earlier (including the bugs), use LegacyHTMLStripCharFilter,
  which is the previous implementation.

  Behavior changes from the previous version:

  - Known offset bugs are fixed.
  - The "Mark invalid" exceptions reported in SOLR-1283 are no longer
    triggered (the bug is still present in LegacyHTMLStripCharFilter).
  - The character entity "&apos;" is now always properly decoded.
  - More cases of <script> tags are now properly stripped.
  - CDATA sections are now handled properly.
  - Valid tag name characters now include the supplementary Unicode characters
    from Unicode character classes [:ID_Start:] and [:ID_Continue:].
  - Uppercase character entities "&QUOT;", "&COPY;", "&GT;", "&LT;", "&REG;",
    and "&AMP;" are now recognized and handled as if they were in lowercase.
  - The REPLACEMENT CHARACTER U+FFFD is now used to replace numeric character
    entities for unpaired UTF-16 low and high surrogates (in the range
    [U+D800-U+DFFF]).
  - Properly paired numeric character entities for UTF-16 surrogates are now
    converted to the corresponding code units.
  - Opening tags with unbalanced quotation marks are now properly stripped.
  - Literal "<" and ">" characters in opening tags, regardless of whether they
    appear inside quotation marks, now inhibit recognition (and stripping) of
    the tags.  The only exception to this is for values of event-handler
    attributes, e.g. "onClick", "onLoad", "onSelect".
  - A newline '\n' is substituted instead of a space for stripped HTML markup.
  - Nothing is substituted for opening and closing inline tags - they are
    simply removed.  The list of inline tags is (case insensitively): <a>,
    <abbr>, <acronym>, <b>, <basefont>, <bdo>, <big>, <cite>, <code>, <dfn>,
    <em>, <font>, <i>, <img>, <input>, <kbd>, <label>, <q>, <s>, <samp>,
    <select>, <small>, <span>, <strike>, <strong>, <sub>, <sup>, <textarea>,
    <tt>, <u>, and <var>.
  - HTMLStripCharFilterFactory now handles HTMLStripCharFilter's "escapedTags"
    feature: opening and closing tags with the given names, including any
    attributes and their values, are left intact in the output.
  (Steve Rowe)

* LUCENE-3717: Fixed offset bugs in TrimFilter, WordDelimiterFilter, and
  HyphenatedWordsFilter where they would create invalid offsets in
  some situations, leading to problems in highlighting.  (Robert Muir)

* SOLR-2280: commitWithin ignored for a delete query (Juan Grande via janhoy)

* SOLR-3073: Fixed 'Invalid UUID string' error when having an UUID field as
  the unique key and executing a distributed grouping request. (Devon Krisman, Martijn van Groningen)

* SOLR-3084: Fixed initialization error when using
  <queryResponseWriter default="true" ... /> (Bernd Fehling and hossman)

* SOLR-3109: Fixed numerous redundant shard requests when using distributed grouping.
  (rblack via Martijn van Groningen)

* SOLR-3052: Fixed typo in distributed grouping parameters.
  (Martijn van Groningen, Grant Ingersoll)

* SOLR-2909: Add support for ResourceLoaderAware tokenizerFactories in synonym
  filter factories. (Tom Klonikowski, Jun Ohtani via Koji Sekiguchi)

* SOLR-3168: ReplicationHandler "numberToKeep" & "maxNumberOfBackups" parameters
  would keep only 1 backup, even if more than 1 was specified (Neil Hooey, James Dyer)

* SOLR-3009: hitGrouped.vm isn't shipped with 3.x (ehatcher, janhoy)

* SOLR-3195: timeAllowed is ignored for grouping queries
  (Russell Black via Martijn van Groningen)

* SOLR-2124: Do not log stack traces for "Service Disabled" / 503 Exceptions (PingRequestHandler, etc)
  (James Dyer, others)

* SOLR-3260: DataImportHandler: ScriptTransformer gives better error messages when
  problems arise on initialization (no Script Engine, invalid script, etc). (James Dyer)

* SOLR-2959: edismax now respects the magic fields '_val_' and '_query_'
  (Michael Watts, hossman)

* SOLR-3074: fix SolrPluginUtils.docListToSolrDocumentList to respect the
  list of fields specified.  This fix also deprecates
  DocumentBuilder.loadStoredFields which is not used anywhere in Solr,
  and was fundamentally broken/bizarre.
  (hossman, Ahmet Arslan)

* SOLR-2291: fix JSONWriter to respect field list when writing SolrDocuments
  (Ahmet Arslan via hossman)

* SOLR-3264: Fix CoreContainer and SolrResourceLoader logging to be more
  clear about when SolrCores are being created, and stop misleading people
  about SolrCore instanceDir's being the "Solr Home Dir" (hossman)

* SOLR-3046: Fix whitespace typo in DIH response "Time taken" (hossman)

* SOLR-3261: Fix edismax to respect query operators when literal colons
  are used in query string.  (Juan Grande via hossman)

* SOLR-3226: Fix SignatureUpdateProcessor to no longer ignore non-String
  field values (Spyros Kapnissis, hossman)

* SOLR-3200: Fix SignatureUpdateProcessor "all fields" mode to use all
  fields of each document instead of the fields specified by the first
  document indexed (Spyros Kapnissis via hossman)

* SOLR-3316: Distributed grouping failed when rows parameter was set to 0 and
  sometimes returned a wrong hit count as matches. (Cody Young, Martijn van Groningen)

* SOLR-3107: contrib/langid: When using the LangDetect implementation of
  langid, set the random seed to 0, so that the same document is detected as
  the same language with the same probability every time.
  (Christian Moen via rmuir)

* SOLR-2937: Configuring the number of contextual snippets used for
  search results clustering. The hl.snippets parameter is now respected
  by the clustering plugin, can be overridden by carrot.summarySnippets
  if needed (Stanislaw Osinski).

* SOLR-2938: Clustering on multiple fields. The carrot.title and
  carrot.snippet can now take comma- or space-separated lists of
  field names to cluster (Stanislaw Osinski).

* SOLR-2939: Clustering of multilingual search results. The document's
  language field be passed in the carrot.lang parameter, the carrot.lcmap
  parameter enables mapping of language codes to ISO 639 (Stanislaw Osinski).

* SOLR-2940: Passing values for custom Carrot2 fields to Clustering component.
  The custom field mapping are defined using the carrot.custom parameter
  (Stanislaw Osinski).

* SOLR-2941: NullPointerException on clustering component initialization
  when schema does not have a unique key field (Stanislaw Osinski).

* SOLR-2942: ClassCastException when passing non-textual fields to
  clustering component (Stanislaw Osinski).


Other Changes
----------------------
* SOLR-2922: Upgrade commons-io and commons-lang to 2.1 and 2.6, respectively. (koji)

* SOLR-2920: Refactor frequent conditional use of DefaultSolrParams and
  AppendedSolrParams into factory methods.
  (David Smiley via hossman)

* SOLR-3032: Deprecate logOnce from SolrException logOnce and all the supporting
  structure will disappear in 4.0. Errors should be caught and logged at the
  top-most level or logged and NOT propagated up the chain. (Erick Erickson)

* SOLR-2718: Add ability to lazy load response writers, defined with startup="lazy".
  (ehatcher)

* SOLR-2901: Upgrade Solr to Tika 1.0 (janhoy)

* SOLR-3059: Example XSL stylesheet for indexing query result XML (janhoy)

* SOLR-3097, SOLR-3105: Add analysis configurations for different languages to
  the example.  (Christian Moen, Robert Muir)

* SOLR-3005: Default QueryResponseWriters are now initialized via init() with an empty
  NamedList. (Gasol Wu, Chris Male)

* SOLR-3140: Upgrade schema version to 1.5, where omitNorms defaults to "true" for all
  primitive (non-analyzed) field types such as int, float, date, bool, string.. (janhoy)

* SOLR-3077: Better error messages when attempting to use "blank" field names
  (Antony Stubbs via hossman)

* SOLR-2712: expecting fl=score to return all fields is now deprecated.
  In solr 4.0, this will only return the score.  (ryan)

* SOLR-3156: Check for Lucene directory locks at startup. In previous versions
  this check was only performed during modifying (e.g. adding and deleting
  documents) the index. (Luca Cavanna via Martijn van Groningen)

* SOLR-1052: Deprecated <indexDefaults> and <mainIndex> in solrconfig.xml
  From now, all settings go in the new <indexConfig> tag, and some defaults are
  changed: useCompoundFile=false, ramBufferSizeMB=32, lockType=native, so that
  the effect of NOT specifying <indexConfig> at all gives same result as the
  example config used to give in 3.5 (janhoy, gsingers)

* SOLR-3294: In contrib/clustering/lib/, replaced the manually retrowoven
  Java 1.5-compatible carrot2-core-3.5.0.jar (which is not publicly available,
  except from the Solr Subversion repository), with newly released Java
  1.5-compatible carrot2-core-3.5.0.1.jar (hosted on the Maven Central
  repository).  Also updated dependencies jackson-core-asl and
  jackson-mapper-asl (both v1.5.2 -> v1.7.4).  (Dawid Weiss, Steve Rowe)

* SOLR-3295: netcdf jar is excluded from the binary release (and disabled in
  ivy.xml) because it requires java 6. If you want to parse this content with
  extracting request handler and are willing to use java 6, just add the jar.
  (rmuir)

* SOLR-3142: DIH Imports no longer default optimize to true, instead false.
  If you want to force all segments to be merged into one, you can specify
  this parameter yourself. NOTE: this can be very expensive operation and
  usually does not make sense for delta-imports.  (Robert Muir)

Build
----------------------
* SOLR-2487: Add build target to package war without slf4j jars (janhoy)

* SOLR-3112: Fix tests not to write to src/test-files (Luca Cavanna via Robert Muir)

* LUCENE-3753: Restructure the Solr build system. (Steve Rowe)

* SOLR-3204: The packaged pre-release artifact of Commons CSV used the original
  package name (org.apache.commons.csv). This created a compatibility issue as
  the Apache Commons team works toward an official release of Commons CSV.
  The source of Commons CSV was added under a separate package name to the
  Solr source code.  (Uwe Schindler, Chris Male, Emmanuel Bourg)

* LUCENE-3930: Changed build system to use Apache Ivy for retrival of 3rd
  party JAR files.  Please review README.txt for instructions.
  (Robert Muir, Chris Male, Uwe Schindler, Steven Rowe, Hossman)

==================  3.5.0  ==================

New Features
----------------------

  Update Processor, using Tika's LanguageIdentifier or Cybozu language-detection
  library (janhoy, Tommaso Teofili, gsingers)

* SOLR-2818: Added before/after count response parsing support for range facets in
  SolrJ. (Bernhard Frauendienst via Martijn van Groningen)

  (Chris Male, Mark Holland, Gunnlaugur Thor Briem, Ryan McKinley)

* SOLR-2578: ReplicationHandler's backup command now supports a 'numberToKeep'
  request param that can be used to delete all but the most recent N backups.
  (James Dyer via hossman)

* SOLR-2839: Add alternative implementation to contrib/langid supporting 53
  languages, based on http://code.google.com/p/language-detection/ (rmuir)

Optimizations
----------------------

* SOLR-2742: SolrJ: Provide commitWithinMs as optional parameter for all add() methods,
  making the feature more conveniently accessible for developers (janhoy)

Bug Fixes
----------------------
* SOLR-2748: The CommitTracker used for commitWith or autoCommit by maxTime
  could commit too frequently and could block adds until a new searcher was
  registered. (yonik)

* SOLR-2726: Fixed NullPointerException when using spellcheck.q with Suggester.
  (Bernd Fehling, valentin via rmuir)

* SOLR-2772: Fixed Date parsing/formatting of years 0001-1000 (hossman)

* SOLR-2763: Extracting update request handler throws exception and returns 400
  when zero-length file posted using multipart form post (janhoy)

* SOLR-2780: Fixed issue where multi select facets didn't respect group.truncate parameter.
  (Martijn van Groningen, Ramzi Alqrainy)

* SOLR-2793: In rare cases (most likely during shutdown), a SolrIndexSearcher can be left
  open if the executor rejects a task. (Mark Miller)

* SOLR-2791: Replication: abortfetch command is broken if replication was started
  by fetchindex command instead of a regular poll (Yury Kats via shalin)

* SOLR-2861: Fix extremely rare race condition on commit that can result
  in a NPE (yonik)

* SOLR-2813: Fix HTTP error codes returned when requests contain strings that
  can not be parsed as numbers for Trie fields. (Jeff Crump and hossman)

* SOLR-2902: List of collations are wrong parsed in SpellCheckResponse causing
  a wrong number of collation results in the response.
  (Bastiaan Verhoef, James Dyer via Simon Willnauer)

* SOLR-2875: Fix the incorrect url in DIH example tika-data-config.xml
  (Shinichiro Abe via koji)

Other Changes
----------------------

* SOLR-2750: Make both "update.chain" and the deprecated "update.param" work
  consistently everywhere; see also SOLR-2105. (Mark Miller, janhoy)

* LUCENE-3410: Deprecated the WordDelimiterFilter constructors accepting multiple
  ints masquerading as booleans.  Preferred constructor now accepts a single int
  bitfield (Chris Male)

* SOLR-2758: Moved ConcurrentLRUCache from o.a.s.common.util package in the solrj
  module to the o.a.s.util package in the Solr core module.
  (David Smiley via Steve Rowe)

* SOLR-2766: Package individual javadoc sites for solrj and test-framework.
  (Steve Rowe, Mike McCandless)

* SOLR-2771: Solr modules' tests should not depend on solr-core test classes;
  move BufferingRequestProcessor from solr-core tests to test-framework so that
  the Solr Cell module can use it. (janhoy, Steve Rowe)

* LUCENE-3457: Upgrade commons-compress to 1.2 (Doron Cohen)

* SOLR-2757: min() and max() functions now support an arbitrary number of
  ValueSources  (Bill Bell via hossman)

* SOLR-2591: Remove commitLockTimeout option from solrconfig.xml (Luca Cavanna via Martijn van Groningen)

* SOLR-2746: Upgraded UIMA dependencies from *-2.3.1-SNAPSHOT.jar to *-2.3.1.jar.


==================  3.4.0  ==================

Upgrading from Solr 3.3
----------------------

* The Lucene index format has changed and as a result, once you upgrade,
  previous versions of Solr will no longer be able to read your indices.
  In a master/slave configuration, all searchers/slaves should be upgraded
  before the master.  If the master were to be updated first, the older
  searchers would not be able to read the new index format.

* Previous versions of Solr silently allow and ignore some contradictory
  properties specified in schema.xml.  For example:
    - indexed="false" omitNorms="false"
    - indexed="false" omitTermFreqAndPositions="false"
  Field property validation has now been fixed, to ensure that
  contradictions like these now generate error messages.  If users
  have existing schemas that generate one of these new "conflicting
  'false' field options for non-indexed field" error messages the
  conflicting "omit*" properties can safely be removed, or changed to
  "true" for consistent behavior with previous Solr versions.  This
  situation has now been fixed to cause an error on startup when these
  contradictory options.  See SOLR-2669.

* FacetComponent no longer catches and embeds exceptions occurred during facet
  processing, it throws HTTP 400 or 500 exceptions instead.

New Features
----------------------

* SOLR-2540: CommitWithin as an Update Request parameter
  You can now specify &commitWithin=N (ms) on the update request (janhoy)

* SOLR-2458: post.jar enhanced to handle JSON, CSV and <optimize> (janhoy)

* LUCENE-3234: add a new parameter hl.phraseLimit for FastVectorHighlighter speed up.
  (Mike Sokolov via koji)

* SOLR-2429: Ability to add cache=false to queries and query filters to avoid
  using the filterCache or queryCache.  A cost may also be specified and is used
  to order the evaluation of non-cached filters from least to greatest cost .
  For very expensive query filters (cost >= 100) if the query implements
  the PostFilter interface, it will be used to obtain a Collector that is
  checked only for documents that match the main query and all other filters.
  The "frange" query now implements the PostFilter interface.  (yonik)

* SOLR-2630: Added new XsltUpdateRequestHandler that works like
  XmlUpdateRequestHandler but allows to transform the POSTed XML document
  using XSLT. This allows to POST arbitrary XML documents to the update
  handler, as long as you also provide a XSL to transform them to a valid
  Solr input document.  (Upayavira, Uwe Schindler)

* SOLR-2615: Log individual updates (adds and deletes) at the FINE level
  before adding to the index.  Fix a null pointer exception in logging
  when there was no unique key. (David Smiley via yonik)

* LUCENE-2048: Added omitPositions to the schema, so you can omit position
  information while still indexing term frequencies.  (rmuir)

* SOLR-2584: add UniqFieldsUpdateProcessor that removes duplicate values in the
  specified fields. (Elmer Garduno, koji)

* SOLR-2670: Added NIOFSDirectoryFactory (yonik)

* SOLR-2523: Added support in SolrJ to easily interact with range facets.
  The range facet response can be parsed and is retrievable from the
  QueryResponse class. The SolrQuery class has convenient methods for using
  range facets. (Martijn van Groningen)

* SOLR-2637: Added support for group result parsing in SolrJ.
  (Tao Cheng, Martijn van Groningen)

* SOLR-2665: Added post group faceting. Facet counts are based on the most
  relevant document of each group matching the query. This feature has the
  same impact on the StatsComponent. (Martijn van Groningen)

* SOLR-2675: CoreAdminHandler now allows arbitrary properties to be
  specified when CREATEing a new SolrCore using property.* request
  params.  (Yury Kats, hossman)

* SOLR-2714: JSON update format - "null" field values are now dropped
  instead of causing an exception. (Trygve Laugstøl, yonik)


Optimizations
----------------------

* LUCENE-3233: Improved memory usage, build time, and performance of
  SynonymFilterFactory.  (Mike McCandless, Robert Muir)

Bug Fixes
----------------------

* SOLR-2625: TermVectorComponent throws NPE if TF-IDF option is used without DF
  option. (Daniel Erenrich, Simon Willnauer)

* SOLR-2631: PingRequestHandler should not allow to ping itself using "qt"
  param to prevent infinite loop. (Edoardo Tosca, Uwe Schindler)

* SOLR-2636: Fix explain functionality for negative queries. (Tom Hill via yonik)

* SOLR-2538: Range Faceting on long/double fields could overflow if values
  bigger then the max int/float were used.
  (Erbi Hanka, hossman)

* SOLR-2230: CommonsHttpSolrServer.addFile could not be used to send
  multiple files in a single request.
  (Stephan Günther, hossman)

* SOLR-2541: PluginInfos was not correctly parsing <long/> tags when
  initializing plugins
  (Frank Wesemann, hossman)

* SOLR-2623: Solr JMX MBeans do not survive core reloads (Alexey Serba, shalin)

* Fixed grouping bug when start is bigger than rows and format is simple that zero documents are returned even
  if there are documents to display. (Martijn van Groningen, Nikhil Chhaochharia)

* SOLR-2564: Fixed ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException when using simple format and
  start > 0 (Martijn van Groningen, Matteo Melli)

* SOLR-2642: Fixed sorting by function when using grouping. (Thomas Heigl, Martijn van Groningen)

* SOLR-2535: REGRESSION: in Solr 3.x and trunk the admin/file handler
  fails to show directory listings (David Smiley, Peter Wolanin via Erick Erickson)

* SOLR-2545: ExternalFileField file parsing would fail if any key
  contained an "=" character.  It now only looks for the last "=" delimiter
  prior to the float value.
  (Markus Jelsma, hossman)

* SOLR-2662: When Solr is configured to have no queryResultCache, the
  "start" parameter was not honored and the documents returned were
   0 through start+offset.  (Markus Jelsma, yonik)

* SOLR-2669: Fix backwards validation of field properties in
  SchemaField.calcProps (hossman)

* SOLR-2676: Add "welcome-file-list" to solr.war so admin UI works correctly
  in servlet containers such as WebSphere that do not use a default list
  (Jay R. Jaeger, hossman)

* SOLR-2606: Fixed sort parsing of fields containing punctuation that
  failed due to sort by function changes introduced in SOLR-1297
  (Mitsu Hadeishi, hossman)

* SOLR-2706: contrib/clustering: The carrot.lexicalResourcesDir parameter
  now works with absolute directories (Stanislaw Osinski)

* SOLR-2692: contrib/clustering: Typo in param name fixed: "carrot.fragzise"
  changed to "carrot.fragSize" (Stanislaw Osinski).

* SOLR-2644: When using DIH with threads=2 the default logging is set too high
  (Bill Bell via shalin)

* SOLR-2492: DIH does not commit if only deletes are processed
  (James Dyer via shalin)

* SOLR-2186: DataImportHandler's multi-threaded option throws NPE
  (Lance Norskog, Frank Wesemann, shalin)

* SOLR-2655: DIH multi threaded mode does not resolve attributes correctly
  (Frank Wesemann, shalin)

* SOLR-2695: DIH: Documents are collected in unsynchronized list in
  multi-threaded debug mode (Michael McCandless, shalin)

* SOLR-2668: DIH multithreaded mode does not rollback on errors from
  EntityProcessor (Frank Wesemann, shalin)

Other Changes
----------------------

* SOLR-2629: Eliminate deprecation warnings in some JSPs.
  (Bernd Fehling, hossman)

* SOLR-2743: Remove commons logging from contrib/extraction. (koji)


Build
----------------------

* SOLR-2452,SOLR-2653,LUCENE-3323,SOLR-2659,LUCENE-3329,SOLR-2666:
  Rewrote the Solr build system:
  - Integrated more fully with the Lucene build system: generalized the
    Lucene build system and eliminated duplication.
  - Converted all Solr contribs to the Lucene/Solr conventional src/ layout:
    java/, resources/, test/, and test-files/<contrib-name>.
  - Created a new Solr-internal module named "core" by moving the java/,
    test/, and test-files/ directories from solr/src/ to solr/core/src/.
  - Merged solr/src/webapp/src/ into solr/core/src/java/.
  - Eliminated solr/src/ by moving all its directories up one level;
    renamed solr/src/site/ to solr/site-src/ because solr/site/ already
    exists.
  - Merged solr/src/common/ into solr/solrj/src/java/.
  - Moved o.a.s.client.solrj.* and o.a.s.common.* tests from
    solr/src/test/ to solr/solrj/src/test/.
  - Made the solrj tests not depend on the solr core tests by moving
    some classes from solr/src/test/ to solr/test-framework/src/java/.
  - Each internal module (core/, solrj/, test-framework/, and webapp/)
    now has its own build.xml, from which it is possible to run
    module-specific targets.  solr/build.xml delegates all build
    tasks (via <ant dir="internal-module-dir"> calls) to these
    modules' build.xml files.
  (Steve Rowe, Robert Muir)

* LUCENE-3406: Add ant target 'package-local-src-tgz' to Lucene and Solr
  to package sources from the local working copy.
  (Seung-Yeoul Yang via Steve Rowe)

Documentation
----------------------

==================  3.3.0  ==================

Upgrading from Solr 3.2.0
----------------------
 * SolrCore's CloseHook API has been changed in a backward-incompatible way. It
   has been changed from an interface to an abstract class. Any custom
   components which use the SolrCore.addCloseHook method will need to
   be modified accordingly. To migrate, put your old CloseHook#close impl into
   CloseHook#preClose.

New Features
----------------------

* SOLR-2378: A new, automaton-based, implementation of suggest (autocomplete)
  component, offering an order of magnitude smaller memory consumption
  compared to ternary trees and jaspell and very fast lookups at runtime.
  (Dawid Weiss)

* SOLR-2400: Field- and DocumentAnalysisRequestHandler now provide a position
  history for each token, so you can follow the token through all analysis stages.
  The output contains a separate int[] attribute containing all positions from
  previous Tokenizers/TokenFilters (called "positionHistory").
  (Uwe Schindler)

* SOLR-2524: (SOLR-236, SOLR-237, SOLR-1773, SOLR-1311) Grouping / Field collapsing
  using the Lucene grouping contrib. The search result can be grouped by field and query.
  (Martijn van Groningen, Emmanuel Keller, Shalin Shekhar Mangar, Koji Sekiguchi,
   Iván de Prado, Ryan McKinley, Marc Sturlese, Peter Karich, Bojan Smid,
   Charles Hornberger, Dieter Grad, Dmitry Lihachev, Doug Steigerwald,
   Karsten Sperling, Michael Gundlach, Oleg Gnatovskiy, Thomas Traeger,
   Harish Agarwal, yonik, Michael McCandless, Bill Bell)

* SOLR-1331 -- Added a srcCore parameter to CoreAdminHandler's mergeindexes action
  to merge one or more cores' indexes to a target core (shalin)

* SOLR-2610 -- Add an option to delete index through CoreAdmin UNLOAD action (shalin)

* SOLR-2480: Add ignoreTikaException flag to the extraction request handler so
  that users can ignore TikaException but index meta data.
  (Shinichiro Abe, koji)

* SOLR-2582: Use uniqueKey for error log in UIMAUpdateRequestProcessor.
  (Tommaso Teofili via koji)

Optimizations
----------------------

* SOLR-2567: Solr now defaults to TieredMergePolicy. See http://s.apache.org/merging
  for more information.  (rmuir)

Bug Fixes
----------------------

* SOLR-2519: Improve text_* fieldTypes in example schema.xml: improve
  cross-language defaults for text_general; break out separate
  English-specific fieldTypes (Jan Høydahl, hossman, Robert Muir,
  yonik, Mike McCandless)

* SOLR-2462: Fix extremely high memory usage problems with spellcheck.collate.
  Separately, an additional spellcheck.maxCollationEvaluations (default=10000)
  parameter is added to avoid excessive CPU time in extreme cases (e.g. long
  queries with many misspelled words).  (James Dyer via rmuir)

* SOLR-2579: UIMAUpdateRequestProcessor ignore error fails if text.length() < 100.
  (Elmer Garduno via koji)

* SOLR-2581: UIMAToSolrMapper wrongly instantiates Type with reflection.
  (Tommaso Teofili via koji)

* SOLR-2551: Check dataimport.properties for write access (if delta-import is
  supported in DIH configuration) before starting an import (C S, shalin)

Other Changes
----------------------

* SOLR-2571: Add a commented out example of the spellchecker's thresholdTokenFrequency
  parameter to the example solrconfig.xml, and also add a unit test for this feature.
  (James Dyer via rmuir)

* SOLR-2576: Deprecate SpellingResult.add(Token token, int docFreq), please use
  SpellingResult.addFrequency(Token token, int docFreq) instead.
  (James Dyer via rmuir)

* SOLR-2574: Upgrade slf4j to v1.6.1 (shalin)

* LUCENE-3204: The maven-ant-tasks jar is now included in the source tree;
  users of the generate-maven-artifacts target no longer have to manually
  place this jar in the Ant classpath.  NOTE: when Ant looks for the
  maven-ant-tasks jar, it looks first in its pre-existing classpath, so
  any copies it finds will be used instead of the copy included in the
  Lucene/Solr source tree.  For this reason, it is recommeded to remove
  any copies of the maven-ant-tasks jar in the Ant classpath, e.g. under
  ~/.ant/lib/ or under the Ant installation's lib/ directory. (Steve Rowe)

* SOLR-2611: Fix typos in the example configuration (Eric Pugh via rmuir)

==================  3.2.0  ==================
Versions of Major Components
---------------------
Apache Lucene trunk
Apache Tika 0.8
Carrot2 3.4.2


Upgrading from Solr 3.1
----------------------

* The updateRequestProcessorChain for a RequestHandler is now defined
  with update.chain rather than update.processor. The latter still works,
  but has been deprecated.

* <uimaConfig/> just beneath <config> ... </config> is no longer supported.
  It should move to UIMAUpdateRequestProcessorFactory setting.
  See contrib/uima/README.txt for more details. (SOLR-2436)

Detailed Change List
----------------------

New Features
----------------------

* SOLR-2496: Add ability to specify overwrite and commitWithin as request
  parameters (e.g. specified in the URL) when using the JSON update format,
  and added a simplified format for specifying multiple documents.
  Example: [{"id":"doc1"},{"id":"doc2"}]
  (yonik)

* SOLR-2113: Add TermQParserPlugin, registered as "term".  This is useful
  when generating filter queries from terms returned from field faceting or
  the terms component. Example: fq={!term f=weight}1.5   (hossman, yonik)

* SOLR-1915: DebugComponent now supports using a NamedList to model
  Explanation objects in its responses instead of
  Explanation.toString  (hossman)

* SOLR-2448: Search results clustering updates: bisecting k-means
  clustering algorithm added, loading of Carrot2 stop words from
  <solr.home>/conf/carrot2 (SOLR-2449), using Solr's stopwords.txt
  for clustering (SOLR-2450), output of cluster scores (SOLR-2505)
  (Stanislaw Osinski, Dawid Weiss).

* SOLR-2503: extend UIMAUpdateRequestProcessorFactory mapping function to
  map feature value to dynamicField. (koji)

* SOLR-2512: add ignoreErrors flag to UIMAUpdateRequestProcessorFactory so
  that users can ignore exceptions in AE. (Tommaso Teofili, koji)

Optimizations
----------------------

Bug Fixes
----------------------

* SOLR-2445: Change the default qt to blank in form.jsp, because there is no "standard"
  request handler unless you have it in your solrconfig.xml explicitly. (koji)

* SOLR-2455: Prevent double submit of forms in admin interface.
  (Jeffrey Chang via uschindler)

* SOLR-2464: Fix potential slowness in QueryValueSource (the query() function) when
  the query is very sparse and may not match any documents in a segment. (yonik)

* SOLR-2469: When using java replication with replicateAfter=startup, the first
  commit point on server startup is never removed. (yonik)

* SOLR-2466: SolrJ's CommonsHttpSolrServer would retry requests on failure, regardless
  of the configured maxRetries, due to HttpClient having its own retry mechanism
  by default.  The retryCount of HttpClient is now set to 0, and SolrJ does
  the retry.  (yonik)

* SOLR-2409: edismax parser - treat the text of a fielded query as a literal if the
  fieldname does not exist.  For example Mission: Impossible should not search on
  the "Mission" field unless it's a valid field in the schema.  (Ryan McKinley, yonik)

* SOLR-2403: facet.sort=index reported incorrect results for distributed search
  in a number of scenarios when facet.mincount>0.  This patch also adds some
  performance/algorithmic improvements when (facet.sort=count && facet.mincount=1
  && facet.limit=-1) and when (facet.sort=index && facet.mincount>0)  (yonik)

* SOLR-2333: The "rename" core admin action does not persist the new name to solr.xml
  (Rasmus Hahn, Paul R. Brown via Mark Miller)

* SOLR-2390: Performance of usePhraseHighlighter is terrible on very large Documents,
  regardless of hl.maxDocCharsToAnalyze. (Mark Miller)

* SOLR-2474: The helper TokenStreams in analysis.jsp and AnalysisRequestHandlerBase
  did not clear all attributes so they displayed incorrect attribute values for tokens
  in later filter stages. (uschindler, rmuir, yonik)

* SOLR-2467: Fix <analyzer class="..." /> initialization so any errors
  are logged properly.  (hossman)

* SOLR-2493: SolrQueryParser was fixed to not parse the SolrConfig DOM tree on each
  instantiation which is a huge slowdown.  (Stephane Bailliez via uschindler)

* SOLR-2495: The JSON parser could hang on corrupted input and could fail
  to detect numbers that were too large to fit in a long.  (yonik)

* SOLR-2520: Make JSON response format escape \u2029 as well as \u2028
  in strings since those characters are not valid in javascript strings
  (although they are valid in JSON strings).  (yonik)

* SOLR-2536: Add ReloadCacheRequestHandler to fix ExternalFileField bug (if reopenReaders
  set to true and no index segments have been changed, commit cannot trigger reload
  external file). (koji)

* SOLR-2539: VectorValueSource.floatVal incorrectly used byteVal on sub-sources.
  (Tom Liu via yonik)

* SOLR-2554: RandomSortField didn't work when used in a function query. (yonik)


Other Changes
----------------------

* SOLR-2061: Pull base tests out into a new Solr Test Framework module,
  and publish binary, javadoc, and source test-framework jars.
  (Drew Farris, Robert Muir, Steve Rowe)

* SOLR-2105: Rename RequestHandler param 'update.processor' to 'update.chain'.
  (Jan Høydahl via Mark Miller)

* SOLR-2485: Deprecate BaseResponseWriter, GenericBinaryResponseWriter, and
  GenericTextResponseWriter.  These classes will be removed in 4.0.  (ryan)

* SOLR-2451: Enhance assertJQ to allow individual tests to specify the
  tolerance delta used in numeric equalities.  This allows for slight
  variance in asserting score comparisons in unit tests.
  (David Smiley, Chris Hostetter)

* SOLR-2528: Remove default="true" from HtmlEncoder in example solrconfig.xml,
  because html encoding confuses non-ascii users. (koji)

* SOLR-2387: add mock annotators for improved testing in contrib/uima,
  (Tommaso Teofili via rmuir)

* SOLR-2436: move uimaConfig to under the uima's update processor in
  solrconfig.xml.  (Tommaso Teofili, koji)

Build
----------------------

* LUCENE-3006: Building javadocs will fail on warnings by default.  Override with -Dfailonjavadocwarning=false (sarowe, gsingers)


Documentation
----------------------


==================  3.1.0 ==================
Versions of Major Components
---------------------
Apache Lucene 3.1.0
Apache Tika 0.8
Carrot2 3.4.2
Velocity 1.6.1 and Velocity Tools 2.0-beta3
Apache UIMA 2.3.1-SNAPSHOT


Upgrading from Solr 1.4
----------------------

* The Lucene index format has changed and as a result, once you upgrade,
  previous versions of Solr will no longer be able to read your indices.
  In a master/slave configuration, all searchers/slaves should be upgraded
  before the master.  If the master were to be updated first, the older
  searchers would not be able to read the new index format.

* The Solr JavaBin format has changed as of Solr 3.1. If you are using the
  JavaBin format, you will need to upgrade your SolrJ client. (SOLR-2034)

* The experimental ALIAS command has been removed (SOLR-1637)

* Using solr.xml is recommended for single cores also (SOLR-1621)

* Old syntax of <highlighting> configuration in solrconfig.xml
  is deprecated (SOLR-1696)

* The deprecated HTMLStripReader, HTMLStripWhitespaceTokenizerFactory and
  HTMLStripStandardTokenizerFactory were removed. To strip HTML tags,
  HTMLStripCharFilter should be used instead, and it works with any
  Tokenizer of your choice.  (SOLR-1657)

* Field compression is no longer supported. Fields that were formerly
  compressed will be uncompressed as index segments are merged. For
  shorter fields, this may actually be an improvement, as the compression
  used was not very good for short text. Some indexes may get larger though.

* SOLR-1845: The TermsComponent response format was changed so that the
  "terms" container is a map instead of a named list.  This affects
   response formats like JSON, but not XML. (yonik)

* SOLR-1876: All Analyzers and TokenStreams are now final to enforce
  the decorator pattern.  (rmuir, uschindler)

* LUCENE-2608: Added the ability to specify the accuracy on a per request basis.
  It is recommended that implementations of SolrSpellChecker should change over to the new SolrSpellChecker
  methods using the new SpellingOptions class, but are not required to.  While this change is
  backward compatible, the trunk version of Solr has already dropped support for all but the SpellingOptions method. (gsingers)

* readercycle script was removed. (SOLR-2046)

* In previous releases, sorting or evaluating function queries on
  fields that were "multiValued" (either by explicit declaration in
  schema.xml or by implict behavior because the "version" attribute on
  the schema was less then 1.2) did not generally work, but it would
  sometimes silently act as if it succeeded and order the docs
  arbitrarily.  Solr will now fail on any attempt to sort, or apply a
  function to, multi-valued fields

* The DataImportHandler jars are no longer included in the solr
  WAR and should be added in Solr's lib directory, or referenced
  via the <lib> directive in solrconfig.xml.


Detailed Change List
----------------------

New Features
----------------------

* SOLR-1302: Added several new distance based functions, including
  Great Circle (haversine), Manhattan, Euclidean and String (using the
  StringDistance methods in the Lucene spellchecker).
  Also added geohash(), deg() and rad() convenience functions.
  See https://lucene.apache.org/solr/guide/function-queries.html (gsingers)

* SOLR-1553: New dismax parser implementation (accessible as "edismax")
  that supports full lucene syntax, improved reserved char escaping,
  fielded queries, improved proximity boosting, and improved stopword
  handling. Note: status is experimental for now. (yonik)

* SOLR-1574: Add many new functions from java Math (e.g. sin, cos) (yonik)

* SOLR-1569: Allow functions to take in literal strings by modifying the
  FunctionQParser and adding LiteralValueSource (gsingers)

* SOLR-1571: Added unicode collation support though Lucene's CollationKeyFilter
  (Robert Muir via shalin)

* SOLR-785: Distributed Search support for SpellCheckComponent
  (Matthew Woytowitz, shalin)

* SOLR-1625: Add regexp support for TermsComponent (Uri Boness via noble)

* SOLR-1297: Add sort by Function capability (gsingers, yonik)

* SOLR-1139: Add TermsComponent Query and Response Support in SolrJ (Matt Weber via shalin)

* SOLR-1177: Distributed Search support for TermsComponent (Matt Weber via shalin)

* SOLR-1621, SOLR-1722: Allow current single core deployments to be specified by solr.xml (Mark Miller , noble)

* SOLR-1532: Allow StreamingUpdateSolrServer to use a provided HttpClient (Gabriele Renzi via shalin)

* SOLR-1653: Add PatternReplaceCharFilter (koji)

* SOLR-1131: FieldTypes can now output multiple Fields per Type and still be searched.  This can be handy for hiding the details of a particular
  implementation such as in the spatial case. (Chris Mattmann, shalin, noble, gsingers, yonik)

* SOLR-1586: Add support for Geohash and Spatial Tile FieldType (Chris Mattmann, gsingers)

* SOLR-1697: PluginInfo should load plugins w/o class attribute also (noble)

* SOLR-1268: Incorporate FastVectorHighlighter (koji)

* SOLR-1750: SolrInfoMBeanHandler added for simpler programmatic access
  to info currently available from registry.jsp and stats.jsp
  (ehatcher, hossman)

* SOLR-1815: SolrJ now preserves the order of facet queries. (yonik)

* SOLR-1677: Add support for choosing the Lucene Version for Lucene components within
  Solr. (Uwe Schindler, Mark Miller)

* SOLR-1379: Add RAMDirectoryFactory for non-persistent in memory index storage.
  (Alex Baranov via yonik)

* SOLR-1857: Synced Solr analysis with Lucene 3.1. Added KeywordMarkerFilterFactory
  and StemmerOverrideFilterFactory, which can be used to tune stemming algorithms.
  Added factories for Bulgarian, Czech, Hindi, Turkish, and Wikipedia analysis. Improved the
  performance of SnowballPorterFilterFactory.  (rmuir)

* SOLR-1657: Converted remaining TokenStreams to the Attributes-based API. All Solr
  TokenFilters now support custom Attributes, and some have improved performance:
  especially WordDelimiterFilter and CommonGramsFilter.  (rmuir, cmale, uschindler)

* SOLR-1740: ShingleFilterFactory supports the "minShingleSize" and "tokenSeparator"
  parameters for controlling the minimum shingle size produced by the filter, and
  the separator string that it uses, respectively.  (Steven Rowe via rmuir)

* SOLR-744: ShingleFilterFactory supports the "outputUnigramsIfNoShingles"
  parameter, to output unigrams if the number of input tokens is fewer than
  minShingleSize, and no shingles can be generated.
  (Chris Harris via Steven Rowe)

* SOLR-1923: PhoneticFilterFactory now has support for the
  Caverphone algorithm. (rmuir)

* SOLR-1957: The VelocityResponseWriter contrib moved to core.
       Example search UI now available at http://localhost:8983/solr/browse
       (ehatcher)

* SOLR-1974: Add LimitTokenCountFilterFactory. (koji)

* SOLR-1966: QueryElevationComponent can now return just the included results in the elevation file (gsingers, yonik)

* SOLR-1556: TermVectorComponent now supports per field overrides.  Also, it now throws an error
 if passed in fields do not exist and warnings
  if fields that do not have term vector options (termVectors, offsets, positions)
   that align with the schema declaration. It also
    will now return warnings about (gsingers)

* SOLR-1985: FastVectorHighlighter: add wrapper class for Lucene's SingleFragListBuilder (koji)

* SOLR-1984: Add HyphenationCompoundWordTokenFilterFactory. (PB via rmuir)

* SOLR-397: Date Faceting now supports a "facet.date.include" param
  for specifying when the upper & lower end points of computed date
  ranges should be included in the range.  Legal values are: "all",
  "lower", "upper", "edge", and "outer".  For backwards compatibility
  the default value is the set: [lower,upper,edge], so that all ranges
  between start and end are inclusive of their endpoints, but the
  "before" and "after" ranges are not.

* SOLR-945: JSON update handler that accepts add, delete, commit
  commands in JSON format. (Ryan McKinley, yonik)

* SOLR-2015: Add a boolean attribute autoGeneratePhraseQueries to TextField.
  autoGeneratePhraseQueries="true" (the default) causes the query parser to
  generate phrase queries if multiple tokens are generated from a single
  non-quoted analysis string.  For example WordDelimiterFilter splitting text:pdp-11
  will cause the parser to generate text:"pdp 11" rather than (text:PDP OR text:11).
  Note that autoGeneratePhraseQueries="true" tends to not work well for non whitespace
  delimited languages. (yonik)

* SOLR-1925: Add CSVResponseWriter (use wt=csv) that returns the list of documents
  in CSV format. (Chris Mattmann, yonik)

* SOLR-1240: "Range Faceting" has been added.  This is a generalization
  of the existing "Date Faceting" logic so that it now supports any
  all stock numeric field types that support range queries in addition
  to dates. facet.date is now deprecated in favor of this generalized mechanism.
  (Gijs Kunze, hossman)

* SOLR-2021: Add SolrEncoder plugin to Highlighter. (koji)

* SOLR-2030: Make FastVectorHighlighter use of SolrEncoder. (koji)

* SOLR-2053: Add support for custom comparators in Solr spellchecker, per LUCENE-2479 (gsingers)

* SOLR-2049: Add hl.multiValuedSeparatorChar for FastVectorHighlighter, per LUCENE-2603. (koji)

* SOLR-2059: Add "types" attribute to WordDelimiterFilterFactory, which
  allows you to customize how WordDelimiterFilter tokenizes text with
  a configuration file.  (Peter Karich, rmuir)

* SOLR-2099: Add ability to throttle rsync based replication using rsync option --bwlimit.
  (Brandon Evans via koji)

* SOLR-1316: Create autosuggest component.
   (Ankul Garg, Jason Rutherglen, Shalin Shekhar Mangar, Grant Ingersoll, Robert Muir, ab)

* SOLR-1568: Added "native" filtering support for PointType, GeohashField.  Added LatLonType with filtering support too.  See
  http://wiki.apache.org/solr/SpatialSearch and the example.  Refactored some items in Lucene spatial.
  Removed SpatialTileField as the underlying CartesianTier is broken beyond repair and is going to be moved. (gsingers)

* SOLR-2128: Full parameter substitution for function queries.
  Example: q=add($v1,$v2)&v1=mul(popularity,5)&v2=20.0
  (yonik)

* SOLR-2133: Function query parser can now parse multiple comma separated
  value sources.  It also now fails if there is extra unexpected text
  after parsing the functions, instead of silently ignoring it.
  This allows expressions like q=dist(2,vector(1,2),$pt)&pt=3,4   (yonik)

* SOLR-2157: Suggester should return alpha-sorted results when onlyMorePopular=false (ab)

* SOLR-2010: Added ability to verify that spell checking collations have
   actual results in the index.  (James Dyer via gsingers)

* SOLR-2188: Added "maxTokenLength" argument to the factories for ClassicTokenizer,
  StandardTokenizer, and UAX29URLEmailTokenizer. (Steven Rowe)

* SOLR-2129: Added a Solr module for dynamic metadata extraction/indexing with Apache UIMA.
  See contrib/uima/README.txt for more information.  (Tommaso Teofili via rmuir)

* SOLR-2325: Allow tagging and exclusion of main query for faceting. (yonik)

* SOLR-2263: Add ability for RawResponseWriter to stream binary files as well as
  text files.  (Eric Pugh via yonik)

* SOLR-860: Add debug output for MoreLikeThis. (koji)

* SOLR-1057: Add PathHierarchyTokenizerFactory. (ryan, koji)

* SOLR-1804: Re-enabled clustering component on trunk, updated to latest
  version of Carrot2.  No more LGPL run-time dependencies.  This release of
  C2 also does not have a specific Lucene dependency.
  (Stanislaw Osinski, gsingers)

* SOLR-2282: Add distributed search support for search result clustering.
  (Brad Giaccio, Dawid Weiss, Stanislaw Osinski, rmuir, koji)

* SOLR-2210: Add icu-based tokenizer and filters to contrib/analysis-extras (rmuir)

* SOLR-1336: Add SmartChinese (word segmentation for Simplified Chinese)
  tokenizer and filters to contrib/analysis-extras (rmuir)

* SOLR-2211,LUCENE-2763: Added UAX29URLEmailTokenizerFactory, which implements
  UAX#29, a unicode algorithm with good results for most languages, as well as
  URL and E-mail tokenization according to the relevant RFCs.
  (Tom Burton-West via rmuir)

* SOLR-2237: Added StempelPolishStemFilterFactory to contrib/analysis-extras (rmuir)

* SOLR-1525: allow DIH to refer to core properties (noble)

* SOLR-1547: DIH TemplateTransformer copy objects more intelligently when the
  template is a single variable (noble)

* SOLR-1627: DIH VariableResolver should be fetched just in time (noble)

* SOLR-1583: DIH Create DataSources that return InputStream (noble)

* SOLR-1358: Integration of Tika and DataImportHandler (Akshay Ukey, noble)

* SOLR-1654: TikaEntityProcessor example added DIHExample
  (Akshay Ukey via noble)

* SOLR-1678: Move onError handling to DIH framework (noble)

* SOLR-1352: Multi-threaded implementation of DIH (noble)

* SOLR-1721: Add explicit option to run DataImportHandler in synchronous mode
  (Alexey Serba via noble)

* SOLR-1737: Added FieldStreamDataSource (noble)


Optimizations
----------------------

* SOLR-1679: Don't build up string messages in SolrCore.execute unless they
  are necessary for the current log level.
  (Fuad Efendi and hossman)

* SOLR-1874: Optimize PatternReplaceFilter for better performance. (rmuir, uschindler)

* SOLR-1968: speed up initial filter cache population for facet.method=enum and
  also big terms for multi-valued facet.method=fc.  The resulting speedup
  for the first facet request is anywhere from 30% to 32x, depending on how many
  terms are in the field and how many documents match per term.  (yonik)

* SOLR-2089: Speed up UnInvertedField faceting (facet.method=fc for
  multi-valued fields) when facet.limit is both high, and a high enough
  percentage of the number of unique terms in the field.  Extreme cases
  yield speedups over 3x. (yonik)

* SOLR-2046: add common functions to scripts-util. (koji)

* SOLR-1684: Switch clustering component to use the
  SolrIndexSearcher.doc(int, Set<String>) method b/c it can use the document
  cache (gsingers)

* SOLR-2200: Improve the performance of DataImportHandler for large
  delta-import updates. (Mark Waddle via rmuir)

Bug Fixes
----------------------
* SOLR-1769: Solr 1.4 Replication - Repeater throwing NullPointerException (Jörgen Rydenius via noble)

* SOLR-1432: Make the new ValueSource.getValues(context,reader) delegate
  to the original ValueSource.getValues(reader) so custom sources
  will work. (yonik)

* SOLR-1572: FastLRUCache correctly implemented the LRU policy only
  for the first 2B accesses. (yonik)

* SOLR-1582: copyField was ignored for BinaryField types (gsingers)

* SOLR-1563: Binary fields, including trie-based numeric fields, caused null
  pointer exceptions in the luke request handler. (yonik)

* SOLR-1577: The example solrconfig.xml defaulted to a solr data dir
  relative to the current working directory, even if a different solr home
  was being used.  The new behavior changes the default to a zero length
  string, which is treated the same as if no dataDir had been specified,
  hence the "data" directory under the solr home will be used.  (yonik)

* SOLR-1584: SolrJ - SolrQuery.setIncludeScore() incorrectly added
  fl=score to the parameter list instead of appending score to the
  existing field list. (yonik)

* SOLR-1580: Solr Configuration ignores 'mergeFactor' parameter, always
  uses Lucene default. (Lance Norskog via Mark Miller)

* SOLR-1593: ReverseWildcardFilter didn't work for surrogate pairs
  (i.e. code points outside of the BMP), resulting in incorrect
  matching.  This change requires reindexing for any content with
  such characters.  (Robert Muir, yonik)

* SOLR-1596: A rollback operation followed by the shutdown of Solr
  or the close of a core resulted in a warning:
  "SEVERE: SolrIndexWriter was not closed prior to finalize()" although
  there were no other consequences. (yonik)

* SOLR-1595: StreamingUpdateSolrServer used the platform default character
  set when streaming updates, rather than using UTF-8 as the HTTP headers
  indicated, leading to an encoding mismatch. (hossman, yonik)

* SOLR-1587: A distributed search request with fl=score, didn't match
  the behavior of a non-distributed request since it only returned
  the id,score fields instead of all fields in addition to score. (yonik)

* SOLR-1601: Schema browser does not indicate presence of charFilter. (koji)

* SOLR-1615: Backslash escaping did not work in quoted strings
  for local param arguments. (Wojtek Piaseczny, yonik)

* SOLR-1628: log contains incorrect number of adds and deletes.
  (Thijs Vonk via yonik)

* SOLR-343: Date faceting now respects facet.mincount limiting
  (Uri Boness, Raiko Eckstein via hossman)

* SOLR-1624: Highlighter only highlights values from the first field  value
  in a multivalued field when term positions (term vectors) are stored.
  (Chris Harris via yonik)

* SOLR-1635: Fixed error message when numeric values can't be parsed by
  DOMUtils - notably for plugin init params in solrconfig.xml.
  (hossman)

* SOLR-1651: Fixed Incorrect dataimport handler package name in SolrResourceLoader
  (Akshay Ukey via shalin)

* SOLR-1660: CapitalizationFilter crashes if you use the maxWordCountOption
  (Robert Muir via shalin)

* SOLR-1667: PatternTokenizer does not reset attributes such as positionIncrementGap
  (Robert Muir via shalin)

* SOLR-1711: SolrJ - StreamingUpdateSolrServer had a race condition that
  could halt the streaming of documents. The original patch to fix this
  (never officially released) introduced another hanging bug due to
  connections not being released.
  (Attila Babo, Erik Hetzner, Johannes Tuchscherer via yonik)

* SOLR-1748, SOLR-1747, SOLR-1746, SOLR-1745, SOLR-1744: Streams and Readers
  retrieved from ContentStreams are not closed in various places, resulting
  in file descriptor leaks.
  (Christoff Brill, Mark Miller)

* SOLR-1753: StatsComponent throws NPE when getting statistics for facets in distributed search
  (Janne Majaranta via koji)

* SOLR-1736:In the slave , If 'mov'ing file does not succeed , copy the file (noble)

* SOLR-1579: Fixes to XML escaping in stats.jsp
  (David Bowen and hossman)

* SOLR-1777: fieldTypes with sortMissingLast=true or sortMissingFirst=true can
  result in incorrectly sorted results.  (yonik)

* SOLR-1798: Small memory leak (~100 bytes) in fastLRUCache for every
  commit. (yonik)

* SOLR-1823: Fixed XMLResponseWriter (via XMLWriter) so it no longer throws
  a ClassCastException when a Map containing a non-String key is used.
  (Frank Wesemann, hossman)

* SOLR-1797: fix ConcurrentModificationException and potential memory
  leaks in ResourceLoader. (yonik)

* SOLR-1850: change KeepWordFilter so a new word set is not created for
  each instance (John Wang via yonik)

* SOLR-1706: fixed WordDelimiterFilter for certain combinations of options
  where it would output incorrect tokens. (Robert Muir, Chris Male)

* SOLR-1936: The JSON response format needed to escape unicode code point
  U+2028 - 'LINE SEPARATOR' (Robert Hofstra, yonik)

* SOLR-1914: Change the JSON response format to output float/double
  values of NaN,Infinity,-Infinity as strings. (yonik)

* SOLR-1948: PatternTokenizerFactory should use parent's args (koji)

* SOLR-1870: Indexing documents using the 'javabin' format no longer
  fails with a ClassCastException whenSolrInputDocuments contain field
  values which are Collections or other classes that implement
  Iterable. (noble, hossman)

* SOLR-1981: Solr will now fail correctly if solr.xml attempts to
  specify multiple cores that have the same name (hossman)

* SOLR-1791: Fix messed up core names on admin gui (yonik via koji)

* SOLR-1995: Change date format from "hour in am/pm" to "hour in day"
  in CoreContainer and SnapShooter. (Hayato Ito, koji)

* SOLR-2008: avoid possible RejectedExecutionException w/autoCommit
  by making SolreCore close the UpdateHandler before closing the
  SearchExecutor.  (NarasimhaRaju, hossman)

* SOLR-2036: Avoid expensive fieldCache ram estimation for the
  admin stats page. (yonik)

* SOLR-2047: ReplicationHandler should accept bool type for enable flag. (koji)

* SOLR-1630: Fix spell checking collation issue related to token positions (rmuir, gsingers)

* SOLR-2100: The replication handler backup command didn't save the commit
  point and hence could fail when a newer commit caused the older commit point
  to be removed before it was finished being copied.  This did not affect
  normal master/slave replication.  (Peter Sturge via yonik)

* SOLR-2114: Fixed parsing error in hsin function.  The function signature has changed slightly. (gsingers)

* SOLR-2083: SpellCheckComponent misreports suggestions when distributed (James Dyer via gsingers)

* SOLR-2111: Change exception handling in distributed faceting to work more
  like non-distributed faceting, change facet_counts/exception from a String
  to a List<String> to enable listing all exceptions that happened, and
  prevent an exception in one facet command from affecting another
  facet command. (yonik)

* SOLR-2110: Remove the restriction on names for local params
  substitution/dereferencing.  Properly encode local params in
  distributed faceting.  (yonik)

* SOLR-2135: Fix behavior of ConcurrentLRUCache when asking for
  getLatestAccessedItems(0) or getOldestAccessedItems(0).
  (David Smiley via hossman)

* SOLR-2148: Highlighter doesn't support q.alt. (koji)

* SOLR-2180: It was possible for EmbeddedSolrServer to leave searchers
  open if a request threw an exception. (yonik)

* SOLR-2173: Suggester should always rebuild Lookup data if Lookup.load fails. (ab)

* SOLR-2081: BaseResponseWriter.isStreamingDocs causes
  SingleResponseWriter.end to be called 2x
  (Chris A. Mattmann via hossman)

* SOLR-2219: The init() method of every SolrRequestHandler was being
  called twice. (ambikeshwar singh and hossman)

* SOLR-2285: duplicate SolrEventListeners no longer created (hossman)

* SOLR-1993: fix String cast assumption in JavaBinCodec - specific
  addresses "commitWithin" option on Update requests.
  (noble, hossman, and Maxim Valyanskiy)

* SOLR-2261: fix velocity template layout.vm that referred to an older
  version of jquery.  (Eric Pugh via rmuir)

* SOLR-2307: fix bug in PHPSerializedResponseWriter (wt=phps) when
  dealing with SolrDocumentList objects -- ie: sharded queries.
  (Antonio Verni via hossman)

* SOLR-2127: Fixed serialization of default core and indentation of solr.xml when serializing.
  (Ephraim Ofir, Mark Miller)

* SOLR-2320: Fixed ReplicationHandler detail reporting for masters
  (hossman)

* SOLR-482: Provide more exception handling in CSVLoader (gsingers)

* SOLR-1283: HTMLStripCharFilter sometimes threw a "Mark Invalid" exception.
  (Julien Coloos, hossman, yonik)

* SOLR-2085: Improve SolrJ behavior when FacetComponent comes before
  QueryComponent (Tomas Salfischberger via hossman)

* SOLR-1940: Fix SolrDispatchFilter behavior when Content-Type is
  unknown (Lance Norskog and hossman)

* SOLR-1983: snappuller fails when modifiedConfFiles is not empty and
  full copy of index is needed. (Alexander Kanarsky via yonik)

* SOLR-2156: SnapPuller fails to clean Old Index Directories on Full Copy
  (Jayendra Patil via yonik)

* SOLR-96: Fix XML parsing in XMLUpdateRequestHandler and
  DocumentAnalysisRequestHandler to respect charset from XML file and only
  use HTTP header's "Content-Type" as a "hint". (uschindler)

* SOLR-2339: Fix sorting to explicitly generate an error if you
  attempt to sort on a multiValued field. (hossman)

* SOLR-2348: Fix field types to explicitly generate an error if you
  attempt to get a ValueSource for a multiValued field. (hossman)

* SOLR-2380: Distributed faceting could miss values when facet.sort=index
  and when facet.offset was greater than 0. (yonik)

* SOLR-1656: XIncludes and other HREFs in XML files loaded by ResourceLoader
  are fixed to be resolved using the URI standard (RFC 2396). The system
  identifier is no longer a plain filename with path, it gets initialized
  using a custom URI scheme "solrres:". This scheme is resolved using a
  EntityResolver that utilizes ResourceLoader
  (org.apache.solr.common.util.SystemIdResolver). This makes all relative
  pathes in Solr's config files behave like expected. This change
  introduces some backwards breaks in the API: Some config classes
  (Config, SolrConfig, IndexSchema) were changed to take
  org.xml.sax.InputSource instead of InputStream. There may also be some
  backwards breaks in existing config files, it is recommended to check
  your config files / XSLTs and replace all XIncludes/HREFs that were
  hacked to use absolute paths to use relative ones. (uschindler)

* SOLR-309: Fix FieldType so setting an analyzer on a FieldType that
  doesn't expect it will generate an error.  Practically speaking this
  means that Solr will now correctly generate an error on
  initialization if the schema.xml contains an analyzer configuration
  for a fieldType that does not use TextField.  (hossman)

* SOLR-2192: StreamingUpdateSolrServer.blockUntilFinished was not
  thread safe and could throw an exception. (yonik)

* SOLR-1692: Fix bug in clustering component relating to carrot.produceSummary
  option (gsingers)

* SOLR-1756: The date.format setting for extraction request handler causes
  ClassCastException when enabled and the config code that parses this setting
  does not properly use the same iterator instance.
  (Christoph Brill, Mark Miller)

* SOLR-1638: Fixed NullPointerException during DIH import if uniqueKey is not
  specified in schema (Akshay Ukey via shalin)

* SOLR-1639: Fixed misleading error message when dataimport.properties is not

  (Drew Farris via koji)

* SOLR-1973: Empty fields in XML update messages confuse DataImportHandler.
  (koji)

* SOLR-2221: Use StrUtils.parseBool() to get values of boolean options in DIH.

Other Changes
----------------------

* SOLR-1602: Refactor SOLR package structure to include o.a.solr.response

* SOLR-1570: Log warnings if uniqueKey is multi-valued or not stored (hossman, shalin)

* SOLR-1558: QueryElevationComponent only works if the uniqueKey field is
  implemented using StrField.  In previous versions of Solr no warning or
  error would be generated if you attempted to use QueryElevationComponent,
  it would just fail in unexpected ways.  This has been changed so that it
  will fail with a clear error message on initialization. (hossman)

* SOLR-1611: Added Lucene 2.9.1 collation contrib jar to lib (shalin)

* SOLR-1608: Extract base class from TestDistributedSearch to make

* SOLR-1771: Improved error message when StringIndex cannot be initialized
  for a function query (hossman)

* SOLR-1695: Improved error messages when adding a document that does not
  contain exactly one value for the uniqueKey field (hossman)

* SOLR-1776: DismaxQParser and ExtendedDismaxQParser now use the schema.xml
  "defaultSearchField" as the default value for the "qf" param instead of failing
  with an error when "qf" is not specified.  (hossman)

* SOLR-1851: luceneAutoCommit no longer has any effect - it has been remove (Mark Miller)

  beginning of input files, these are often created by editors such as Windows
  Notepad.  (rmuir, hossman)

* SOLR-1938: ElisionFilterFactory will use a default set of French contractions
  if you do not supply a custom articles file.  (rmuir)

* SOLR-2003: SolrResourceLoader will report any encoding errors, rather than
  silently using replacement characters for invalid inputs (blargy via rmuir)

* SOLR-1804: Google collections updated to Google Guava (which is a superset of collections and contains bug fixes) (gsingers)

* SOLR-2034: Switch to JavaBin codec version 2. Strings are now serialized
  as the number of UTF-8 bytes, followed by the bytes in UTF-8. Previously
  Strings were serialized as the number of UTF-16 chars, followed by the
  bytes in Modified UTF-8. (hossman, yonik, rmuir)

* SOLR-2013: Add mapping-FoldToASCII.txt to example conf directory.
  (Steven Rowe via koji)

* SOLR-2213: Upgrade to jQuery 1.4.3 (Erick Erickson via ryan)

* SOLR-1826: Add unit tests for highlighting with termOffsets=true
  and overlapping tokens. (Stefan Oestreicher via rmuir)

* SOLR-2340: Add version infos to message in JavaBinCodec when throwing
  exception. (koji)

* SOLR-2350: Since Solr no longer requires XML files to be in UTF-8

  work with files of any mime-type or charset. (hossman)

* SOLR-2365: Move DIH jars out of solr.war (David Smiley via yonik)

* SOLR-2381: Include a patched version of Jetty (6.1.26 + JETTY-1340)
  to fix problematic UTF-8 handling for supplementary characters.
  (Bernd Fehling, uschindler, yonik, rmuir)

* SOLR-2391: The preferred Content-Type for XML was changed to
  application/xml. XMLResponseWriter now only delivers using this
  type; updating documents and analyzing documents is still supported
  using text/xml as Content-Type, too. If you have clients that are
  hardcoded on text/xml as Content-Type, you have to change them.
  (uschindler, rmuir)

* SOLR-2414: All ResponseWriters now use only ServletOutputStreams
  and wrap their own Writer around it when serializing. This fixes
  the bug in PHPSerializedResponseWriter that produced wrong string
  length if the servlet container had a broken UTF-8 encoding that was
  in fact CESU-8 (see SOLR-1091). The system property to enable the
  CESU-8 byte counting in PHPSerializesResponseWriters for broken
  servlet containers was therefore removed and is now ignored if set.
  Output is always UTF-8.  (uschindler, yonik, rmuir)

* SOLR-141: Errors and Exceptions are formated by ResponseWriter.
  (Mike Sokolov, Rich Cariens, Daniel Naber, ryan)

================== Release 1.4.0 ==================
Release Date:  See http://lucene.apache.org/solr for the official release date.

Upgrading from Solr 1.3
-----------------------

There is a new default faceting algorithm for multiVaued fields that should be
faster for most cases.  One can revert to the previous algorithm (which has
also been improved somewhat) by adding facet.method=enum to the request.

Searching and sorting is now done on a per-segment basis, meaning that
the FieldCache entries used for sorting and for function queries are
created and used per-segment and can be reused for segments that don't
change between index updates.  While generally beneficial, this can lead
to increased memory usage over 1.3 in certain scenarios:
  1) A single valued field that was used for both sorting and faceting
in 1.3 would have used the same top level FieldCache entry.  In 1.4,
sorting will use entries at the segment level while faceting will still
use entries at the top reader level, leading to increased memory usage.
  2) Certain function queries such as ord() and rord() require a top level
FieldCache instance and can thus lead to increased memory usage.  Consider
replacing ord() and rord() with alternatives, such as function queries
based on ms() for date boosting.

If you use custom Tokenizer or TokenFilter components in a chain specified in
schema.xml, they must support reusability.  If your Tokenizer or TokenFilter
maintains state, it should implement reset().  If your TokenFilteFactory does
not return a subclass of TokenFilter, then it should implement reset() and call
reset() on its input TokenStream.  TokenizerFactory implementations must
now return a Tokenizer rather than a TokenStream.

New users of Solr 1.4 will have omitTermFreqAndPositions enabled for non-text
indexed fields by default, which avoids indexing term frequency, positions, and
payloads, making the index smaller and faster.  If you are upgrading from an
earlier Solr release and want to enable omitTermFreqAndPositions by default,
change the schema version from 1.1 to 1.2 in schema.xml.  Remove any existing
index and restart Solr to ensure that omitTermFreqAndPositions completely takes
affect.

The default QParserPlugin used by the QueryComponent for parsing the "q" param
has been changed, to remove support for the deprecated use of ";" as a separator
between the query string and the sort options when no "sort" param was used.
Users who wish to continue using the semi-colon based method of specifying the
sort options should explicitly set the defType param to "lucenePlusSort" on all
requests. (The simplest way to do this is by specifying it as a default param
for your request handlers in solrconfig.xml, see the example solrconfig.xml for
sample syntax.)

If spellcheck.extendedResults=true, the response format for suggestions
has changed, see SOLR-1071.

Use of the "charset" option when configuring the following Analysis
Factories has been deprecated and will cause a warning to be logged.
In future versions of Solr attempting to use this option will cause an
error.  See SOLR-1410 for more information.
 - GreekLowerCaseFilterFactory
 - RussianStemFilterFactory
 - RussianLowerCaseFilterFactory
 - RussianLetterTokenizerFactory

DIH: Evaluator API has been changed in a non back-compatible way. Users who
have developed custom Evaluators will need to change their code according to
the new API for it to work. See SOLR-996 for details.

DIH: The formatDate evaluator's syntax has been changed. The new syntax is
formatDate(<variable>, '<format_string>'). For example,
formatDate(x.date, 'yyyy-MM-dd'). In the old syntax, the date string was
written without a single-quotes. The old syntax has been deprecated and will
be removed in 1.5, until then, using the old syntax will log a warning.

DIH: The Context API has been changed in a non back-compatible way. In
particular, the Context.currentProcess() method now returns a String
describing the type of the current import process instead of an int.
Similarily, the public constants in Context viz. FULL_DUMP, DELTA_DUMP and
FIND_DELTA are changed to a String type. See SOLR-969 for details.

DIH: The EntityProcessor API has been simplified by moving logic for applying
transformers and handling multi-row outputs from Transformers into an
EntityProcessorWrapper class. The EntityProcessor#destroy is now called once
per parent-row at the end of row (end of data). A new method
EntityProcessor#close is added which is called at the end of import.

DIH: In Solr 1.3, if the last_index_time was not available (first import) and
a delta-import was requested, a full-import was run instead. This is no longer
the case. In Solr 1.4 delta import is run with last_index_time as the epoch
date (January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 GMT) if last_index_time is not available.

Versions of Major Components
----------------------------
Apache Lucene 2.9.1  (r832363  on 2.9 branch)
Apache Tika 0.4
Carrot2 3.1.0

Lucene Information
----------------

Since Solr is built on top of Lucene, many people add customizations to Solr
that are dependent on Lucene.  Please see http://lucene.apache.org/java/2_9_0/,
especially http://lucene.apache.org/java/2_9_0/changes/Changes.html for more
information on the version of Lucene used in Solr.

Detailed Change List
----------------------

New Features
----------------------
 1. SOLR-560: Use SLF4J logging API rather then JDK logging.  The packaged .war file is
    shipped with a JDK logging implementation, so logging configuration for the .war should
    be identical to solr 1.3.  However, if you are using the .jar file, you can select
    which logging implementation to use by dropping a different binding.
    See: http://www.slf4j.org/  (ryan)

 2. SOLR-617: Allow configurable index deletion policy and provide a default implementation which
    allows deletion of commit points on various criteria such as number of commits, age of commit
    point and optimized status.
    See http://lucene.apache.org/java/2_3_2/api/org/apache/lucene/index/IndexDeletionPolicy.html
    (yonik, Noble Paul, Akshay Ukey via shalin)

 3. SOLR-658: Allow Solr to load index from arbitrary directory in dataDir
    (Noble Paul, Akshay Ukey via shalin)

 4. SOLR-793: Add 'commitWithin' argument to the update add command.  This behaves
    similar to the global autoCommit maxTime argument except that it is set for
    each request.  (ryan)

 5. SOLR-670: Add support for rollbacks in UpdateHandler. This allows user to rollback all changes
    since the last commit. (Noble Paul, koji via shalin)

 6. SOLR-813: Adding DoubleMetaphone Filter and Factory.  Similar to the PhoneticFilter,
    but this uses DoubleMetaphone specific calls (including alternate encoding)
    (Todd Feak via ryan)

 7. SOLR-680: Add StatsComponent. This gets simple statistics on matched numeric fields,
    including: min, max, mean, median, stddev.  (koji, ryan)

    - SOLR-1380: Added support for multi-valued fields (Harish Agarwal via gsingers)

 8. SOLR-561: Added Replication implemented in Java as a request handler. Supports index replication
    as well as configuration replication and exposes detailed statistics and progress information
    on the Admin page. Works on all platforms. (Noble Paul, yonik, Akshay Ukey, shalin)

 9. SOLR-746: Added "omitHeader" request parameter to omit the header from the response.
    (Noble Paul via shalin)

10. SOLR-651: Added TermVectorComponent for serving up term vector information, plus IDF.
    See http://wiki.apache.org/solr/TermVectorComponent (gsingers, Vaijanath N. Rao, Noble Paul)

12. SOLR-795: SpellCheckComponent supports building indices on optimize if configured in solrconfig.xml
    (Jason Rennie, shalin)

13. SOLR-667: A LRU cache implementation based upon ConcurrentHashMap and other techniques to reduce
    contention and synchronization overhead, to utilize multiple CPU cores more effectively.
    (Fuad Efendi, Noble Paul, yonik via shalin)

14. SOLR-465: Add configurable DirectoryProvider so that alternate Directory
    implementations can be specified via solrconfig.xml.  The default
    DirectoryProvider will use NIOFSDirectory for better concurrency
    on non Windows platforms.  (Mark Miller, TJ Laurenzo via yonik)

15. SOLR-822: Add CharFilter so that characters can be filtered (e.g. character normalization)
    before Tokenizer/TokenFilters. (koji)

16. SOLR-829: Allow slaves to request compressed files from master during replication
    (Simon Collins, Noble Paul, Akshay Ukey via shalin)

17. SOLR-877: Added TermsComponent for accessing Lucene's TermEnum capabilities.
    Useful for auto suggest and possibly distributed search.  Not distributed search compliant.  (gsingers)
    - Added mincount and maxcount options (Khee Chin via gsingers)

18. SOLR-538: Add maxChars attribute for copyField function so that the length limit for destination
    can be specified.
    (Georgios Stamatis, Lars Kotthoff, Chris Harris via koji)

19. SOLR-284: Added support for extracting content from binary documents like MS Word and PDF using Apache Tika.  See also contrib/extraction/CHANGES.txt (Eric Pugh, Chris Harris, yonik, gsingers)

20. SOLR-819: Added factories for Arabic support (gsingers)

21. SOLR-781: Distributed search ability to sort field.facet values
    lexicographically.  facet.sort values "true" and "false" are
    also deprecated and replaced with "count" and "lex".
    (Lars Kotthoff via yonik)

22. SOLR-821: Add support for replication to copy conf file to slave with a different name. This allows replication
    of solrconfig.xml
    (Noble Paul, Akshay Ukey via shalin)

23. SOLR-911: Add support for multi-select faceting by allowing filters to be
    tagged and facet commands to exclude certain filters.  This patch also
    added the ability to change the output key for facets in the response, and
    optimized distributed faceting refinement by lowering parsing overhead and
    by making requests and responses smaller.

24. SOLR-876: WordDelimiterFilter now supports a splitOnNumerics
    option, as well as a list of protected terms.
    (Dan Rosher via hossman)

25. SOLR-928: SolrDocument and SolrInputDocument now implement the Map<String,?>
    interface.  This should make plugging into other standard tools easier. (ryan)

26. SOLR-847: Enhance the snappull command in ReplicationHandler to accept masterUrl.
    (Noble Paul, Preetam Rao via shalin)

27. SOLR-540: Add support for globbing in field names to highlight.
    For example, hl.fl=*_text will highlight all fieldnames ending with
    _text.  (Lars Kotthoff via yonik)

28. SOLR-906: Adding a StreamingUpdateSolrServer that writes update commands to
    an open HTTP connection.  If you are using solrj for bulk update requests
    you should consider switching to this implementaion.  However, note that
    the error handling is not immediate as it is with the standard SolrServer.
    (ryan)

29. SOLR-865: Adding support for document updates in binary format and corresponding support in Solrj client.
    (Noble Paul via shalin)

30. SOLR-763: Add support for Lucene's PositionFilter (Mck SembWever via shalin)

31. SOLR-966: Enhance the map() function query to take in an optional default value (Noble Paul, shalin)

32. SOLR-820: Support replication on startup of master with new index. (Noble Paul, Akshay Ukey via shalin)

33. SOLR-943: Make it possible to specify dataDir in solr.xml and accept the dataDir as a request parameter for
    the CoreAdmin create command. (Noble Paul via shalin)

34. SOLR-850: Addition of timeouts for distributed searching. Configurable through 'shard-socket-timeout' and
    'shard-connection-timeout' parameters in SearchHandler. (Patrick O'Leary via shalin)

35. SOLR-799: Add support for hash based exact/near duplicate document
    handling. (Mark Miller, yonik)

36. SOLR-1026: Add protected words support to SnowballPorterFilterFactory (ehatcher)

37. SOLR-739: Add support for OmitTf (Mark Miller via yonik)

38. SOLR-1046: Nested query support for the function query parser
    and lucene query parser (the latter existed as an undocumented
    feature in 1.3) (yonik)

39. SOLR-940: Add support for Lucene's Trie Range Queries by providing new FieldTypes in
    schema for int, float, long, double and date.  Single-valued Trie based
    fields with a precisionStep will index multiple precisions and enable
    faster range queries.  (Uwe Schindler, yonik, shalin)

40. SOLR-1038: Enhance CommonsHttpSolrServer to add docs in batch using an iterator API (Noble Paul via shalin)

41. SOLR-844: A SolrServer implementation to front-end multiple solr servers and provides load balancing and failover
    support (Noble Paul, Mark Miller, hossman via shalin)

42. SOLR-939: ValueSourceRangeFilter/Query - filter based on values in a FieldCache entry or on any arbitrary function of field values. (yonik)

43. SOLR-1095: Fixed performance problem in the StopFilterFactory and simplified code.  Added tests as well.  (gsingers)

44. SOLR-1096: Introduced httpConnTimeout and httpReadTimeout in replication slave configuration to avoid stalled
    replication. (Jeff Newburn, Noble Paul, shalin)

45. SOLR-1115: <bool>on</bool> and <bool>yes</bool> work as expected in solrconfig.xml. (koji)

46. SOLR-1099:  A FieldAnalysisRequestHandler which provides the analysis functionality of the web admin page as
    a service. The AnalysisRequestHandler is renamed to DocumentAnalysisRequestHandler which is enhanced with
    query analysis and showMatch support. AnalysisRequestHandler is now deprecated. Support for both
    FieldAnalysisRequestHandler and DocumentAnalysisRequestHandler is also provided in the Solrj client.
    (Uri Boness, shalin)

    event happened.  QuerySenderListender is the only implementation in Solr that implements this, but outside
    implementations may wish to.  See the AbstractSolrEventListener for a helper method. (gsingers)

    (Wojciech Biela via shalin)

36. SOLR-458: Add equals and hashCode methods to NamedList (Stefan Rinner, shalin)

37. SOLR-1184: Add option in solrconfig to open a new IndexReader rather than
    using reopen. Done mainly as a fail-safe in the case that a user runs into
    a reopen bug/issue.  (Mark Miller)

38. SOLR-1215 use double quotes to enclose attributes in solr.xml (noble)

39. SOLR-1151: add dynamic copy field and maxChars example to example schema.xml.
    (Peter Wolanin, Mark Miller)

40. SOLR-1233: remove /select?qt=/whatever restriction on /-prefixed request handlers.
    (ehatcher)

41. SOLR-1257: logging.jsp has been removed and now passes through to the
    hierarchical log level tool added in Solr 1.3.  Users still
    hitting "/admin/logging.jsp" should switch to "/admin/logging".
    (hossman)

42. Upgraded to Lucene 2.9-dev r794238. Other changes include:
    - LUCENE-1614 - Use Lucene's DocIdSetIterator.NO_MORE_DOCS as the sentinel value.
    - LUCENE-1630 - Add acceptsDocsOutOfOrder method to Collector implementations.
    - LUCENE-1673, LUCENE-1701 - Trie has moved to Lucene core and renamed to NumericRangeQuery.

43. SOLR-1261: Lucene trunk renamed RangeQuery & Co to TermRangeQuery (Uwe Schindler via shalin)

44. Upgraded to Lucene 2.9-dev r801856 (Mark Miller)

45. SOLR-1276: Added StatsComponentTest (Rafał Kuć, gsingers)

46. SOLR-1377:  The TokenizerFactory API has changed to explicitly return a Tokenizer
    rather then a TokenStream (that may be or may not be a Tokenizer).  This change
    is required to take advantage of the Token reuse improvements in lucene 2.9. (ryan)

47. SOLR-1410: Log a warning if the deprecated charset option is used
    on GreekLowerCaseFilterFactory, RussianStemFilterFactory,
    RussianLowerCaseFilterFactory or RussianLetterTokenizerFactory.
    (Robert Muir via hossman)

48. SOLR-1423: Due to LUCENE-1906, Solr's tokenizer should use Tokenizer.correctOffset() instead of CharStream.correctOffset().
    (Uwe Schindler via koji)

49. SOLR-1319, SOLR-1345: Upgrade Solr Highlighter classes to new Lucene Highlighter API. This upgrade has
    resulted in a back compat break in the DefaultSolrHighlighter class - getQueryScorer is no longer
    protected. If you happened to be overriding that method in custom code, overide getHighlighter instead.
    Also, HighlightingUtils#getQueryScorer has been removed as it was deprecated and backcompat has been
    broken with it anyway.  (Mark Miller)

50. SOLR-1357 SolrInputDocument cannot process dynamic fields (Lars Grote via noble)

51. SOLR-1075: Upgrade to Tika 0.3.  See http://www.apache.org/dist/lucene/tika/CHANGES-0.3.txt (gsingers)

52. SOLR-1310: Upgrade to Tika 0.4. Note there are some differences in
    detecting Languages now in extracting request handler.
    See http://www.lucidimagination.com/search/document/d6f1899a85b2a45c/vote_apache_tika_0_4_release_candidate_2#d6f1899a85b2a45c
    for discussion on language detection.
    See http://www.apache.org/dist/lucene/tika/CHANGES-0.4.txt. (gsingers)

53. SOLR-782: DIH: Refactored SolrWriter to make it a concrete class and
    removed wrappers over SolrInputDocument.  Refactored to load Evaluators
    lazily. Removed multiple document nodes in the configuration xml. Removed
    support for 'default' variables, they are automatically available as
    request parameters. (Noble Paul via shalin)

54. SOLR-964: DIH: XPathEntityProcessor now ignores DTD validations
    (Fergus McMenemie, Noble Paul via shalin)

55. SOLR-1029: DIH: Standardize Evaluator parameter parsing and added helper
    functions for parsing all evaluator parameters in a standard way.
    (Noble Paul, shalin)

56. SOLR-1081: Change DIH EventListener to be an interface so that components
    such as an EntityProcessor or a Transformer can act as an event listener.
    (Noble Paul, shalin)

57. SOLR-1027: DIH: Alias the 'dataimporter' namespace to a shorter name 'dih'.
    (Noble Paul via shalin)

58. SOLR-1084: Better error reporting when DIH entity name is a reserved word
    and data-config.xml root node is not <dataConfig>.
    (Noble Paul via shalin)

59. SOLR-1087: Deprecate 'where' attribute in CachedSqlEntityProcessor in
    favor of cacheKey and cacheLookup. (Noble Paul via shalin)

60. SOLR-969: Change the FULL_DUMP, DELTA_DUMP, FIND_DELTA constants in DIH
    Context to String.  Change Context.currentProcess() to return a string
    instead of an integer.  (Kay Kay, Noble Paul, shalin)

61. SOLR-1120: Simplified DIH EntityProcessor API by moving logic for applying
    transformers and handling multi-row outputs from Transformers into an
    EntityProcessorWrapper class. The behavior of the method
    EntityProcessor#destroy has been modified to be called once per parent-row
    at the end of row. A new method EntityProcessor#close is added which is
    called at the end of import. A new method
    Context#getResolvedEntityAttribute is added which returns the resolved
    value of an entity's attribute. Introduced a DocWrapper which takes care
    of maintaining document level session variables.
    (Noble Paul, shalin)

62. SOLR-1265: Add DIH variable resolving for URLDataSource properties like
    baseUrl.  (Chris Eldredge via ehatcher)

63. SOLR-1269: Better error messages from DIH JdbcDataSource when JDBC Driver
    name or SQL is incorrect. (ehatcher, shalin)

    instructions.


================== Release 1.3.0 ==================

Upgrading from Solr 1.2
-----------------------
IMPORTANT UPGRADE NOTE: In a master/slave configuration, all searchers/slaves
should be upgraded before the master!  If the master were to be updated
first, the older searchers would not be able to read the new index format.

The Porter snowball based stemmers in Lucene were updated (LUCENE-1142),
and are not guaranteed to be backward compatible at the index level
(the stem of certain words may have changed).  Re-indexing is recommended.

Older Apache Solr installations can be upgraded by replacing
the relevant war file with the new version.  No changes to configuration
files should be needed.

This version of Solr contains a new version of Lucene implementing
an updated index format.  This version of Solr/Lucene can still read
and update indexes in the older formats, and will convert them to the new
format on the first index change.  Be sure to backup your index before
upgrading in case you need to downgrade.

Solr now recognizes HTTP Request headers related to HTTP Caching (see
RFC 2616 sec13) and will by default respond with "304 Not Modified"
when appropriate.  This should only affect users who access Solr via
an HTTP Cache, or via a Web-browser that has an internal cache, but if
you wish to suppress this behavior an '<httpCaching never304="true"/>'
option can be added to your solrconfig.xml.  See the wiki (or the
example solrconfig.xml) for more details...
   http://wiki.apache.org/solr/SolrConfigXml#HTTPCaching

In Solr 1.2, DateField did not enforce the canonical representation of
the ISO 8601 format when parsing incoming data, and did not generation
the canonical format when generating dates from "Date Math" strings
(particularly as it pertains to milliseconds ending in trailing zeros).
As a result equivalent dates could not always be compared properly.
This problem is corrected in Solr 1.3, but DateField users that might
have been affected by indexing inconsistent formats of equivalent
dates (ie: 1995-12-31T23:59:59Z vs 1995-12-31T23:59:59.000Z) may want
to consider reindexing to correct these inconsistencies.  Users who
depend on some of the the "broken" behavior of DateField in Solr 1.2
(specificly: accepting any input that ends in a 'Z') should consider
using the LegacyDateField class as a possible alternative.  Users that
desire 100% backwards compatibility should consider using the Solr 1.2
version of DateField.

Due to some changes in the lifecycle of TokenFilterFactories, users of
Solr 1.2 who have written Java code which constructs new instances of
StopFilterFactory, SynonymFilterFactory, or EnglishProterFilterFactory
will need to modify their code by adding a line like the following
prior to using the factory object...
  factory.inform(SolrCore.getSolrCore().getSolrConfig().getResourceLoader());
These lifecycle changes do not affect people who use Solr "out of the
box" or who have developed their own TokenFilterFactory plugins. More
info can be found in SOLR-594.

The python client that used to ship with Solr is no longer included in
the distribution (see client/python/README.txt).

Detailed Change List
--------------------

New Features
 1. SOLR-69: Adding MoreLikeThisHandler to search for similar documents using
    lucene contrib/queries MoreLikeThis.  MoreLikeThis is also available from
    the StandardRequestHandler using ?mlt=true. (bdelacretaz, ryan)

 2. SOLR-253: Adding KeepWordFilter and KeepWordFilterFactory.  A TokenFilter
    that keeps tokens with text in the registered keeplist.  This behaves like
    the inverse of StopFilter. (ryan)

 3. SOLR-257: WordDelimiterFilter has a new parameter splitOnCaseChange,
    which can be set to 0 to disable splitting "PowerShot" => "Power" "Shot".
    (klaas)

 4. SOLR-193: Adding SolrDocument and SolrInputDocument to represent documents
    outside of the lucene Document infrastructure.  This class will be used
    by clients and for processing documents. (ryan)

 5. SOLR-244: Added ModifiableSolrParams - a SolrParams implementation that
    help you change values after initialization. (ryan)

 6. SOLR-20: Added a java client interface with two implementations.  One
    implementation uses commons httpclient to connect to solr via HTTP.  The
    other connects to solr directly.  Check client/java/solrj.  This addition
    also includes tests that start jetty and test a connection using the full
    HTTP request cycle.  (Darren Erik Vengroff, Will Johnson, ryan)

 7. SOLR-133: Added StaxUpdateRequestHandler that uses StAX for XML parsing.
    This implementation has much better error checking and lets you configure
    a custom UpdateRequestProcessor that can selectively process update
    requests depending on the request attributes.  This class will likely
    replace XmlUpdateRequestHandler.  (Thorsten Scherler, ryan)

 8. SOLR-264: Added RandomSortField, a utility field with a random sort order.
    The seed is based on a hash of the field name, so a dynamic field
    of this type is useful for generating different random sequences.
    This field type should only be used for sorting or as a value source
    in a FunctionQuery (ryan, hossman, yonik)

 9. SOLR-266: Adding show=schema to LukeRequestHandler to show the parsed
    schema fields and field types.  (ryan)

10. SOLR-133: The UpdateRequestHandler now accepts multiple delete options
    within a single request.  For example, sending:
     <delete><id>1</id><id>2</id></delete> will delete both 1 and 2. (ryan)

11. SOLR-269: Added UpdateRequestProcessor plugin framework.  This provides
    a reasonable place to process documents after they are parsed and
    before they are committed to the index.  This is a good place for custom
    document manipulation or document based authorization. (yonik, ryan)

12. SOLR-260: Converting to a standard PluginLoader framework.  This reworks
    RequestHandlers, FieldTypes, and QueryResponseWriters to share the same
    base code for loading and initializing plugins.  This adds a new
    configuration option to define the default RequestHandler and
    QueryResponseWriter in XML using default="true".  (ryan)

13. SOLR-225: Enable pluggable highlighting classes.  Allow configurable
    highlighting formatters and Fragmenters.  (ryan)

14. SOLR-273/376/452/516: Added hl.maxAnalyzedChars highlighting parameter, defaulting
    to 50k, hl.alternateField, which allows the specification of a backup
    field to use as summary if no keywords are matched, and hl.mergeContiguous,
    which combines fragments if they are adjacent in the source document.
    (klaas, Grant Ingersoll, Koji Sekiguchi via klaas)

15. SOLR-291: Control maximum number of documents to cache for any entry
    in the queryResultCache via queryResultMaxDocsCached solrconfig.xml
    entry. (Koji Sekiguchi via yonik)

16. SOLR-240: New <lockType> configuration setting in <mainIndex> and
    <indexDefaults> blocks supports all Lucene builtin LockFactories.
    'single' is recommended setting, but 'simple' is default for total
    backwards compatibility.
    (Will Johnson via hossman)

17. SOLR-248: Added CapitalizationFilterFactory that creates tokens with
    normalized capitalization.  This filter is useful for facet display,
    but will not work with a prefix query.  (ryan)
    SOLR-468: Change to the semantics to keep the original token, not the
    token in the Map.  Also switched to use Lucene's new reusable token
    capabilities.  (gsingers)

18. SOLR-307: Added NGramFilterFactory and EdgeNGramFilterFactory.
    (Thomas Peuss via Otis Gospodnetic)

19. SOLR-305: analysis.jsp can be given a fieldtype instead of a field
    name.  (hossman)

20. SOLR-102: Added RegexFragmenter, which splits text for highlighting
    based on a given pattern.  (klaas)

21. SOLR-258: Date Faceting added to SimpleFacets.  Facet counts
    computed for ranges of size facet.date.gap (a DateMath expression)
    between facet.date.start and facet.date.end.  (hossman)

22. SOLR-196: A PHP serialized "phps" response writer that returns a
    serialized array that can be used with the PHP function unserialize,
    and a PHP response writer "php" that may be used by eval.
    (Nick Jenkin, Paul Borgermans, Pieter Berkel via yonik)

23. SOLR-308: A new UUIDField class which accepts UUID string values,
    as well as the special value of "NEW" which triggers generation of
    a new random UUID.
    (Thomas Peuss via hossman)

24. SOLR-349: New FunctionQuery functions: sum, product, div, pow, log,
    sqrt, abs, scale, map.  Constants may now be used as a value source.
    (yonik)

25. SOLR-359: Add field type className to Luke response, and enabled access
    to the detailed field information from the solrj client API.
    (Grant Ingersoll via ehatcher)

26. SOLR-334: Pluggable query parsers.  Allows specification of query
    type and arguments as a prefix on a query string. (yonik)

27. SOLR-351: External Value Source.  An external file may be used
     to specify the values of a field, currently usable as
     a ValueSource in a FunctionQuery. (yonik)

28. SOLR-395: Many new features for the spell checker implementation, including
    an extended response mode with much richer output, multi-word spell checking,
    and a bevy of new and renamed options (see the wiki).
    (Mike Krimerman, Scott Taber via klaas).

29. SOLR-408: Added PingRequestHandler and deprecated SolrCore.getPingQueryRequest().
    Ping requests should be configured using standard RequestHandler syntax in
    solrconfig.xml rather then using the <pingQuery></pingQuery> syntax.
    (Karsten Sperling via ryan)

30. SOLR-281: Added a 'Search Component' interface and converted StandardRequestHandler
    and DisMaxRequestHandler to use this framework.
    (Sharad Agarwal, Henri Biestro, yonik, ryan)

31. SOLR-176: Add detailed timing data to query response output.  The SearchHandler
    interface now returns how long each section takes.  (klaas)

32. SOLR-414: Plugin initialization now supports SolrCore and ResourceLoader "Aware"
    plugins.  Plugins that implement SolrCoreAware or ResourceLoaderAware are
    informed about the SolrCore/ResourceLoader. (Henri Biestro, ryan)

33. SOLR-350: Support multiple SolrCores running in the same solr instance and allows
    runtime runtime management for any running SolrCore.  If a solr.xml file exists
    in solr.home, this file is used to instanciate multiple cores and enables runtime
    core manipulation.  For more informaion see:  http://wiki.apache.org/solr/CoreAdmin
    (Henri Biestro, ryan)

34. SOLR-447: Added an single request handler that will automatically register all
    standard admin request handlers.  This replaces the need to register (and maintain)
    the set of admin request handlers.  Assuming solrconfig.xml includes:
     <requestHandler name="/admin/" class="org.apache.solr.handler.admin.AdminHandlers" />
    This will register: Luke/SystemInfo/PluginInfo/ThreadDump/PropertiesRequestHandler.
    (ryan)

35. SOLR-142: Added RawResponseWriter and ShowFileRequestHandler.  This returns config
    files directly.  If AdminHandlers are configured, this will be added automatically.
    The jsp files /admin/get-file.jsp and /admin/raw-schema.jsp have been deprecated.
    The deprecated <admin><gettableFiles> will be automatically registered with
    a ShowFileRequestHandler instance for backwards compatibility. (ryan)

36. SOLR-446: TextResponseWriter can write SolrDocuments and SolrDocumentLists the
    same way it writes Document and DocList.  (yonik, ryan)

37. SOLR-418: Adding a query elevation component.  This is an optional component to
    elevate some documents to the top positions (or exclude them) for a given query.
    (ryan)

38. SOLR-478: Added ability to get back unique key information from the LukeRequestHandler.
    (gsingers)

39. SOLR-127: HTTP Caching awareness.  Solr now recognizes HTTP Request
    headers related to HTTP Caching (see RFC 2616 sec13) and will respond
    with "304 Not Modified" when appropriate.  New options have been added
    to solrconfig.xml to influence this behavior.
    (Thomas Peuss via hossman)

40. SOLR-303: Distributed Search over HTTP.  Specification of shards
    argument causes Solr to query those shards and merge the results
    into a single response.  Querying, field faceting (sorted only),
    query faceting, highlighting, and debug information are supported
    in distributed mode.
    (Sharad Agarwal, Patrick O'Leary, Sabyasachi Dalal, Stu Hood,
     Jayson Minard, Lars Kotthoff, ryan, yonik)

41. SOLR-356: Pluggable functions (value sources) that allow
    registration of new functions via solrconfig.xml
    (Doug Daniels via yonik)

42. SOLR-494: Added cool admin Ajaxed schema explorer.
    (Greg Ludington via ehatcher)

43. SOLR-497: Added date faceting to the QueryResponse in SolrJ
    and QueryResponseTest (Shalin Shekhar Mangar via gsingers)

44. SOLR-486: Binary response format, faster and smaller
    than XML and JSON response formats (use wt=javabin).
    BinaryResponseParser for utilizing the binary format via SolrJ
    and is now the default.
    (Noble Paul, yonik)

45. SOLR-521: StopFilterFactory support for "enablePositionIncrements"
    (Walter Ferrara via hossman)

46. SOLR-557: Added SolrCore.getSearchComponents() to return an unmodifiable Map. (gsingers)

47. SOLR-516: Added hl.maxAlternateFieldLength parameter, to set max length for hl.alternateField
    (Koji Sekiguchi via klaas)

48. SOLR-319: Changed SynonymFilterFactory to "tokenize" synonyms file.
    To use a tokenizer, specify "tokenizerFactory" attribute in <filter>.
    For example:
    <tokenizer class="solr.CJKTokenizerFactory"/>
    <filter class="solr.SynonymFilterFactory" synonyms="synonyms.txt" expand="true"
      ignoreCase="true" tokenizerFactory="solr.CJKTokenizerFactory"/>
    (koji)

49. SOLR-515: Added SimilarityFactory capability to schema.xml,
    making config file parameters usable in the construction of
    the global Lucene Similarity implementation.
    (ehatcher)

50. SOLR-536: Add a DocumentObjectBinder to solrj that converts Objects to and
    from SolrDocuments.  (Noble Paul via ryan)

51. SOLR-595: Add support for Field level boosting in the MoreLikeThis Handler.
    (Tom Morton, gsingers)

52. SOLR-572: Added SpellCheckComponent and org.apache.solr.spelling package to support more spell
    checking functionality.  Also includes ability to add your own SolrSpellChecker implementation that
    plugs in.  See http://wiki.apache.org/solr/SpellCheckComponent for more details
    (Shalin Shekhar Mangar, Bojan Smid, gsingers)

53. SOLR-679: Added accessor methods to Lucene based spell checkers (gsingers)

54. SOLR-423: Added Request Handler close hook notification so that RequestHandlers can be notified
    when a core is closing.  (gsingers, ryan)

55. SOLR-603: Added ability to partially optimize. (gsingers)

56. SOLR-483: Add byte/short sorting support (gsingers)

57. SOLR-14: Add preserveOriginal flag to WordDelimiterFilter
    (Geoffrey Young, Trey Hyde, Ankur Madnani, yonik)

58. SOLR-502: Add search timeout support. (Sean Timm via yonik)

59. SOLR-605: Add the ability to register callbacks programatically (ryan, Noble Paul)

60. SOLR-610: hl.maxAnalyzedChars can be -1 to highlight everything (Lars Kotthoff via klaas)

61. SOLR-522: Make analysis.jsp show payloads. (Tricia Williams via yonik)

62. SOLR-611: Expose sort_values returned by QueryComponent in SolrJ's QueryResponse
    (Dan Rosher via shalin)

63. SOLR-256: Support exposing Solr statistics through JMX (Sharad Agrawal, shalin)

64. SOLR-666: Expose warmup time in statistics for SolrIndexSearcher and LRUCache (shalin)

65. SOLR-663: Allow multiple files for stopwords, keepwords, protwords and synonyms
    (Otis Gospodnetic, shalin)

66. SOLR-469: Added DataImportHandler as a contrib project which makes indexing data from Databases,
    XML files and HTTP data sources into Solr quick and easy. Includes API and implementations for
    supporting multiple data sources, processors and transformers for importing data. Supports full
    data imports as well as incremental (delta) indexing. See http://wiki.apache.org/solr/DataImportHandler
    for more details. (Noble Paul, shalin)

67. SOLR-622: SpellCheckComponent supports auto-loading indices on startup and optionally, (re)builds
    indices on newSearcher event, if configured in solrconfig.xml (shalin)

68. SOLR-554: Hierarchical JDK log level selector for SOLR Admin replaces logging.jsp
    (Sean Timm via shalin)

69. SOLR-506: Emitting HTTP Cache headers can be enabled or disabled through configuration on a
    per-handler basis (shalin)

70. SOLR-716: Added support for properties in configuration files. Properties can be specified in
    solr.xml and can be used in solrconfig.xml and schema.xml (Henri Biestro, hossman, ryan, shalin)

71. SOLR-1129 : Support binding dynamic fields to beans in SolrJ (Avlesh Singh , noble)

72. SOLR-920 : Cache and reuse IndexSchema . A new attribute added in solr.xml called 'shareSchema' (noble)

73. SOLR-700: DIH: Allow configurable locales through a locale attribute in
    fields for NumberFormatTransformer. (Stefan Oestreicher, shalin)

Changes in runtime behavior
 1. SOLR-559: use Lucene updateDocument, deleteDocuments methods.  This
    removes the maxBufferedDeletes parameter added by SOLR-310 as Lucene
    now manages the deletes.  This provides slightly better indexing
    performance and makes overwrites atomic, eliminating the possibility of
    a crash causing duplicates. (yonik)

 2. SOLR-689 / SOLR-695: If you have used "MultiCore" functionality in an unreleased
    version of 1.3-dev, many classes and configs have been renamed for the official
    1.3 release.  Speciffically, solr.xml has replaced multicore.xml, and uses a slightly
    different syntax.  The solrj classes: MultiCore{Request/Response/Params} have been
    renamed:  CoreAdmin{Request/Response/Params}  (hossman, ryan, Henri Biestro)

 3. SOLR-647: reference count the SolrCore uses to prevent a premature
    close while a core is still in use.  (Henri Biestro, Noble Paul, yonik)

 4. SOLR-737: SolrQueryParser now uses a ConstantScoreQuery for wildcard
    queries that prevent an exception from being thrown when the number
    of matching terms exceeds the BooleanQuery clause limit.  (yonik)

Optimizations
 1. SOLR-276: improve JSON writer speed. (yonik)

 2. SOLR-310: bound and reduce memory usage by providing <maxBufferedDeletes> parameter,
    which flushes deleted without forcing the user to use <commit/> for this purpose.
    (klaas)

 3. SOLR-348: short-circuit faceting if less than mincount docs match. (yonik)

 4. SOLR-354: Optimize removing all documents.  Now when a delete by query
    of *:* is issued, the current index is removed. (yonik)

 5. SOLR-377: Speed up response writers. (yonik)

 6. SOLR-342:  Added support into the SolrIndexWriter for using several new features of the new
    LuceneIndexWriter, including: setRAMBufferSizeMB(), setMergePolicy(), setMergeScheduler.
    Also, added support to specify Lucene's autoCommit functionality (not to be confused with Solr's
    similarily named autoCommit functionality) via the <luceneAutoCommit> config. item.  See the test
    and example solrconfig.xml <indexDefaults> section for usage.  Performance during indexing should
    be significantly increased by moving up to 2.3 due to Lucene's new indexing capabilities.
    Furthermore, the setRAMBufferSizeMB makes it more logical to decide on tuning factors related to
    indexing.  For best performance, leave the mergePolicy and mergeScheduler as the defaults and set
    ramBufferSizeMB instead of maxBufferedDocs.  The best value for this depends on the types of
    documents in use.  32 should be a good starting point, but reports have shown up to 48 MB provides
    good results. Note, it is acceptable to set both ramBufferSizeMB and maxBufferedDocs, and Lucene
    will flush based on whichever limit is reached first. (gsingers)

 7. SOLR-330: Converted TokenStreams to use Lucene's new char array based
    capabilities. (gsingers)

 8. SOLR-624: Only take snapshots if there are differences to the index (Richard Trey Hyde via gsingers)

 9. SOLR-587: Delete by Query performance greatly improved by using
    new underlying Lucene IndexWriter implementation.  (yonik)

10. SOLR-730: Use read-only IndexReaders that don't synchronize
    isDeleted().  This will speed up function queries and *:* queries
    as well as improve their scalability on multi-CPU systems.
    (Mark Miller via yonik)

Bug Fixes

 8. SOLR-282: Snapshooter does not work on Solaris and OS X since the cp command
    there does not have the -l option.  Also updated commit/optimize related
    scripts to handle both old and new response format.  (bill)

 9. SOLR-294: Logging of elapsed time broken on Solaris because the date command
    there does not support the %s output format.  (bill)

10. SOLR-136: Snappuller - "date -d" and locales don't mix.  (Jürgen Hermann via bill)

11. SOLR-333: Changed distributiondump.jsp to use Solr HOME instead of CWD to set path.

12. SOLR-393: Removed duplicate contentType from raw-schema.jsp. (bill)

13. SOLR-413: Requesting a large numbers of documents to be returned (limit)
    can result in an out-of-memory exception, even for a small index. (yonik)

14. The CSV loader incorrectly threw an exception when given
    header=true (the default).  (ryan, yonik)

15. SOLR-449: the python and ruby response writers are now able to correctly
    output NaN and Infinity in their respective languages.  (klaas)

    (hossman)

25. SOLR-400: SolrExceptionTest should now handle using OpenDNS as a DNS provider (gsingers)

26. SOLR-541: Legacy XML update support (provided by SolrUpdateServlet
    when no RequestHandler is mapped to "/update") now logs error correctly.
    (hossman)

27. SOLR-267: Changed logging to report number of hits, and also provide a mechanism to add log
    messages to be output by the SolrCore via a NamedList toLog member variable.
    (Will Johnson, yseeley, gsingers)

    - SOLR-267: Removed adding values to the HTTP headers in SolrDispatchFilter (gsingers)

28. SOLR-509: Moved firstSearcher event notification to the end of the SolrCore constructor

34. SOLR-590: Limitation in pgrep on Linux platform breaks script-utils fixUser.
    (Hannes Schmidt via billa)

35. SOLR-597: SolrServlet no longer "caches" SolrCore.  This was causing
    problems in Resin, and could potentially cause problems for customized
    usages of SolrServlet.

36. SOLR-585: Now sets the QParser on the ResponseBuilder (gsingers)

37. SOLR-604: If the spellchecking path is relative, make it relative to the Solr Data Directory.
    (Shalin Shekhar Mangar via gsingers)

38. SOLR-584: Make stats.jsp and stats.xsl more robust.
    (Yousef Ourabi and hossman)

39. SOLR-443: SolrJ: Declare UTF-8 charset on POSTed parameters
    to avoid problems with servlet containers that default to latin-1
    and allow switching of the exact POST mechanism for parameters
    via useMultiPartPost in CommonsHttpSolrServer.
    (Lars Kotthoff, Andrew Schurman, ryan, yonik)

40. SOLR-556: multi-valued fields always highlighted in disparate snippets
    (Lars Kotthoff via klaas)

    multicore sharedLib or core's lib directory.
    (Walter Ferrara, Noble Paul, shalin)

    It does not have lucene or junit dependencies.  The original classes
    have been replaced with a @Deprecated extended class and are scheduled
    to be removed in a later release.  While this change does not affect API
    compatibility, it is recommended to update references to these
    deprecated classes.  (ryan)

              client and contrib. The target can publish artifacts with source and javadocs.
              (Spencer Crissman, Craig McClanahan, shalin)

================== Release 1.2 ==================

Upgrading from Solr 1.1
-------------------------------------
IMPORTANT UPGRADE NOTE: In a master/slave configuration, all searchers/slaves
should be upgraded before the master!  If the master were to be updated
first, the older searchers would not be able to read the new index format.

Older Apache Solr installations can be upgraded by replacing
the relevant war file with the new version.  No changes to configuration
files should be needed.

This version of Solr contains a new version of Lucene implementing
an updated index format.  This version of Solr/Lucene can still read
and update indexes in the older formats, and will convert them to the new
format on the first index change.  One change in the new index format
is that all "norms" are kept in a single file, greatly reducing the number
of files per segment. Users of compound file indexes will want to consider
converting to the non-compound format for faster indexing and slightly better
search concurrency.

The JSON response format for facets has changed to make it easier for
clients to retain sorted order.  Use json.nl=map explicitly in clients
to get the old behavior, or add it as a default to the request handler
in solrconfig.xml

The Lucene based Solr query syntax is slightly more strict.
A ':' in a field value must be escaped or the whole value must be quoted.

The Solr "Request Handler" framework has been updated in two key ways:
First, if a Request Handler is registered in solrconfig.xml with a name
starting with "/" then it can be accessed using path-based URL, instead of
using the legacy "/select?qt=name" URL structure.  Second, the Request
Handler framework has been extended making it possible to write Request
Handlers that process streams of data for doing updates, and there is a
new-style Request Handler for XML updates given the name of "/update" in
the example solrconfig.xml.  Existing installations without this "/update"
handler will continue to use the old update servlet and should see no
changes in behavior.  For new-style update handlers, errors are now
reflected in the HTTP status code, Content-type checking is more strict,
and the response format has changed and is controllable via the wt
parameter.



Detailed Change List
--------------------

New Features
 1. SOLR-82: Default field values can be specified in the schema.xml.
    (Ryan McKinley via hossman)

 2. SOLR-89: Two new TokenFilters with corresponding Factories...
    * TrimFilter - Trims leading and trailing whitespace from Tokens
    * PatternReplaceFilter - applies a Pattern to each token in the
      stream, replacing match occurances with a specified replacement.
    (hossman)

 3. SOLR-91: allow configuration of a limit of the number of searchers
    that can be warming in the background.  This can be used to avoid
    out-of-memory errors, or contention caused by more and more searchers
    warming in the background.  An error is thrown if the limit specified
    by maxWarmingSearchers in solrconfig.xml is exceeded. (yonik)

 4. SOLR-106: New faceting parameters that allow specification of a
    minimum count for returned facets (facet.mincount), paging through facets
    (facet.offset, facet.limit), and explicit sorting (facet.sort).
    facet.zeros is now deprecated.  (yonik)

 5. SOLR-80: Negative queries are now allowed everywhere.  Negative queries
    are generated and cached as their positive counterpart, speeding
    generation and generally resulting in smaller sets to cache.
    Set intersections in SolrIndexSearcher are more efficient,
    starting with the smallest positive set, subtracting all negative
    sets, then intersecting with all other positive sets.  (yonik)

 6. SOLR-117: Limit a field faceting to constraints with a prefix specified
    by facet.prefix or f.<field>.facet.prefix. (yonik)

 7. SOLR-107: JAVA API: Change NamedList to use Java5 generics
    and implement Iterable<Map.Entry> (Ryan McKinley via yonik)

 8. SOLR-104: Support for "Update Plugins" -- RequestHandlers that want
    access to streams of data for doing updates.  ContentStreams can come
    from the raw POST body, multi-part form data, or remote URLs.
    Included in this change is a new SolrDispatchFilter that allows
    RequestHandlers registered with names that begin with a "/" to be
    accessed using a URL structure based on that name.
    (Ryan McKinley via hossman)

 9. SOLR-126: DirectUpdateHandler2 supports autocommitting after a specified time
    (in ms), using <autoCommit><maxTime>10000</maxTime></autoCommit>.
    (Ryan McKinley via klaas).

10. SOLR-116: IndexInfoRequestHandler added. (Erik Hatcher)

11. SOLR-79: Add system property ${<sys.prop>[:<default>]} substitution for
    configuration files loaded, including schema.xml and solrconfig.xml.
    (Erik Hatcher with inspiration from Andrew Saar)

12. SOLR-149: Changes to make Solr more easily embeddable, in addition
    to logging which request handler handled each request.
    (Ryan McKinley via yonik)

13. SOLR-86: Added standalone Java-based command-line updater.
    (Erik Hatcher via Bertrand Delecretaz)

14. SOLR-152: DisMaxRequestHandler now supports configurable alternate
    behavior when q is not specified.  A "q.alt" param can be specified
    using SolrQueryParser syntax as a mechanism for specifying what query
    the dismax handler should execute if the main user query (q) is blank.
    (Ryan McKinley via hossman)

15. SOLR-158: new "qs" (Query Slop) param for DisMaxRequestHandler
    allows for specifying the amount of default slop to use when parsing
    explicit phrase queries from the user.
    (Adam Hiatt via hossman)

16. SOLR-81: SpellCheckerRequestHandler that uses the SpellChecker from
    the Lucene contrib.
    (Otis Gospodnetic and Adam Hiatt)

17. SOLR-182: allow lazy loading of request handlers on first request.
    (Ryan McKinley via yonik)

18. SOLR-81: More SpellCheckerRequestHandler enhancements, inlcluding
    support for relative or absolute directory path configurations, as
    well as RAM based directory. (hossman)

19. SOLR-197: New parameters for input: stream.contentType for specifying
    or overriding the content type of input, and stream.file for reading
    local files. (Ryan McKinley via yonik)

20. SOLR-66: CSV data format for document additions and updates. (yonik)

21. SOLR-184: add echoHandler=true to responseHeader, support echoParams=all
    (Ryan McKinley via ehatcher)

22. SOLR-211: Added a regex PatternTokenizerFactory.  This extracts tokens
    from the input string using a regex Pattern. (Ryan McKinley)

23. SOLR-162: Added a "Luke" request handler and other admin helpers.
    This exposes the system status through the standard requestHandler
    framework. (ryan)

24. SOLR-212: Added a DirectSolrConnection class.  This lets you access
    solr using the standard request/response formats, but does not require
    an HTTP connection.  It is designed for embedded applications. (ryan)

25. SOLR-204: The request dispatcher (added in SOLR-104) can handle
    calls to /select.  This offers uniform error handling for /update and
    /select.  To enable this behavior, you must add:
      <requestDispatcher handleSelect="true" > to your solrconfig.xml
    See the example solrconfig.xml for details.  (ryan)

26. SOLR-170: StandardRequestHandler now supports a "sort" parameter.
    Using the ';' syntax is still supported, but it is recommended to
    transition to the new syntax. (ryan)

27. SOLR-181: The index schema now supports "required" fields.  Attempts
    to add a document without a required field will fail, returning a
    descriptive error message.  By default, the uniqueKey field is
    a required field.  This can be disabled by setting required=false
    in schema.xml.  (Greg Ludington via ryan)

28. SOLR-217: Fields configured in the schema to be neither indexed or
    stored will now be quietly ignored by Solr when Documents are added.
    The example schema has a comment explaining how this can be used to
    ignore any "unknown" fields.
    (Will Johnson via hossman)

29. SOLR-227: If schema.xml defines multiple fieldTypes, fields, or
    dynamicFields with the same name, a severe error will be logged rather
    then quietly continuing. Depending on the <abortOnConfigurationError>
    settings, this may halt the server.  Likewise, if solrconfig.xml
    defines multiple RequestHandlers with the same name it will also add
    an error.  (ryan)

30. SOLR-226: Added support for dynamic field as the destination of a
    copyField using glob (*) replacement. (ryan)

31. SOLR-224: Adding a PhoneticFilterFactory that uses apache commons codec
    language encoders to build phonetically similar tokens.  This currently
    supports: DoubleMetaphone, Metaphone, Soundex, and RefinedSoundex (ryan)

32. SOLR-199: new n-gram tokenizers available via NGramTokenizerFactory
    and EdgeNGramTokenizerFactory. (Adam Hiatt via yonik)

33. SOLR-234: TrimFilter can update the Token's startOffset and endOffset
    if updateOffsets="true".  By default the Token offsets are unchanged.
    (ryan)

34. SOLR-208: new example_rss.xsl and example_atom.xsl to provide more
    examples for people about the Solr XML response format and how they
    can transform it to suit different needs.
    (Brian Whitman via hossman)

35. SOLR-249: Deprecated SolrException( int, ... ) constructors in favor
    of constructors that takes an ErrorCode enum.  This will ensure that
    all SolrExceptions use a valid HTTP status code. (ryan)

36. SOLR-386: Abstracted SolrHighlighter and moved existing implementation
    to DefaultSolrHighlighter.  Adjusted SolrCore and solrconfig.xml so
    that highlighter is configurable via a class attribute.  Allows users
    to use their own highlighter implementation. (Tricia Williams via klaas)

Changes in runtime behavior
 1. Highlighting using DisMax will only pick up terms from the main
    user query, not boost or filter queries (klaas).

 2. SOLR-125: Change default of json.nl to flat, change so that
    json.nl only affects items where order matters (facet constraint
    listings).  Fix JSON output bug for null values.  Internal JAVA API:
    change most uses of NamedList to SimpleOrderedMap. (yonik)

 3. A new method "getSolrQueryParser" has been added to the IndexSchema
    class for retrieving a new SolrQueryParser instance with all options
    specified in the schema.xml's <solrQueryParser> block set.  The
    documentation for the SolrQueryParser constructor and its use of
    IndexSchema have also been clarified.
    (Erik Hatcher and hossman)

 4. DisMaxRequestHandler's bq, bf, qf, and pf parameters can now accept
    multiple values (klaas).

 5. Query are re-written before highlighting is performed.  This enables
    proper highlighting of prefix and wildcard queries (klaas).

 6. A meaningful exception is raised when attempting to add a doc missing
    a unique id if it is declared in the schema and allowDups=false.
    (ryan via klaas)

 7. SOLR-183: Exceptions with error code 400 are raised when
    numeric argument parsing fails.  RequiredSolrParams class added
    to facilitate checking for parameters that must be present.
    (Ryan McKinley, J.J. Larrea via yonik)

 8. SOLR-179: By default, solr will abort after any severe initialization
    errors.  This behavior can be disabled by setting:
    <abortOnConfigurationError>false</abortOnConfigurationError>
    in solrconfig.xml (ryan)

 9. The example solrconfig.xml maps /update to XmlUpdateRequestHandler using
    the new request dispatcher (SOLR-104).  This requires posted content to
    have a valid contentType: curl -H 'Content-type:text/xml; charset=utf-8'
    The response format matches that of /select and returns standard error
    codes.  To enable solr1.1 style /update, do not map "/update" to any
    handler in solrconfig.xml (ryan)

10. SOLR-231: If a charset is not specified in the contentType,
    ContentStream.getReader() will use UTF-8 encoding.  (ryan)

11. SOLR-230: More options for post.jar to support stdin, xml on the
    commandline, and defering commits.  Tutorial modified to take
    advantage of these options so there is no need for curl.
    (hossman)

12. SOLR-128: Upgraded Jetty to the latest stable release 6.1.3 (ryan)

Optimizations
 1. SOLR-114: HashDocSet specific implementations of union() and andNot()
    for a 20x performance improvement for those set operations, and a new
    hash algorithm speeds up exists() by 10% and intersectionSize() by 8%.
    (yonik)

 2. SOLR-115: Solr now uses BooleanQuery.clauses() instead of
    BooleanQuery.getClauses() in any situation where there is no risk of
    modifying the original query.
    (hossman)

 3. SOLR-221: Speed up sorted faceting on multivalued fields by ~60%
    when the base set consists of a relatively large portion of the
    index. (yonik)

 4. SOLR-221: Added a facet.enum.cache.minDf parameter which avoids
    using the filterCache for terms that match few documents, trading
    decreased memory usage for increased query time. (yonik)

Bug Fixes
 1. SOLR-87: Parsing of synonym files did not correctly handle escaped
    whitespace such as \r\n\t\b\f. (yonik)

 2. SOLR-92: DOMUtils.getText (used when parsing config files) did not
    work properly with many DOM implementations when dealing with
    "Attributes". (Ryan McKinley via hossman)

 3. SOLR-9,SOLR-99: Tighten up sort specification error checking, throw
    exceptions for missing sort specifications or a sort on a non-indexed
    field. (Ryan McKinley via yonik)

 4. SOLR-145: Fix for bug introduced in SOLR-104 where some Exceptions
    were being ignored by all "out of the box" RequestHandlers. (hossman)

 5. SOLR-166: JNDI solr.home code refactoring.  SOLR-104 moved
    some JNDI related code to the init method of a Servlet Filter -
    according to the Servlet Spec, all Filter's should be initialized
    prior to initializing any Servlets, but this is not the case in at
    least one Servlet Container (Resin).  This "bug fix" refactors
    this JNDI code so that it should be executed the first time any
    attempt is made to use the solr.home dir.
    (Ryan McKinley via hossman)

 6. SOLR-173: Bug fix to SolrDispatchFilter to reduce "too many open
    files" problem was that SolrDispatchFilter was not closing requests
    when finished.  Also modified ResponseWriters to only fetch a Searcher
    reference if necessary for writing out DocLists.
    (Ryan McKinley via hossman)

 7. SOLR-168: Fix display positioning of multiple tokens at the same
    position in analysis.jsp (yonik)

 8. SOLR-167: The SynonymFilter sometimes generated incorrect offsets when
    multi token synonyms were mached in the source text. (yonik)

 9. SOLR-188: bin scripts do not support non-default webapp names.  Added "-U"
    option to specify a full path to the update url, overriding the
    "-h" (hostname), "-p" (port) and "-w" (webapp name) parameters.
    (Jeff Rodenburg via billa)

10. SOLR-198: RunExecutableListener always waited for the process to
    finish, even when wait="false" was set. (Koji Sekiguchi via yonik)

11. SOLR-207: Changed distribution scripts to remove recursive find
    and avoid use of "find -maxdepth" on platforms where it is not
    supported. (yonik)

12. SOLR-222: Changing writeLockTimeout in solrconfig.xml did not
    change the effective timeout. (Koji Sekiguchi via yonik)

13. Changed the SOLR-104 RequestDispatcher so that /select?qt=xxx can not
    access handlers that start with "/".  This makes path based authentication
    possible for path based request handlers.  (ryan)

14. SOLR-214: Some servlet containers (including Tomcat and Resin) do not
    obey the specified charset.  Rather then letting the the container handle
    it solr now uses the charset from the header contentType to decode posted
    content.  Using the contentType: "text/xml; charset=utf-8" will force
    utf-8 encoding.  If you do not specify a contentType, it will use the
    platform default.  (Koji Sekiguchi via ryan)

15. SOLR-241: Undefined system properties used in configuration files now
    cause a clear message to be logged rather than an obscure exception thrown.
    (Koji Sekiguchi via ehatcher)

Other Changes
 1. Updated to Lucene 2.1

 2. Updated to Lucene 2007-05-20_00-04-53

================== Release 1.1.0 ==================

Status
------
This is the first release since Solr joined the Incubator, and brings many
new features and performance optimizations including highlighting,
faceted browsing, and JSON/Python/Ruby response formats.


Upgrading from previous Solr versions
-------------------------------------
Older Apache Solr installations can be upgraded by replacing
the relevant war file with the new version.  No changes to configuration
files are needed and the index format has not changed.

The default version of the Solr XML response syntax has been changed to 2.2.
Behavior can be preserved for those clients not explicitly specifying a
version by adding a default to the request handler in solrconfig.xml

By default, Solr will no longer use a searcher that has not fully warmed,
and requests will block in the meantime.  To change back to the previous
behavior of using a cold searcher in the event there is no other
warm searcher, see the useColdSearcher config item in solrconfig.xml

The XML response format when adding multiple documents to the collection
in a single <add> command has changed to return a single <result>.


Detailed Change List
--------------------

New Features
 1. added support for setting Lucene's positionIncrementGap
 2. Admin: new statistics for SolrIndexSearcher
 3. Admin: caches now show config params on stats page
 3. max() function added to FunctionQuery suite
 4. postOptimize hook, mirroring the functionallity of the postCommit hook,
    but only called on an index optimize.
 5. Ability to HTTP POST query requests to /select in addition to HTTP-GET
 6. The default search field may now be overridden by requests to the
    standard request handler using the df query parameter. (Erik Hatcher)
 7. Added DisMaxRequestHandler and SolrPluginUtils. (Chris Hostetter)
 8. Support for customizing the QueryResponseWriter per request
    (Mike Baranczak / SOLR-16 / hossman)
 9. Added KeywordTokenizerFactory (hossman)
10. copyField accepts dynamicfield-like names as the source.
    (Darren Erik Vengroff via yonik, SOLR-21)
11. new DocSet.andNot(), DocSet.andNotSize() (yonik)
12. Ability to store term vectors for fields. (Mike Klaas via yonik, SOLR-23)
13. New abstract BufferedTokenStream for people who want to write
    Tokenizers or TokenFilters that require arbitrary buffering of the
    stream. (SOLR-11 / yonik, hossman)
14. New RemoveDuplicatesToken - useful in situations where
    synonyms, stemming, or word-deliminater-ing produce identical tokens at
    the same position. (SOLR-11 / yonik, hossman)
15. Added highlighting to SolrPluginUtils and implemented in StandardRequestHandler
    and DisMaxRequestHandler (SOLR-24 / Mike Klaas via hossman,yonik)
16. SnowballPorterFilterFactory language is configurable via the "language"
    attribute, with the default being "English".  (Bertrand Delacretaz via yonik, SOLR-27)
17. ISOLatin1AccentFilterFactory, instantiates ISOLatin1AccentFilter to remove accents.
    (Bertrand Delacretaz via yonik, SOLR-28)
18. JSON, Python, Ruby QueryResponseWriters: use wt="json", "python" or "ruby"
    (yonik, SOLR-31)
19. Make web admin pages return UTF-8, change Content-type declaration to include a
    space between the mime-type and charset (Philip Jacob, SOLR-35)
20. Made query parser default operator configurable via schema.xml:
         <solrQueryParser defaultOperator="AND|OR"/>
    The default operator remains "OR".
21. JAVA API: new version of SolrIndexSearcher.getDocListAndSet() which takes
    flags (Greg Ludington via yonik, SOLR-39)
22. A HyphenatedWordsFilter, a text analysis filter used during indexing to rejoin
    words that were hyphenated and split by a newline. (Boris Vitez via yonik, SOLR-41)
23. Added a CompressableField base class which allows fields of derived types to
    be compressed using the compress=true setting.  The field type also gains the
    ability to specify a size threshold at which field data is compressed.
    (klaas, SOLR-45)
24. Simple faceted search support for fields (enumerating terms)
    and arbitrary queries added to both StandardRequestHandler and
    DisMaxRequestHandler. (hossman, SOLR-44)
25. In addition to specifying default RequestHandler params in the
    solrconfig.xml, support has been added for configuring values to be
    appended to the multi-val request params, as well as for configuring
    invariant params that can not overridden in the query. (hossman, SOLR-46)
26. Default operator for query parsing can now be specified with q.op=AND|OR
    from the client request, overriding the schema value. (ehatcher)
27. New XSLTResponseWriter does server side XSLT processing of XML Response.
    In the process, an init(NamedList) method was added to QueryResponseWriter
    which works the same way as SolrRequestHandler.
    (Bertrand Delacretaz / SOLR-49 / hossman)
28. json.wrf parameter adds a wrapper-function around the JSON response,
    useful in AJAX with dynamic script tags for specifying a JavaScript
    callback function. (Bertrand Delacretaz via yonik, SOLR-56)
29. autoCommit can be specified every so many documents added (klaas, SOLR-65)
30. ${solr.home}/lib directory can now be used for specifying "plugin" jars
    (hossman, SOLR-68)
31. Support for "Date Math" relative "NOW" when specifying values of a
    DateField in a query -- or when adding a document.
    (hossman, SOLR-71)
32. useColdSearcher control in solrconfig.xml prevents the first searcher
    from being used before it's done warming.  This can help prevent
    thrashing on startup when multiple requests hit a cold searcher.
    The default is "false", preventing use before warm. (yonik, SOLR-77)

Changes in runtime behavior
 1. classes reorganized into different packages, package names changed to Apache
 2. force read of document stored fields in QuerySenderListener
 3. Solr now looks in ./solr/conf for config, ./solr/data for data
    configurable via solr.solr.home system property
 4. Highlighter params changed to be prefixed with "hl."; allow fragmentsize
    customization and per-field overrides on many options
    (Andrew May via klaas, SOLR-37)
 5. Default param values for DisMaxRequestHandler should now be specified
    using a '<lst name="defaults">...</lst>' init param, for backwards
    compatability all init prams will be used as defaults if an init param
    with that name does not exist. (hossman, SOLR-43)
 6. The DisMaxRequestHandler now supports multiple occurances of the "fq"
    param. (hossman, SOLR-44)
 7. FunctionQuery.explain now uses ComplexExplanation to provide more
    accurate score explanations when composed in a BooleanQuery.
    (hossman, SOLR-25)
 8. Document update handling locking is much sparser, allowing performance gains
    through multiple threads.  Large commits also might be faster (klaas, SOLR-65)
 9. Lazy field loading can be enabled via a solrconfig directive.  This will be faster when
    not all stored fields are needed from a document (klaas, SOLR-52)
10. Made admin JSPs return XML and transform them with new XSL stylesheets
    (Otis Gospodnetic, SOLR-58)
11. If the "echoParams=explicit" request parameter is set, request parameters are copied
    to the output. In an XML output, they appear in new <lst name="params"> list inside
    the new <lst name="responseHeader"> element, which replaces the old <responseHeader>.
    Adding a version=2.1 parameter to the request produces the old format, for backwards
    compatibility (bdelacretaz and yonik, SOLR-59).

Optimizations
 1. getDocListAndSet can now generate both a DocList and a DocSet from a
    single lucene query.
 2. BitDocSet.intersectionSize(HashDocSet) no longer generates an intermediate
    set
 3. OpenBitSet completed, replaces BitSet as the implementation for BitDocSet.
    Iteration is faster, and BitDocSet.intersectionSize(BitDocSet) and unionSize
    is between 3 and 4 times faster. (yonik, SOLR-15)
 4. much faster unionSize when one of the sets is a HashDocSet: O(smaller_set_size)
 5. Optimized getDocSet() for term queries resulting in a 36% speedup of facet.field
    queries where DocSets aren't cached (for example, if the number of terms in the field
    is larger than the filter cache.) (yonik)
 6. Optimized facet.field faceting by as much as 500 times when the field has
    a single token per document (not multiValued & not tokenized) by using the
    Lucene FieldCache entry for that field to tally term counts.  The first request
    utilizing the FieldCache will take longer than subsequent ones.

Bug Fixes
 1. Fixed delete-by-id for field types who's indexed form is different
    from the printable form (mainly sortable numeric types).
 2. Added escaping of attribute values in the XML response (Erik Hatcher)
 3. Added empty extractTerms() to FunctionQuery to enable use in
    a MultiSearcher (Yonik)
 4. WordDelimiterFilter sometimes lost token positionIncrement information
 5. Fix reverse sorting for fields were sortMissingFirst=true
    (Rob Staveley, yonik)
 6. Worked around a Jetty bug that caused invalid XML responses for fields
    containing non ASCII chars.  (Bertrand Delacretaz via yonik, SOLR-32)
 7. WordDelimiterFilter can throw exceptions if configured with both
    generate and catenate off.  (Mike Klaas via yonik, SOLR-34)
 8. Escape '>' in XML output (because ]]> is illegal in CharData)
 9. field boosts weren't being applied and doc boosts were being applied to fields (klaas)
10. Multiple-doc update generates well-formed xml (klaas, SOLR-65)
11. Better parsing of pingQuery from solrconfig.xml (hossman, SOLR-70)
12. Fixed bug with "Distribution" page introduced when Versions were
    added to "Info" page (hossman)
13. Fixed HTML escaping issues with user input to analysis.jsp and action.jsp
    (hossman, SOLR-74)

    (Alexander Saar via hossman, SOLR-78)

2006/01/17 Solr open sourced, moves to Apache Incubator
