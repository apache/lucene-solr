                    Apache Solr - DataImportHandler
                            Release Notes

Introduction
------------
DataImportHandler is a data import tool for Solr which makes importing data from Databases, XML files and
HTTP data sources quick and easy.


==================  3.6.2  ==================

Bug Fixes
----------------------
* SOLR-3779: DataImportHandler's LineEntityProcessor when used in conjunction 
  with FileListEntityProcessor would only process the first file.
  (Ahmet Arslan via James Dyer)
  
* SOLR-3791: CachedSqlEntityProcessor would throw a NullPointerException when 
  a query returns a row with a NULL key.  (Steffen Moelter via James Dyer)
  
* SOLR-3850: DataImportHandler "cacheKey" parameter was incorrectly renamed "cachePk"
  (James Dyer)

==================  3.6.1 ==================

Bug Fixes
----------------------
* SOLR-3360: More bug fixes for the deprecated "threads" parameter.  (Mikhail Khludnev, Claudio R, via James Dyer)

* SOLR-3430: Added a new test against a real SQL database.  Fixed problems revealed by this new test
             related to the expanded cache support added to 3.6/SOLR-2382 (James Dyer)

* SOLR-3336: SolrEntityProcessor substitutes most variables at query time.
             (Michael Kroh, Lance Norskog, via Martijn van Groningen)

==================  3.6.0 ==================

New Features
----------------------
* SOLR-1499: Added SolrEntityProcessor that imports data from another Solr core or instance based on a specified query.
             (Lance Norskog, Erik Hatcher, Pulkit Singhal, Ahmet Arslan, Luca Cavanna, Martijn van Groningen)
             Additional Work:
             SOLR-3190: Minor improvements to SolrEntityProcessor. Add more consistency between solr parameters
             and parameters used in SolrEntityProcessor and ability to specify a custom HttpClient instance.
             (Luca Cavanna via Martijn van Groningen)
* SOLR-2382: Added pluggable cache support so that any Entity can be made cache-able by adding the "cacheImpl" parameter.
             Include "SortedMapBackedCache" to provide in-memory caching (as previously this was the only option when
             using CachedSqlEntityProcessor).  Users can provide their own implementations of DIHCache for other
             caching strategies.  Deprecate CachedSqlEntityProcessor in favor of specifing "cacheImpl" with
             SqlEntityProcessor.  Make SolrWriter implement DIHWriter and allow the possibility of pluggable Writers
             (DIH writing to something other than Solr).  (James Dyer, Noble Paul)

Changes in Runtime Behavior
----------------------
* SOLR-3142: Imports no longer default optimize to true, instead false. If you want to force all segments to be merged
             into one, you can specify this parameter yourself. NOTE: this can be very expensive operation and usually
             does not make sense for delta-imports.  (Robert MUir)

==================  3.5.0 ==================

Bug Fixes
----------------------
* SOLR-2875: Fix the incorrect url in tika-data-config.xml (Shinichiro Abe via koji)

* SOLR-3011 / SOLR-3307: Extensive bug fixes for "threads" parameter.  Also added deprecation a warning when using
                          "threads".  (Mikhail Khludnev, Bernd Fehling, James Dyer)

==================  3.4.0 ==================

Bug Fixes
----------------------
* SOLR-2644: When using threads=2 the default logging is set too high (Bill Bell via shalin)
* SOLR-2492: DIH does not commit if only deletes are processed (James Dyer via shalin)
* SOLR-2186: DataImportHandler's multi-threaded option throws NPE (Lance Norskog, Frank Wesemann, shalin)
* SOLR-2655: DIH multi threaded mode does not resolve attributes correctly (Frank Wesemann, shalin)
* SOLR-2695: Documents are collected in unsynchronized list in multi-threaded debug mode (Michael McCandless, shalin)
* SOLR-2668: DIH multithreaded mode does not rollback on errors from EntityProcessor (Frank Wesemann, shalin)

==================  3.3.0 ==================

* SOLR-2551: Check dataimport.properties for write access (if delta-import is supported
  in DIH configuration) before starting an import (C S, shalin)

==================  3.2.0 ==================

(No Changes)

Build
----------------------


Documentation
----------------------

================== Release 1.4.0 ==================

Upgrading from Solr 1.3
-----------------------

Evaluator API has been changed in a non back-compatible way. Users who have developed custom Evaluators will need
to change their code according to the new API for it to work. See SOLR-996 for details.

The formatDate evaluator's syntax has been changed. The new syntax is formatDate(<variable>, '<format_string>').
For example, formatDate(x.date, 'yyyy-MM-dd'). In the old syntax, the date string was written without a single-quotes.
The old syntax has been deprecated and will be removed in 1.5, until then, using the old syntax will log a warning.

The Context API has been changed in a non back-compatible way. In particular, the Context.currentProcess() method
now returns a String describing the type of the current import process instead of an int. Similarily, the public
constants in Context viz. FULL_DUMP, DELTA_DUMP and FIND_DELTA are changed to a String type. See SOLR-969 for details.

The EntityProcessor API has been simplified by moving logic for applying transformers and handling multi-row outputs
from Transformers into an EntityProcessorWrapper class. The EntityProcessor#destroy is now called once per
parent-row at the end of row (end of data). A new method EntityProcessor#close is added which is called at the end
of import.

In Solr 1.3, if the last_index_time was not available (first import) and a delta-import was requested, a full-import
was run instead. This is no longer the case. In Solr 1.4 delta import is run with last_index_time as the epoch
date (January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 GMT) if last_index_time is not available.

Detailed Change List
----------------------

New Features
----------------------
1. SOLR-768:  Set last_index_time variable in full-import command.
              (Wojtek Piaseczny, Noble Paul via shalin)

              for processing with transformers and child entities.
              (Fergus McMenemie, Noble Paul, shalin)

31.SOLR-1127: Add support for field name to be templatized.
              (Noble Paul, shalin)

32.SOLR-1092: Added a new command named 'import' which does not automatically clean the index. This is useful and
              more appropriate when one needs to import only some of the entities.
              (Noble Paul via shalin)
              
33.SOLR-1153: 'deltaImportQuery' is honored on child entities as well (noble) 

34.SOLR-1230: Enhanced dataimport.jsp to work with all DataImportHandler request handler configurations,

Other
----------------------
1. SOLR-782:  Refactored SolrWriter to make it a concrete class and removed wrappers over SolrInputDocument.
              Refactored to load Evaluators lazily. Removed multiple document nodes in the configuration xml.
              Removed support for 'default' variables, they are automatically available as request parameters.

--------------------

New Features
1. SOLR-700:  Allow configurable locales through a locale attribute in fields for NumberFormatTransformer.
              (Stefan Oestreicher, shalin)

Changes in runtime behavior

Bug Fixes
1. SOLR-704:  NumberFormatTransformer can silently ignore part of the string while parsing. Now it tries to
              use the complete string for parsing. Failure to do so will result in an exception.
              (Stefan Oestreicher via shalin)

2. SOLR-729:  Context.getDataSource(String) gives current entity's DataSource instance regardless of argument.
              (Noble Paul, shalin)

3. SOLR-726:  Jdbc Drivers and DataSources fail to load if placed in multicore sharedLib or core's lib directory.
              (Walter Ferrara, Noble Paul, shalin)
