Apache Solr Search Server: Learning to Rank Contrib

<p>
This module contains a logic <strong>to plug machine learned ranking modules into Solr</strong>.
</p>
<p>
In information retrieval systems, Learning to Rank is used to re-rank the top X
retrieved documents using trained machine learning models. The hope is
that sophisticated models can make more nuanced ranking decisions than standard ranking
functions like TF-IDF or BM25.
</p>
<p>
This module allows to plug a reranking model directly into Solr, enabling users
to easily build their own learning to rank systems and access the rich
matching features readily available in Solr. It also provides tools to perform
feature engineering and feature extraction.
</p>
<h2> Code structure </h2>
<p>
A Learning to Rank model is plugged into the ranking through the {@link org.apache.solr.ltr.search.LTRQParserPlugin},
a {@link org.apache.solr.search.QParserPlugin}. The plugin will
read from the request the model (instance of {@link org.apache.solr.ltr.model.LTRScoringModel})
used to perform the request plus other
parameters. The plugin will generate a {@link org.apache.solr.ltr.search.LTRQParserPlugin.LTRQuery LTRQuery}:
a particular {@link org.apache.solr.search.RankQuery}
that will encapsulate the given model and use it to
rescore and rerank the document (by using an {@link org.apache.solr.ltr.LTRRescorer}).
</p>
<p>
A model will be applied on each document through a {@link org.apache.solr.ltr.LTRScoringQuery}, a
subclass of {@link org.apache.lucene.search.Query}. As a normal query,
the learned model will produce a new score
for each document reranked.
</p>
<p>
A {@link org.apache.solr.ltr.LTRScoringQuery} is created by providing an instance of
{@link org.apache.solr.ltr.model.LTRScoringModel}. An instance of
{@link org.apache.solr.ltr.model.LTRScoringModel}
defines how to combine the features in order to create a new
score for a document. A new learning to rank model is plugged
into the framework  by extending {@link org.apache.solr.ltr.model.LTRScoringModel},
(see for example {@link org.apache.solr.ltr.model.MultipleAdditiveTreesModel} and {@link org.apache.solr.ltr.model.LinearModel}).
</p>
<p>
The {@link org.apache.solr.ltr.LTRScoringQuery} will take care of computing the values of
all the features (see {@link org.apache.solr.ltr.feature.Feature}) and then will delegate the final score
generation to the {@link org.apache.solr.ltr.model.LTRScoringModel}, by calling the method
{@link org.apache.solr.ltr.model.LTRScoringModel#score(float[] modelFeatureValuesNormalized)}.
</p>
<p>
A {@link org.apache.solr.ltr.feature.Feature} will produce a particular value for each document, so
it is modeled as a {@link org.apache.lucene.search.Query}. The package
{@link org.apache.solr.ltr.feature} contains several examples
of features. One benefit of extending the Query object is that we can reuse
Query as a feature, see for example {@link org.apache.solr.ltr.feature.SolrFeature}.
Features for a document can also be returned in the response by
using the FeatureTransformer (a {@link org.apache.solr.response.transform.DocTransformer DocTransformer})
provided by {@link org.apache.solr.ltr.response.transform.LTRFeatureLoggerTransformerFactory}.
</p>
<p>
{@link org.apache.solr.ltr.store} contains all the logic to store all the features and the models.
Models are registered into a unique {@link org.apache.solr.ltr.store.ModelStore ModelStore},
and each model specifies a particular {@link org.apache.solr.ltr.store.FeatureStore FeatureStore} that
will contain a particular subset of features.
<p>
</p>
Features and models can be managed through a REST API, provided by the
{@link org.apache.solr.rest.ManagedResource Managed Resources}
{@link org.apache.solr.ltr.store.rest.ManagedFeatureStore ManagedFeatureStore}
and {@link org.apache.solr.ltr.store.rest.ManagedModelStore ManagedModelStore}.
