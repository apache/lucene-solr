Solr Version Control System
 
Overview
 
The Solr source code resides in the Apache Subversion (SVN) repository.
The command-line SVN client can be obtained here or as an optional package
for cygwin.

The TortoiseSVN GUI client for Windows can be obtained here. There
are also SVN plugins available for older versions of Eclipse and 
IntelliJ IDEA that don't have subversion support already included.
