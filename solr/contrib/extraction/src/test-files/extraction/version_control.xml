      <p>
        The Solr source code resides in the Apache <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">Subversion (SVN)</a> repository.
        The command-line SVN client can be obtained <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/project_packages.html">here</a> or as an optional package for <a href="http://www.cygwin.com/">cygwin</a>.
        The TortoiseSVN GUI client for Windows can be obtained <a href="http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/">here</a>. There
        are also SVN plugins available for older versions of <a href="http://subclipse.tigris.org/">Eclipse</a> and 
        <a href="http://svnup.tigris.org/">IntelliJ IDEA</a> that don't have subversion support already included.
