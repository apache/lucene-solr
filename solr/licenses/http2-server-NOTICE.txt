<h3>Usage Of Content</h3>

<p>THE ECLIPSE FOUNDATION MAKES AVAILABLE SOFTWARE, DOCUMENTATION, INFORMATION AND/OR OTHER MATERIALS FOR OPEN SOURCE PROJECTS
   (COLLECTIVELY "CONTENT").  USE OF THE CONTENT IS GOVERNED BY THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT AND/OR THE TERMS AND
   CONDITIONS OF LICENSE AGREEMENTS OR NOTICES INDICATED OR REFERENCED BELOW.  BY USING THE CONTENT, YOU AGREE THAT YOUR USE
   OF THE CONTENT IS GOVERNED BY THIS AGREEMENT AND/OR THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF ANY APPLICABLE LICENSE AGREEMENTS OR
   NOTICES INDICATED OR REFERENCED BELOW.  IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT AND THE TERMS AND
   CONDITIONS OF ANY APPLICABLE LICENSE AGREEMENTS OR NOTICES INDICATED OR REFERENCED BELOW, THEN YOU MAY NOT USE THE CONTENT.</p>
   
<h3>Applicable Licenses</h3>   
   
<p>Unless otherwise indicated, all Content made available by the
Eclipse Foundation is provided to you under the terms and conditions of
the Eclipse Public License Version 1.0 ("EPL"). A copy of the EPL is
provided with this Content and is also available at <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/legal/epl-v10.html">http://www.eclipse.org/legal/epl-v10.html</a>.
   For purposes of the EPL, "Program" will mean the Content.</p>

<p>Content includes, but is not limited to, source code, object code,
documentation and other files maintained in the Eclipse.org CVS
repository ("Repository") in CVS modules ("Modules") and made available
as downloadable archives ("Downloads").</p>
   
<ul>
	<li>Content may be structured and packaged into modules to
facilitate delivering, extending, and upgrading the Content. Typical
modules may include plug-ins ("Plug-ins"), plug-in fragments
("Fragments"), and features ("Features").</li>
	<li>Each Plug-in or Fragment may be packaged as a sub-directory or JAR (Java&#8482; ARchive) in a directory named "plugins".</li>
	<li>A
Feature is a bundle of one or more Plug-ins and/or Fragments and
associated material. Each Feature may be packaged as a sub-directory in
a directory named "features". Within a Feature, files named
"feature.xml" may contain a list of the names and version numbers of
the Plug-ins and/or Fragments associated with that Feature.</li>
	<li>Features
may also include other Features ("Included Features"). Within a
Feature, files named "feature.xml" may contain a list of the names and
version numbers of Included Features.</li>
</ul>   
 
<p>The terms and conditions governing Plug-ins and Fragments should be
contained in files named "about.html" ("Abouts"). The terms and
conditions governing Features and
Included Features should be contained in files named "license.html"
("Feature Licenses"). Abouts and Feature Licenses may be located in any
directory of a Download or Module
including, but not limited to the following locations:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The top-level (root) directory</li>
	<li>Plug-in and Fragment directories</li>
	<li>Inside Plug-ins and Fragments packaged as JARs</li>
	<li>Sub-directories of the directory named "src" of certain Plug-ins</li>
	<li>Feature directories</li>
</ul>
		
<p>Note: if a Feature made available by the Eclipse Foundation is
installed using the Eclipse Update Manager, you must agree to a license
("Feature Update License") during the
installation process. If the Feature contains Included Features, the
Feature Update License should either provide you with the terms and
conditions governing the Included Features or
inform you where you can locate them. Feature Update Licenses may be
found in the "license" property of files named "feature.properties"
found within a Feature.
Such Abouts, Feature Licenses, and Feature Update Licenses contain the
terms and conditions (or references to such terms and conditions) that
govern your use of the associated Content in
that directory.</p>

<p>THE ABOUTS, FEATURE LICENSES, AND FEATURE UPDATE LICENSES MAY REFER
TO THE EPL OR OTHER LICENSE AGREEMENTS, NOTICES OR TERMS AND
CONDITIONS. SOME OF THESE
OTHER LICENSE AGREEMENTS MAY INCLUDE (BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO):</p>

<ul>
