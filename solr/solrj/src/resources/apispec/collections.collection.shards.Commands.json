During this action, the existing shard will continue to contain the original data, but new data will be routed to the new shards once the split is complete. New shards will have as many replicas as the existing shards. A soft commit will be done automatically. An explicit commit request is not required because the index is automatically saved to disk during the split operation. New shards will use the original shard name as the basis for their names, adding an underscore and a number to differentiate the new shard. For example, 'shard1' would become 'shard1_0' and 'shard1_1'. Note that this operation can take a long time to complete.",
