/** <code>SimpleOrderedMap</code> is a {@link NamedList} where access by key is more
 * important than maintaining order when it comes to representing the
 * held data in other forms, as ResponseWriters normally do.
 * It's normally not a good idea to repeat keys or use null keys, but this
 * is not enforced.  If key uniqueness enforcement is desired, use a regular {@link Map}.
 * <p>
 * For example, a JSON response writer may choose to write a SimpleOrderedMap
 * as {"foo":10,"bar":20} and may choose to write a NamedList as
 * ["foo",10,"bar",20].  An XML response writer may choose to render both
 * the same way.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This class does not provide efficient lookup by key, its main purpose is
 * to hold data to be serialized.  It aims to minimize overhead and to be
 * efficient at adding new elements.
 * </p>
