/**
 * Takes two streams (fullStream and hashStream) and joins them similar to an LeftOuterJoinStream. The difference
 * in a OuterHashJoinStream is that the tuples in the hashStream will all be read and hashed when this stream is
 * opened. This provides a few optimizations iff the hashStream has a relatively small number of documents.
 * The difference between this and a HashJoinStream is that a tuple in the fullStream will be returned even
 * if it doesn't have any matching tuples in the hashStream. 
 * You are expected to provide a set of fields for which the hash will be calculated from. If a tuple from the 
 * hashStream does not contain a value (ie, null) for one of the fields the hash is being computed on then that 
 * tuple will not be considered a match to anything. If a tuple from the fullStream does not contain a value (ie, null) 
 * for one of the fields the hash is being computed on then that tuple will be returned without any joined tuples
 * from the hashStream
