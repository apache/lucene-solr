 This is a DEMO configuration, highlighting elements
 specifically needed to get this example running
 such as libraries and request handler specifics.

 It uses defaults or does not define most of production-level settings
 such as various caches or auto-commit policies.

 See Solr Reference Guide and other examples for
 more details on a well configured solrconfig.xml

  <!-- Controls what version of Lucene various components of Solr
    adhere to.  Generally, you want to use the latest version to
    get all bug fixes and improvements. It is highly recommended
    that you fully re-index after changing this setting as it can
    affect both how text is indexed and queried.
