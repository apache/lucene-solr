# NOTE: Flare currently does not use a database, but there are plans to eventually leverage a relational database 
#       in conjunction with Solr.  When a database is added, lib/tasks/clear_database_prerequisites.rake should be removed.

# MySQL (default setup).  Versions 4.1 and 5.0 are recommended.
#
# Install the MySQL driver:
#   gem install mysql
# On MacOS X:
#   gem install mysql -- --include=/usr/local/lib
# On Windows:
#   gem install mysql
#       Choose the win32 build.
#       Install MySQL and put its /bin directory on your path.
#
# And be sure to use new-style password hashing:

  adapter: mysql
  database: flare_development

# Warning: The database defined as 'test' will be erased and
# re-generated from your development database when you run 'rake'.
# Do not set this db to the same as development or production.

  adapter: mysql
  database: flare_test
  username: root
