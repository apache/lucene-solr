CAUSED REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY OF LIABILITY, ARISING OUT 
OF OR RELATED TO THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE SOFTWARE, 
EVEN IF SUN HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH 
DAMAGES.  In no event will Sun's liability to you, whether 
in contract, tort (including negligence), or otherwise, 
exceed the amount paid by you for Software under this 
Agreement.  The foregoing limitations will apply even if 
the above stated warranty fails of its essential purpose.

between you and Sun relating to its subject matter.  It 
supersedes all prior or contemporaneous oral or written
