Below is the license for JavaCC that you must agree to when you install
JavaCC.

We are not distributing JavaCC with the binary distribution of Lucene,
therefore, we feel that we do not need a separate license with MetaMata.
We only have a copy of the JavaCC.zip file (which contains the JavaCC
related .class files) in CVS.

Our goal is not to violate this license and do harm in any way. If you
find that we are in violation of the license, please let us know and
tell us the steps to correct our misuse.

Thanks!

The Lucene Team
