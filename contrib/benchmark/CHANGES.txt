Tests (for benchmarking code correctness) were added - LUCENE-840.
To be invoked by "ant test" from contrib/benchmark. (Doron Cohen)

2. Added traversalSize parameter to SearchTravRetTask and SearchTravTask.  Changed SearchTravRetTask to extend SearchTravTask. (GSI)
3. Added FileBasedQueryMaker to run queries from a File or resource. (GSI)
4. Modified query-maker generation for read related tasks to make further read tasks addition simpler and safer. (DC)
5. Changed Taks' setParams() to throw UnsupportedOperationException if that task does not suppot command line param. (DC)
6. Improved javadoc to specify all properties command line params currently supported. (DC)
7. Refactored ReportTasks so that it is easy/possible now to create new report tasks. (DC)

2. Added this file.

3. 2/11/07: LUCENE-790 and 788:  Fixed Locale issue with date formatter. Fixed some minor issues with benchmarking by task.  Added a dependency
 on the Lucene demo to the build classpath.  (Doron Cohen, Grant Ingersoll)
