			CachedFilter elements can contain any Query or Filter. 
			CachedFilters are cached in an LRU Cache keyed on the contained query/filter object. 
			Using this will speed up overall performance for repeated uses of the same expensive 
			query/filter. The sorts of queries likely to benefit from caching need not necessarily be 
			complex - e.g. simple TermQuerys with a large DF (document frequency) can be expensive
			on large indexes. A good example of this might be a term query on a field with only 2 possible 
			values - "true" or "false". In a large index, querying or filtering on this field requires 
			reading millions of document ids from disk which can more usefully be cached as a 
			QueryFilter bitset.
			
			For Queries/Filters to be cached and reused the object must implement hashcode and
			equals methods correctly so that duplicate queries/filters can be detected in the cache.
			
			The CoreParser.maxNumCachedFilters property can be used to control the size
			of the LRU Cache established during the construction of CoreParser instances.
