		<!-- TermsQuery uses an analyzer to tokenize text and creates a BooleanQuery with nested
			"should" TermQueries for each of the tokens encountered. This can be used for user input
			which may include content or characters that would otherwise be illegal query syntax when
			using the standard lucene query parser. Of course the downside is that none of the query 
			operators (AND NOT ~ ^ : etc) will have an effect. For some scenarios queries are
			not formed by people familiar with Lucene query syntax and they can inadvertently type illegal
			query syntax so in these cases this is an appropriate and simple alternative
