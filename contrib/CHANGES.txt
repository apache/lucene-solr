    due to recursive invocation. (Karl Wettin)

 5. LUCENE-1548: Fix distance normalization in LevenshteinDistance to
    not produce negative distances (Thomas Morton via Mike McCandless)

 6. LUCENE-1490: Fix latin1 conversion of HALFWIDTH_AND_FULLWIDTH_FORMS
    characters to only apply to the correct subset (Daniel Cheng via
    Mike McCandless)

    StandardTokenizer so that stop words with mixed case are filtered

New features

 1. LUCENE-1531: Added support for BoostingTermQuery to XML query parser. (Karl Wettin)

 2. LUCENE-1435: Added contrib/collation, a CollationKeyFilter
    allowing you to convert tokens into CollationKeys encoded usign
    IndexableBinaryStringTools.  This allows for faster RangQuery when
    a field needs to use a custom Collator.  (Steven Rowe via Mike
    McCandless)

 3. LUCENE-1591: EnWikiDocMaker, LineDocMaker, WriteLineDoc can now
    read/write bz2 using Apache commons compress library.  This means
    you can download the .bz2 export from http://wikipedia.org and
    immediately index it.  (Shai Erera via Mike McCandless)

 4. LUCENE-1629: Add SmartChineseAnalyzer to contrib/analyzers.  It
    improves on CJKAnalyzer and ChineseAnalyzer by handling Chinese
    sentences properly.  SmartChineseAnalyzer uses a Hidden Markov
    Model to tokenize Chinese words in a more intelligent way.
    (Xiaoping Gao via Mike McCandless)

 5. LUCENE-1676: Added DelimitedPayloadTokenFilter class for automatically adding payloads "in-stream" (Grant Ingersoll)

    constructor of InstantiatedIndex. (Karl Wettin)

 7. LUCENE-1704: Allow specifying the Tidy configuration file when
    parsing HTML docs with contrib/ant.  (Keith Sprochi via Mike

    Leibiusky via Mike McCandless)
