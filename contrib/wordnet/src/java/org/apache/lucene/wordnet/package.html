<title>WordNet Lucene Synonyms Integration</title>
</head>
<body>

    This package uses synonyms defined by <a href="http://www.cogsci.princeton.edu/~wn/">WordNet</a> to build a
    Lucene index storing them, which in turn can be used for query expansion.

    You normally run {@link org.apache.lucene.wordnet.Syns2Index} once to build the query index/"database", and then call
    {@link org.apache.lucene.wordnet.SynExpand#expand SynExpand.expand(...)} to expand a query.

    <p>

	<h3> Instructions </h3>
	<ol>
	    <li> Download the <a href="http://www.cogsci.princeton.edu/2.0/WNprolog-2.0.tar.gz">WordNet prolog database</a> , gunzip, untar etc.
	<li> Invoke Syn2Index as appropriate to build a synonym index.
	    It'll take 2 arguments, the path to wn_s.pl from that WordNet download, and the index name.
   
	 <li> Update your UI so that as appropriate you call SynExpand.expand(...) to expand user queries with synonyms.
       </ol>
