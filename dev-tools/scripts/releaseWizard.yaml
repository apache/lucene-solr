    Welcome to the role as Release Manager for Lucene/Solr, and the releaseWizard!

    The Release Wizard aims to walk you through the whole release process step by step,
    helping you to to run the right commands in the right order, generating
    e-mail templates for you with the correct texts, versions, paths etc, obeying
    the voting rules and much more. It also serves as a documentation of all the
    steps, with timestamps, preserving log files from each command etc.

    As you complete each step the tool will ask you if the task is complete, making
    it easy for you to know what is done and what is left to do. If you need to
    re-spin a Release Candidata (RC) the Wizard will also help.

    The Lucene project has automated much of the release process with various scripts,
    and this wizard is the glue that binds it all together.

    In the first TODO step in the checklist you will be asked to read up on the
    Apache release policy and other relevant documents before you start the release.

    NOTE: Even if we have great tooling and some degree of automation, there are
          still many manual steps and it is also important that the RM validates
          and QAs the process, validating that the right commands are run, and that
          the output from scripts are correct before proceeding.

    title: GPG key id is configured

      To sign the release you need to provide your GPG key ID. This must be
      the same key ID that you have registered in your Apache account.
      The ID is the last 8 bytes of your key fingerprint, e.g. 0D8D0B93.

      * Make sure your gpg key is 4096 bits key or larger
      * Upload your key to the MIT key server, pgp.mit.edu
      * Put you GPG key's fingerprint in the `OpenPGP Public Key Primary Fingerprint`
        field in your id.apache.org profile
      * The tests will complain if your GPG key has not been signed by another Lucene
        committer. This makes you a part of the GPG "web of trust" (WoT). Ask a committer
        that you know personally to sign your key for you, providing them with the
        fingerprint for the key.

      Do they contain all releases less than the one in progress?

    description: |-
      Send a note to dev@ to inform the committers that the branch
      has been created and the feature freeze phase has started.

      This is an e-mail template you can use as a basis for
      announcing the new branch and feature freeze.

      .Mail template
      ----
      To: dev@lucene.apache.org
      Subject: New branch and feature freeze for Lucene/Solr {{ release_version }}

      NOTICE:

      Branch {{ release_branch }} has been cut and versions updated to {{ release_version_major }}.{{ release_version_minor + 1 }} on stable branch.

      Please observe the normal rules:

      * No new features may be committed to the branch.
      * Documentation patches, build patches and serious bug fixes may be
        committed to the branch. However, you should submit all patches you
        want to commit to Jira first to give others the chance to review
        and possibly vote against the patch. Keep in mind that it is our
        main intention to keep the branch as stable as possible.
      * All patches that are intended for the branch should first be committed
        to the unstable branch, merged into the stable branch, and then into
        the current release branch.
      * Normal unstable and stable branch development may continue as usual.
        However, if you plan to commit a big change to the unstable branch
        while the branch feature freeze is in effect, think twice: can't the
        addition wait a couple more days? Merges of bug fixes into the branch
        may become more difficult.
      * Only Jira issues with Fix version {{ release_version_major }}.{{ release_version_minor }} and priority "Blocker" will delay
        a release candidate build.

      Please observe the normal rules for committing to this branch:

      * Before committing to the branch, reply to this thread and argue
        why the fix needs backporting and how long it will take.
      * All issues accepted for backporting should be marked with {{ release_version }}
        in JIRA, and issues that should delay the release must be marked as Blocker
      * All patches that are intended for the branch should first be committed
        to the unstable branch, merged into the stable branch, and then into
        the current release branch.
      * Only Jira issues with Fix version {{ release_version }} and priority "Blocker" will delay

    description: |-
      These are typically edited on the Wiki

      Clone a page for a previous version as a starting point for your release notes.
      You will need two pages, one for Lucene and another for Solr, see links.
      Edit the contents of `CHANGES.txt` into a more concise format for public consumption.
      Ask on dev@ for input. Ideally the timing of this request mostly coincides with the
      release branch creation. It's a good idea to remind the devs of this later in the release too.

      NOTE: Do not add every single JIRA issue, but distill the Release note into important changes!

      Go to the JIRA "Manage Versions" Administration pages and add the new version:

      . Change name of version `master ({{ release_version_major }}.0)` into `{{ release_version_major }}.0`

      . Create a new (unreleased) version `{{ get_next_version }}`

      This needs to be done both for Lucene and Solr JIRAs, see links.

      Once you have transferred all maven artifacts to repository.apache.org,
      you will need to do some manual steps to actually release them to Maven Central:

      * Close the staging repository
      . Log in to https://repository.apache.org/ with your ASF credentials
      . Select "Staging Repositories" under "Build Promotion" from the navigation bar on the left
      . Select the staging repository containing the Lucene artifacts
      . Click on the "Close" button above the repository list, then enter a description when prompted, e.g. "Lucene/Solr {{ release_version }} RC{{ rc_number }}"
      * The system will now spend some time validating the artifacts. Grab a coke and come back.
      * Release the Lucene and/or Solr artifacts
      . Wait and keep clicking refresh until the "Release" button becomes available
      . Click on the "Release" button above the repository list, then enter a description when prompted, e.g. "Lucene/Solr {{ release_version }}".

      Maven central should show the release after a short while

    For every release, we publish docs on the website, we need to update the
    download pages etc. The Lucene website is hosted at https://github.com/apache/lucene-site
    and the Solr website is hosted at https://github.com/apache/solr-site,
    but the Javadocs and Solr Reference Guide are pushed to SVN and then included

      There are plugins for popular email programs, as well as browser plugins for webmail.
      See links for help on how to setup your email client for PGP.

      If you prefer to sign the announcements manually rather than using a plugin,
      you can do so from the command line and then copy the output into your mail program.

    title: Generate Backcompat Indexes for release branch
    description: |
      After each version of Lucene is released, compressed CFS, non-CFS, and sorted indexes created with 
      the newly released version are added to `lucene/backwards-codecs/src/test/org/apache/lucene/index/`, 
      for use in testing backward index compatibility via org.apache.lucene.index.TestBackwardsCompatibility, 
      which is also located under the `backwards-codecs/` module. There are also three indexes created only 
      with major Lucene versions: moreterms, empty, and dvupdates. These indexes are created via methods 
      on `TestBackwardsCompatibility` itself - see comments in the source for more information.

      There is a script (`dev-tools/scripts/addBackcompatIndexes.py`) that automates most of the process.
      It downloads the source for the specified release; generates indexes for the current release using 
      `TestBackwardsCompatibility`; compresses the indexes and places them in the correct place in the source 
      tree; modifies TestBackwardsCompatibility.java to include the generated indexes in the list of indexes 
      to test; and then runs `TestBackwardsCompatibility`.
      
      In this and the next two steps we'll guide you through using this tool on each of the branches.

      Shortly after new releases are first published, they are automatically copied to the archives.
      Only the latest point release from each active branch should be kept under the Lucene PMC 
      svnpubsub areas `dist/releases/lucene/` and `dist/releases/solr/`. Older releases can be 
      safely deleted, since they are already backed up in the archives.

      Currently these versions exist in the distribution directory:

      *{{ mirrored_versions|join(', ') }}*

      The commands below will remove old versions automatically. If this suggestion is wrong,
      please do *not* execute the commands automatically, but edit the command and run manually.
