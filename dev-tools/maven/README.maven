A. How to use nightly Jenkins-built Lucene/Solr Maven artifacts

   The most recently produced nightly Jenkins-built Lucene and Solr Maven
   artifacts are available in Maven repository layout here:
   
      <https://builds.apache.org/hudson/job/Lucene-Solr-Maven-trunk/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/maven_artifacts/>


B. How to generate Lucene Maven artifacts

   1. Prerequisites: JDK 1.5+, Ant 1.7.X, and maven-ant-tasks-2.1.1.jar

      In order to generate Maven artifacts for Lucene/Solr, you must first
      download the Maven ant tasks JAR (maven-ant-tasks-2.1.1.jar), e.g.
      from <http://maven.apache.org/ant-tasks/download.html>, and add it
      to any one of the following:

         a. Your $HOME/.ant/lib/ directory (C:\Users\username\.ant\lib\ under
            Windows Vista/7); or
         b. Your $ANT_HOME/lib/ directory (%ANT_HOME%\lib\ under Windows); or
         c. Your $CLASSPATH (%CLASSPATH% under Windows); or
         d. Your ant commond line: "-lib /path/to/maven-ant-tasks-2.1.1.jar".

   2. Run the following command from the lucene/ directory:

         ant generate-maven-artifacts
	  
      The above command will create an internal Maven repository under
      lucene/dist/maven/, including POMs, binary .jars, source .jars,
      and javadoc .jars, for Lucene Core, for the Lucene test framework,
      for each contrib, and for each module under the top-level modules/
      directory.


C. How to generate Solr Maven artifacts

   1. Prerequisites: JDK 1.6+; Ant 1.7.X; and maven-ant-tasks-2.1.1.jar 
      (see item A.1. above for where to put the Maven ant tasks jar).

   2. Run the following from the solr/ directory:

         ant generate-maven-artifacts
		 
      The above command will create an internal Maven repository under
      solr/package/maven/, including POMs, binary .jars, source .jars,
      and javadoc .jars, for Solr Core, for the Solr test framework,
      for each contrib, and for the Solr .war (for which there are no
      source or javadoc .jars).


D. How to use Maven to build Lucene/Solr

   In summary, to enable Maven builds, perform the following:

         svn update
         ant get-maven-poms
         mvn -N -Pbootstrap install

   The details, followed by some example Maven commands:

   1. Prerequisites: JDK 1.5+ (for Lucene); JDK 1.6+ (for Solr);
                     Maven 2.2.1 or 3.0.X

   2. Make sure your sources are up to date.  If you checked your sources out
      from the Apache Subversion repository, run "svn update" from the top
      level.

   3. Copy the Maven POM templates from under dev-tools/maven/ to where they
      they need to go in order to drive the Maven build, using the following
      command from the top-level directory:

         ant get-maven-poms

      Note that you will need to do this whenever changes to the POM
      templates are committed.  It's a good idea to follow every "svn update"
      with "ant get-maven-poms" for this reason.

      The above command copies all of the POM templates from dev-tools/maven/,
      filling in the project version with the default "X.X-SNAPSHOT".  If you
      want the POMs and the Maven-built artifacts to have a version other than
      the default, you can supply an alternate version on the command line
      with the above command, e.g.:

         ant -Dversion=4.0-my-special-version get-maven-poms

   4. Populate your local repository with .jars & POMs for dependencies that
      are not available from public Maven repositories (a.k.a. "non-mavenized
      dependencies"):

         mvn -N -Pbootstrap install

      Note that you will need to do this whenever changes to the non-Mavenized
      dependencies are committed.  It's a good idea to follow every
      "svn update" with "ant get-maven-poms" and "mvn -N -Pbootstrap install"
      for this reason.


   Some example Maven commands you can use after you perform the above
   preparatory steps:

   - Compile, package, and install all artifacts to your local repository:

         mvn install

     After compiling and packaging, but before installing each module's 
     artifact, the above command will also run all the module's tests.

     To compile, package and install all artifacts without running any tests:

         mvn -DskipTests install

   - Run tests:

         mvn test

     To run all test methods defined in a test class:

         mvn -Dtest=TestClassName test
