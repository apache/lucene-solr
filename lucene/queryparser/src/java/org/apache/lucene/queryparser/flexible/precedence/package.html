Precedence Query Parser Implementation

<h2>Lucene Precedence Query Parser</h2>

<p>
The Precedence Query Parser extends the Standard Query Parser and enables 
the boolean precedence. So, the query &lt;a AND b OR c AND d&gt; is parsed to 
&lt;(+a +b) (+c +d)&gt; instead of &lt;+a +b +c +d&gt;.
</p>
<p>
Check {@link org.apache.lucene.queryparser.flexible.standard.StandardQueryParser} for more details about the
supported syntax and query parser functionalities.
