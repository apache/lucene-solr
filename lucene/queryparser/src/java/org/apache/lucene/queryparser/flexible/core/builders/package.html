Necessary classes to implement query builders.

<h2>Query Parser Builders</h2>
<p>
The package <tt>org.apache.lucene.queryParser.builders</tt> contains the interface that
builders must implement, it also contain a utility {@link org.apache.lucene.queryparser.flexible.core.builders.QueryTreeBuilder}, which walks the tree
and call the Builder for each node in the tree.
Builder normally convert QueryNode Object into a Lucene Query Object,
and normally it's a one-to-one mapping class.

But other builders implementations can by written to convert QueryNode objects to other non lucene objects.
