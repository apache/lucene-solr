Standard Lucene Query Node Builders.

<h2>Standard Lucene Query Node Builders</h2>
<p>
The package org.apache.lucene.queryparser.flexible.standard.builders contains all the builders needed
to build a Lucene Query object from a query node tree. These builders expect the query node tree was
already processed by the {@link org.apache.lucene.queryparser.flexible.standard.processors.StandardQueryNodeProcessorPipeline}.
</p>
<p>
{@link org.apache.lucene.queryparser.flexible.standard.builders.StandardQueryTreeBuilder} is a builder that already contains a defined map that maps each QueryNode object
with its respective builder.
