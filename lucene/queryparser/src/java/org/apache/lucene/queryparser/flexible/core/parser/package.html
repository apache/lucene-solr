Necessary interfaces to implement text parsers.

<h2>Parser</h2>
<p>
The package <tt>org.apache.lucene.queryparser.flexible.parser</tt> contains interfaces
that should be implemented by the parsers.

Parsers produce QueryNode Trees from a string object.
These package still needs some work to add support to for multiple parsers.

Features that should be supported for the future, related with the parser:
- QueryNode tree should be able convertible to any parser syntax.
- The query syntax should support calling other parsers.
- QueryNode tree created by multiple parsers.
