IRAQI TROOPS REPORTED PUSHING BACK IRANIANS Iraq said today its troops were pushing Iranian forces out of 
  positions they had initially occupied when they launched a new offensive near the southern port of 
  Basra early yesterday.     A High Command communique said Iraqi troops had won a significant victory 
  and were continuing to advance.     Iraq said it had foiled a three-pronged thrust some 10 km 
  (six miles) from Basra, but admitted the Iranians had occupied ground held by the Mohammed al-Qassem 
  unit, one of three divisions attacked.     The communique said Iranian Revolutionary Guards were under 
  assault from warplanes, helicopter gunships, heavy artillery and tanks.     "Our forces are continuing 
  their advance until they purge the last foothold" occupied by the Iranians, it said.     
  (Iran said its troops had killed or wounded more than 4,000 Iraqis and were stabilising their new positions.)     
  The Baghdad communique said Iraqi planes also destroyed oil installations at Iran's southwestern Ahvaz field 
  during a raid today. It denied an Iranian report that an Iraqi jet was shot down.     
  Iraq also reported a naval battle at the northern tip of the Gulf. Iraqi naval units and forces defending an 
  offshore terminal sank six Iranian out of 28 Iranian boats attempting to attack an offshore terminal, 
  the communique said.      Reuter 3;
