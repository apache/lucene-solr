	This query was added to demonstrate nested boolean queries - there
	was a bug in the XML parser which added ALL child <Clause> tags to 
	the top level tags ie. took child and grandchild elements instead
	of just child elements. This was due to the use of the 
	Element.getElementsByTagName() call in BooleanQueryBuilder
