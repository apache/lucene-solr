    <!-- TermsFilter uses an analyzer to tokenize Field text and creates a filter for docs which 
      have ANY of the supplied terms. Unlike a RangeFilter this can be used for filtering on 
      multiple terms that are not necessarily in a sequence. An example might be a list of primary
      keys from a database query result or perhaps a choice of "category" labels picked by the end 
      user.
      As a filter, this is much faster than the equivalent query (a BooleanQuery with many 
      "should" TermQueries)
      
      This example might be just a list of Saturdays ie not a contiguous range of values
      which can be handled by rangefilter
