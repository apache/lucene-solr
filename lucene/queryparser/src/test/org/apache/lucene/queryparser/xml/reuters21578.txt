19870408	IRAQI TROOPS REPORTED PUSHING BACK IRANIANS Iraq said today its troops were pushing Iranian forces out of positions they had initially occupied when they launched a new offensive near the southern port of Basra early yesterday.     A High Command communique said Iraqi troops had won a significant victory and were continuing to advance.     Iraq said it had foiled a three-pronged thrust some 10 km (six miles) from Basra, but admitted the Iranians had occupied ground held by the Mohammed al-Qassem unit, one of three divisions attacked.     The communique said Iranian Revolutionary Guards were under assault from warplanes, helicopter gunships, heavy artillery and tanks.     "Our forces are continuing their advance until they purge the last foothold" occupied by the Iranians, it said.     (Iran said its troops had killed or wounded more than 4,000 Iraqis and were stabilising their new positions.)     The Baghdad communique said Iraqi planes also destroyed oil installations at Iran's southwestern Ahvaz field during a raid today. It denied an Iranian report that an Iraqi jet was shot down.     Iraq also reported a naval battle at the northern tip of the Gulf. Iraqi naval units and forces defending an offshore terminal sank six Iranian out of 28 Iranian boats attempting to attack an offshore terminal, the communique said.      Reuter 3;
19870408	SUMITOMO BANK AIMS AT QUICK RECOVERY FROM MERGER Sumitomo Bank Ltd <SUMI.T> is certain to lose its status as Japan's most profitable bank as a result of its merger with the Heiwa Sogo Bank, financial analysts said.     Osaka-based Sumitomo, with desposits of around 23.9 trillion yen, merged with Heiwa Sogo, a small, struggling bank with an estimated 1.29 billion dlrs in unrecoverable loans, in October.     But despite the link-up, Sumitomo President Koh Komatsu told Reuters he is confident his bank can quickly regain its position.     "We'll be back in position in first place within three years," Komatsu said in an interview.     He said that while the merger will initially reduce Sumitomo's profitability and efficiency, it will vastly expand Sumitomo's branch network in the Tokyo metropolitan area where it has been relatively weak.     But financial analysts are divided on whether and how quickly the gamble will pay off.     Some said Sumitomo may have paid too much for Heiwa Sogo in view of the smaller bank's large debts. Others argue the merger was more cost effective than creating a comparable branch network from scratch.     The analysts agreed the bank was aggressive. It has expanded overseas, entered the lucrative securities business and geared up for domestic competition, but they questioned the wisdom of some of those moves.     "They've made bold moves to put everything in place. Now it's largely out of their hands," said Kleinwort Benson Ltd financial analyst Simon Smithson.     Among Sumitomo's problems are limits placed on its move to enter U.S. Securities business by taking a share in American investment bank Goldman, Sachs and Co.     Sumitomo last August agreed to pay 500 mln dlrs for a 12.5 pct limited partnership in the bank, but for the time being at least, the Federal Reserve Board has forbidden them to exchange personnel, or increase the business they do with each other.     "The tie-up is widely looked on as a lame duck because the Fed was stricter than Sumitomo expected," said one analyst.     But Komatsu said the move will pay off in time.     "U.S. Regulations will change in the near future and if so, we can do various things. We only have to wait two or three years, not until the 21st century," Komatsu said.     Komatsu is also willing to be patient about possible routes into the securities business at home.     Article 65 of the Securities and Exchange Act, Japan's version of the U.S. Glass-Steagall Act, separates commercial from investment banking.     But the walls between the two are crumbling and Komatsu said he hopes further deregulation will create new opportunities.     "We need to find new business chances," Komatsu said. "In some cases these will be securities related, in some cases trust bank related. That's the kind of deregulation we want."     Until such changes occur, Sumitomo will focus on such domestic securities business as profitable government bond dealing and strengthening relations with Meiko Securities Co Ltd, in which it holds a five pct share, Komatsu said.     He said Sumitomo is cautiously optimistic about entering the securities business here through its Swiss universal bank subsidiary, Banca del Gottardo.      The Finance Ministry is expected to grant licences to securities subsidiaries of U.S. Commercial banks soon, following a similar decision for subsidiaries of European universal banks in which the parent holds a less than 50 pct.     But Komatsu is reluctant to push hard for a similar decision on a Gottardo subsidiary.     "We don't want to make waves. We expect this will be allowed in two or three years," he said.     Like other city banks, Sumitomo is also pushing to expand lending to individuals and small and medium businesses to replace disappearing demand from big business, he added.     The analysts said Sumitomo will have to devote a lot of time to digesting its most recent initiatives, including the merger with ailing Heiwa Sogo.     "It's (Sumitomo) been bold in its strategies," said Kleinwort's Smithson.     "After that, it's a question of absorbing and juggling around. It will be the next decade before we see if the strategy is right or wrong."  REUTER 3;
19870408	U.K. MONEY MARKET DEFICIT FORECAST AT 250 MLN STG The Bank of England said it forecast a shortage of around 250 mln stg in the money market today.     Among the main factors affecting liquidity, bills maturing in official hands and the take-up of treasury bills will drain some 505 mln stg, while bills for repurchase by the market will remove around 194 mln. In addition, a rise in note circulation and bankers' balances below target will each drain around 110 mln stg.     Partly offsetting these outflows, exchequer transactions will add some 690 mln stg to the system today.  REUTER 3;

19870409	AEGON EXPECTS MODERATE RISE IN 1987 PROFITS Dutch insurer AEGON NV <AEGN.AS> reported a 6.4 pct increase in 1986 net profits to 327.1 mln guilders and said it expected a moderate increase in profits for 1987.     Total revenue was eight pct lower in 1986 at 7.97 billion guilders vs 8.7 billion guilders in 1985. The company said its revenues were down due to lower foreign exchange rates and a change in accounting practice. It added that revenues would have risen by about seven pct had those changes not occurred.     Revenue from Dutch operations rose five pct in 1986, mainly due to its life insurance business.     Health insurance revenues in the Netherlands also rose despite a notable shift to insurances with lower premiums and higher personal risks.     Damage insurances made losses, mainly due to car damage insurances. AEGON did not specify the loss.     In the United States, revenue in guilders from health and life insurance was lower. AEGON said this was due to a change in accounting for U.S. Annuities.     AEGON said annuities are subject to such strong personal investment influences that it should be accounted differently from the more traditional insurances.     This change in accounting practice and another change to account for profits made on fixed interest investments, resulted in an incidental rise in net profits of 31 mln guilders.     AEGON said incidental negative influences on net profits were slightly higher, being the lower dollar rate, high initial costs for new products, and the cost of new headquarters in The Hague.     In 1986, a large number of new insurance products emerged in the Netherlands and the U.S., AEGON said. Large initial costs for these products have depressed net profits somewhat.     Monumental Corp, a U.S. Insurer which merged with AEGON in May 1986, saw its profits almost completely eroded by these costs and made only a small contribution to the group's profits.     AEGON said it has written-off 657 mln guilders in goodwill for Monumental Corp.     AEGON's net equity was 2.71 billion guilders in December 1986, against 3.46 billion the year before.   REUTER 3;

19870409	ANALYSTS DOUBT FED FIRMED DESPITE BORROWING RISE Economists said that they doubt the Federal Reserve is firming policy to aid the dollar, despite higher discount window borrowings in the latest two-week statement period and very heavy borrowings Wednesday.     Data out today show net borrowings from the Fed averaged 393 mln dlrs in the two weeks to Wednesday, up from 265 mln dlrs in the prior statement period. Wednesday borrowings were 1.4 billion dlrs as Federal funds averaged a high 6.45 pct.     "One could make a case that the Fed is firming, but it probably isn't," said William Sullivan of Dean Witter Reynolds.     Sullivan said some may assume the Fed has firmed policy modestly to support the dollar because net borrowings in the two-weeks to Wednesday were nearly 400 mln dlrs after averaging around 250 mln dlrs over the previous two months.     However, the Dean Witter economist noted that the latest two-week period included a quarter end when seasonal demand often pushes up borrrowings.     "Some might argue that the Fed was firming policy, but it looks like it tried to play catchup with reserve provisions late in the statement period and didn't quite make it," said Ward McCarthy of Merrill Lynch Capital Markets.     A Fed spokesman told a press press conference today that the Fed had no large net one-day miss of two billion dlrs or more in its reserve projections in the week ended Wednesday.     Still, McCarthy said it may have had a cumulative miss in its estimates over the week that caused it to add fewer reserves earlier in the week than were actually needed.     The Fed took no market reserve management action last Thursday and Friday, the first two days of the week. It added temporary reserves indirectly on Monday via two billion dlrs of customer repurchase agreements and then supplied reserves directly via System repurchases on Tuesday and Wednesday.     Based on Fed data out today, economists calculated that the two-day System repurchase agreements the Fed arrranged on Tuesday totaled around 5.9 billion dlrs. They put Wednesday's overnight System repos at approximately 3.4 billion dlrs.     "It is quite clear that the Fed is not firming policy at this time," said Larry Leuzzi of S.G. Warburg and Co Inc.     Citing the view shared by the other two economists, Leuzzi said the Fed cannot really afford to seriously lift interest rates to help the dollar because that would harm already weak economies in the United States and abroad and add to the financial stress of developing countries and their lenders.     "Those who believe the Fed tightened policy in the latest statement period have to explain why it acted before the dollar tumbled," said McCarthy of Merrill Lynch.     He said the dollar staged a precipitous drop as a new statement period began today on disappointment yesterday's Washington meetings of international monetary officials failed to produce anything that would offer substantive dollar aid.     In fact, currency dealers said there was nothing in Wednesday's G-7 communique to alter the prevailing view that the yen needs to rise further to redress the huge trade imbalance between the United States and Japan.     The economists generally agreed that the Fed is aiming for steady policy now that should correspond to a weekly average Fed funds rate between six and 6-1/8 pct. This is about where the rate has been since early November.     "I'm not so sure that the Fed is engineering a tighter policy to help the dollar, as some suspect," said Sullivan of Dean Witter.     If it is, however, he said that Fed probably has just nudged up its funds rate goal to around 6.25 to 6.35 pct from six to 6.10 pct previously.  Reuter 3;

19870409	AUSTRALIAN UNIONS AND NSW GOVERNMENT REACH DEAL Union and New South Wales government officials have reached a compromise in a dispute over workers compensation, averting increased industrial action in the state, union sources said.     But some unions, including those of building and mining workers, said they were dissatisfied with the deal and would continue their strikes for a few more days.     State officials said the government had agreed to revise its proposals to cut compensation and would allow slightly higher cash benefits for injured workers.     Under the original proposal, which sparked strikes and other industrial action in the state on April 7, workers' compensation would have been cut by one third. Full details of the compromise package are not yet known.     The Labour Council, affiliated to the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU), had threatened to paralyse New South Wales unless the government modified its pending legislation on the issue.

19870409	BELGIAN CURRENT ACCOUNT SURPLUS WIDENS IN 1986 Belgium's current account surplus, measured on a cash basis, widened sharply to 134.9 billion francs last year from 17.5 billion in 1985, the Finance Ministry said.     The increase was due almost entirely to a sharp rise in the goods trade surplus to 126.1 billion francs from 20.4 billion.     The services trade surpluses increased to 52.4 billion francs from 38.9 billion while the deficit on transfers rose slightly to 43.6 billion from 41.8 billion.     Private sector capital operations showed a steeply higher deficit of 160.7 billion francs after 56.9 billion in 1985.  Reuter 3;

19870409	BRAZIL COCOA EXPORTERS UNLIKELY TO LIMIT SALES Brazilian cocoa exporters are not likely to follow the example of Cocoa Producers Alliance, CPA, members, who may limit sales of the product in an effort to boost world prices, trade sources said.     They said a similar procedure was taken in the past in Brazil and that it did not work out according to plans.     "The cocoa market is completely free. Unlike coffee, which is controlled through export registrations, cocoa exporters in Brazil operate at their own free will," a trade source said.     The traders were responding to questions whether they would follow the example of CPA members meeting in Yaounde.     The sources said the Banco do Brasil's Foreign Trade Department, CACEX, never interferes in the cocoa market by rejecting sales that do not meet certain price or shipment criteria.     "The position of local producers is always to negotiate as they please. If they buy for ten and sell for eleven and think it's a good deal, they are free to go ahead," one source added.  Reuter 3;
19870409	BRAZIL COTTON CROP LOWER -- USDA REPORT Brazil's 1986/87 cotton crop estimate has been reduced to 710,000 from 735,000 tonnes (lint basis), the U.S. Agriculture Department's officer in Sao Paulo said in a field report.     The report, dated April 7, said the reduction is based on an expected smaller harvest in the center-south region.     The center-south crop is now estimated at 550,000 tonnes -- 25,000 tonnes below the previous estimate.     Hot, dry weather during part of January and excessive rains in some areas in February reduced yield prospects and may have affected quality, the report said.     Nearly 60 pct of the crop has been harvested in Parana and slightly less in Sao Paulo, it said. Cotton entering gins is of fairly good quality, according to trade sources, it said.  Reuter 3;
19870409	BRAZIL SOYBEAN YIELDS SEEN AVERAGE - USDA REPORT Based on field travel in the Brazilian state of Parana, soybean yields should be about average or 2.0 to 2.2 tonnes per hectare, the U.S. Agriculture Department's officer in Sao Paulo said in a field report.     The report, dated March 24, noted Parana accounts for about 20 to 24 pct of Brazil's total soybean crop.     It said generally favorable weather from early December through February helped compensate for earlier dryness.     However, hot, dry weather during the past 20 to 30 days followed by an unseasonably brief cold spell during the second week of march has raised concern about late planted soybeans which are still immature, but the impact may be localized, the report said.     The corn crop is expected to be a record and will create serious storage problems, the report said.     Due to favorable support prices, corn area increased by more than 25 pct at the expense of soybeans, and yields are expected to be above average, it said.     Due to late plantings only about 20 pct of the corn crop crop has been harvested.     During the field trip long truck lines were noted at grain elevators where preference is given to soybeans over corn, the report said.     New crop wheat plantings are expected to decline  -- Parana accounts for about 60 pct of total production. Major reasons for the decline are expected reduced government support price and good summer crop harvests.  Reuter 3;

19870409	BUNDESBANK SEES NO CHANGE IN MONETARY COURSE The Bundesbank sees no current reason to change monetary course, vice-president Helmut Schlesinger told Reuters in a telephone interview.     Schlesinger was responding to questions following remarks yesterday by Bundesbank board member Claus Koehler and West Berlin state central bank president Dieter Hiss, which, dealers said, revived some speculation that German interest rate cuts may once again be under discussion.     Schlesinger said he had no comment on the remarks of his two central bank council colleagues.     But he added that the last central bank council meeting on April 2 had discussed the economic situation with a mood of "subdued optimism," particularly influenced by the news brought by several state central bank presidents.     "Much is going better than the impression gained by the public from the January figures, which have been in the meantime superseded," he said.     German January industrial output fell 3.0 pct after a decline of 0.9 pct in December. New industry orders fell 1.9 pct after they had been unchanged in December.     Bank economists said that the two together showed the economy would either stagnate or contract in the first quarter of 1987.     Aside from the economic developments, Schlesinger added, a steady monetary course was important to hold the dollar/mark rate around current levels as Bundesbank president Karl Otto Poehl had said while attending the Washington World Bank/IMF meeting.     Asked, however, if the Bundesbank could move to cut rates on repurchase agreements at the setting of the next repurchase tender, due next Tuesday, Schlesinger said, "Since the central bank council gives its opinion on this theme only every 14 days, this is hardly probable."     Responding to the question whether the Bundesbank had moved away from a policy of targetting monetary growth toward one of targetting currency rates, Schlesinger said he could have no comment on the subject while negotiations were still in progress in Washington.

19870409	CANADA TRADE RISE SEEN AS START OF RECOVERY Canada's trade picture has brightened considerably, underscoring economists' predictions the sector would post a long awaited recovery this year.     The federal government reported today that the monthly surplus soared to 1.25 billion Canadian dlrs in February, double January's 623 mln dlrs surplus and sharply higher than February 1986's 189 mln dlr tally.     "Hopefully it's the beginning of a trend," said Richardson Greenshields of Canada Ltd economist Susan Clark in Toronto.     Economists generally don't expect such large gains over the next months, but are looking for an upward trend throughout the year.     "We thought the trade balance would improve ... over the year, and it certainly looks as if this morning's figure is indicative of that," commented economist James Donegan at the Toronto securities firm of Midland Doherty Ltd.     Statistics Canada reported the surplus was driven by a 23 pct gain in automobile product exports to a record 3.2 billion dls in the month.     "Recovery in the automotive sector helped push the value of exports up by 5.9 pct in February," the agency said in its monthly report.     Total exports expanded to 10.44 billion dlrs from 9.85 billion dlrs in February, while imports slipped to 9.19 billion dlrs from 9.23 billion dlrs.     Economists have predicted the 1987 trade surplus would end up three to five billion dlrs higher than last year's dismal 10.1 billion dlr total. In 1985 the surplus was 17.48 billion dlrs.     Money market analysts said the positive trade news touched off a modest rally in the Canadian dollar, which rose to 76.85 U.S. cts on North American markets early this morning after closing at 76.58 cts Wednesday.     The currency was hovering around 76.78 cts in early afternoon trading.     Economists have been banking on an improved trade performance this year to stimulate an otherwise sluggish Canadian economy.     Money market analysts said the positive trade news touched off a modest rally in the Canadian dollar, which rose to 76.85 U.S. cts on North American markets early this morning after closing at 76.58 cts Wednesday.     The currency was hovering around 76.78 cts in early afternoon trading.     Economists have been banking on an improved trade performance this year to stimulate an otherwise sluggish Canadian economy.     They say the country's consumers, who have been spending at a torrid pace in recent years, will sharply curtail outlays this year and this should help curtail the flow of imports into the country.     Meanwhile, demand for Canadian exports in the United States, by far the country's largest market, is expected to be strong as a result of a projected rise in American consumer spending and the relatively low value of the Canadian currency.     "We maintain what's going to drive Canada's export performance is income growth in the U.S.," said Midland's Donegan.     But at the Bank of Nova Scotia, deputy chief economist Warren Jestin was less optimistic about the U.S. outlook and said it could be a mistake to read too much into February's trade upturn.     Jestin said, "Given the fact the U.S. economy is showing signs of weakening--particularly car sales--it would indicate that part of the strength (in Canada's trade figures) is probably transitory."

Official sources said the bank, France's sixth largest in terms of its deposits and seventh in terms of its assets,  planned a share split to increase the number of shares on offer ahead of the sale of 40 pct of its ordinary share capital to the public, of 10 pct to staff and 20 pct abroad.     Previously one of France's biggest private banks, it was nationalised by the Socialists in 1982.     The sources said it was too early to give details of the planned split or of the share price, but cited April 27 as a likely date for the flotation launch.     So far 30 pct of the group's capital, currently at 10.33 mln shares of 100 francs nominal, has been offered for sale to large private investors to constitute a solid core of eight to ten shareholders before the flotation.

19870409	CLEVITE <CLEV> AMENDS RIGHTS PLAN Clevite Industries Inc, which earlier received a 96 mln dlr takeover offer from J.P. Industries Inc <JPI>, said it amended its Shareholder Rights Plan so that certain provisions of the plan cannot occur until the board determines that it is in the best interests of the company and stockholders.     The plan, adopted in December 1986, permits Clevite to issue shares at half price to existing stockholders and allows stockholders to buy shares of an unfriendly bidder at half price.     Clevite said the amendments by its board effectively mean that the so-called flip-in and flip-over provisions of its rights plan can only be triggered by affirmative board approval.     The company said it acted inview of the proposed acquisition and because certain debt restrictions could block its ability to redeem the rights.  Reuter 3;

19870409	CRUDE OIL NETBACKS UP SHARPLY IN EUROPE, U.S. Crude oil netback values in complex refineries rose sharply in Europe and firmed in the U.S. last Friday from the previous week but fell sharply in Singapore, according to calculations by Reuters Pipeline.     The firmer tone to refining margins in Europe and the U.S. relected higher prices for petroleum products, particularly gasoline, and support from crude oil prices.     Netback values for crude oil refined in Northern Europe rose substantially following strong gains in gasoline prices there. Brent is valued at 19.45 dlrs, up 56 cts a barrel or three pct from the previous week.     In the U.S. Gulf, sweet crudes rose in value by 14 cts to 19.33 dlrs for West Texas Intermediate, up about 0.7 pct.     Sour grades in the U.S. Gulf showed an increase of 33 cts a barrel for Alaska North Slope, up 1.7 pct.     But netbacks for crude oil refined in Singapore fell sharply, down 15 cts to as much as 68 cts a barrel as ample distillate supplies weighed on petroleum product prices.     Attaka in Singapore is valued at 18.55 dlrs, a decline of 68 cts a barrel or 3.5 pct from the previous week.     For refineries in the Mediterranean, netback values were mostly lower, with declines of seven to 14 cts. The value of Kuwait crude fell 14 cts to 18.37 dlrs, while Iranian Light fell 11 cts to 19.14 dlrs.

19870409	DISEASE PUTS ZIMBABWE BEEF EXPORTS IN JEOPARDY Zimbabwe's beef exports to the European Community (EC), potentially worth 70 mln Zimbabwean dlrs this year, may be jeopardised by an outbreak of foot and mouth disease in southwestern Matabeleland, industry sources said.     The country has temporarily suspended beef exports to the EC because of the outbreak and awaits a decision from the EC veterinary committee, which is considering a formal ban.     The outbreak in the country's main ranching province has already led neighbouring beef-producing Botswana and Zambia to bar beef and dairy imports from Zimbabwe, threatening the dairy industry with a loss of at least one mln dlrs in export revenue.     "The situation is still uncertain at the moment. Normally when an outbreak occurs there is an automatic suspension of beef exports," one industry source said yesterday.      Commenting on EC policy, he explained, "Depending on the seriousness of the outbreak the (veterinary) committee then decides on three options, allowing us to continue exporting beef from disease-free areas, clamping a three-month suspension on exports or banning us from exporting for a year. We are still awaiting their decision," he added, asking not to be identified.     Zimbabwe was granted an export quota of 8,100 tonnes of high-grade beef to EC markets in 1985 after the country had spent millions of dollars erecting disease-control fences and upgrading abattoirs to meet stringent EC rules.     Should the EC ban Zimbabwean exports, the country will be forced to sell its beef on glutted world beef markets at low prices, the source said. Projected earnings from beef sales could fall about 23 mln dlrs as a result, he said.  Reuter 3;
19870409	DISNEY FAMILY MAKES BID FOR HOLLY SUGAR <HLY> The Roy Disney family disclosed in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that it made a bid to acquire Holly Sugar Corp for a package of cash and securities.     Shamrock Holdings of California Inc, a Disney family company, said it submitted the bid on April 8 to Salomon Brothers Inc, Holly Sugar's investment banker.     The offer was for 45 dlrs in cash, securities with a face value of 70 dlrs, and a "contingent payment certificate" that would pay out as much as 70 dlrs over a 20-year period for each share of Holly Sugar outstanding.

19870409	DOLLAR ENDS LOWER IN LACKLUSTRE FRANKFURT The dollar drifted down to end one pfennig lower after a lacklustre session, held in limits by the lack of concrete news from the Group of Seven meeting and comments on the edge of the Washington IMF/World Bank meeting.     Dealers said the communique early in the European morning from the G-7 meeting contained no significant new factors and although the dollar dipped it generally resisted further attempts to push it lower through the day.     The U.S. Currency ended at 1.8270/80 marks, below yesterday's last 1.8365/75.     Koch said the assessment of the dollar's direction was based on a global view, with operators paying most attention to comments by finance officials to see how closely they stated adherence to international agreements such as those set at the Plaza Hotel in 1985 and in Paris on February 22.     Koch described the wording of the communique from the G-7 as "soft as wax."     Bundebank vice-president Helmut Schlesinger told Reuters in a telephone interview that the German central bank sees no current reason to change monetary course at present.     Schlesinger was responding to questions following remarks yesterday by Bundesbank board member Claus Koehler and West Berlin state central bank president Dieter Hiss, which dealers said revived some speculation that German interest rate cuts may be under consideration.     German call money was slightly softer today, at around 3.70 pct after 3.80 yesterday.     Some dealers said rates on new liquidity injections added via Bundesbank securities repurchase agreements may be cut next week. Hopes of a cut were dashed on Tuesday with an allocation at an unchanged 3.80 pct.     But speaking of the pact tender rate next week, Schlesinger said, "since the central bank council gives its opinion on this theme only every 14 days, this is hardly probable."     Euromark rates scarcely responded to the central bankers comments, with six months funds ending unaltered at around 3-7/8 pct. Eurodollars for the same maturity rose a fractional 1/16 pct from yesterday to around 6-11/16 pct.     Sterling dipped to end at 2.952/956 marks after 2.960/965 last night. The Swiss franc firmed slightly to 120.30/45 marks per 100 from 120.25/40, with the yen soaring however to 1.2570/90 marks per 100 from 1.2515/35 yesterday.     EMS currencies saw the French franc end unchanged from last night at 30.03/06 marks per 100, with the Belgian franc easing however to 4.829/831 marks per 100 from 4.831/833.  REUTER 3;

The central bank bought dollars through Tokyo brokers just before and after the market opening, the dealers said.     The intervention took place when the dollar fell to 143.20 yen, one dealer said.     The dollar opened at 1.8155/60 marks against 1.8187/97 in New York.     The dollar fell as low as 142.90 yen despite central bank intervention at 143.00 yen, dealers said.     Selling pressure was strong from securities houses and institutional investors in hectic and nervous trading on underlying bearish sentiment for the dollar, they said.     Most dealers were surpised by the dollar's sharp fall against the yen in New York, although many had expected such a drop to happen eventually.     Institutional investors are expected to sell the dollar aggressively if it rises to around 143.50 yen, dealers said.     The U.S. Currency steadied well above 143.00 yen after Bank of Japan intervention and scattered short-covering, they said.

Hutton LBO Inc said the tender offer by its wholly owned unit, PC Acquisition Inc, for Purolator Courier Corp <PCC> expired at 2400 EDT yesterday without the purchase of any Purolator common stock.     Hutton added that PC Acquisition also terminated its merger agreement with Purolator.     Hutton said the offer, which had been conditioned upon the tender of at least 5,116,892 Purolator shares, or about two-thirds of the outstanding shares, was terminated because the minimum number of shares was not tendered.     Purolator had entered into a definitive agreement with PC Acquisition, part-owned by E.F. Hutton LBO Inc, a unit of E.F.

19870409	EC COMMISSION AUTHORISED TO BUY MAIZE IN JUNE The European Commission was authorised to buy up to one mln tonnes of maize into intervention stores in the second half of June, although sales into intervention normally end on April 30, Commission sources said.     They said approval was given by the EC's Cereals Management Committee because of the possible disturbance of the market due to heavy imports of maize under the agreement between the EC and the United States.

19870409	EC LAUNCHES ANTI-DUMPING PROBE ON JAPANESE CHIPS The European Community launched an investigation into allegations of dumping by Japanese semiconductor makers in a move which diplomats said could mark an intensification of world trade strains.     Tokyo already faces a deadline of April 17 from Washington for the imposition of 300 mln dlrs worth of tariffs on chips it imports into the U.S.     The EC Executive Commission said today the European Electrical Component Manufacturers Association complained that Japanese firms were selling high capacity EPROM type (erasable programmable read only memory) chips at unfairly low prices.     Japan last year took 78 pct of the 170 mln dlr EC EPROM market, up from 60 pct in 1984. The EC firms said they had been forced to offer their products at a discount of up to 30 pct in order to compete with the Japanese.     The Commission said it believed the Association had given sufficient elements of proof for dumping to warrant an investigation, which could lead it to impose duties if it found the complaints were justified.     The Commission claims last year's accord between the U.S. And Japan on microchip pricing gives U.S. Firms privileged access to the Japanese market.  REUTER 3;
19870409	EC SUGAR TENDER SEEN MARKING NO CHANGE IN POLICY The maximum export rebate granted at yesterday's EC sugar tender marked no change in policy over producer complaints that they are not obtaining the EC intervention price in exporting sugar outside the Community, EC Commission sources said.     The maximum rebate was 46.496 Ecus per 100 kilos for 118,350 tonnes of sugar, down from 46.864 Ecus the previous week, but the change is explained by world market conditions.     Producers claim the rebate was short of the level needed to obtain a price equivalent to the intervention price by over one Ecu per 100 kilos, and was 0.87 Ecu short the previous week, the sources said.     They said this was despite the fact that the Commission had to accept 785,000 tonnes of sugar into intervention from operators protesting that rebates are too low.     Operators have now until early May to withdraw this sugar. But they have not given any sign of planned withdrawals unless the Commission reviews its export policy, they said.  REUTER 3;
19870409	ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - TELECOM IS KEY JAPAN MINISTRY Japan's little-known Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications (MPT) has emerged as an international force to be reckoned with, political analysts said.     MPT, thrust into the spotlight by trade rows with the U.S. And Britain, is in a position of strength due to its control of a lucrative industry and its ties with important politicians, they said.     "The ministry is standing athwart the regulatory control of a key industrial sector, telecommunications and information," said one diplomatic source.     "They are a potent political force," the diplomatic source said.     But MPT is finding domestic political prowess does not always help when it comes to trade friction diplomacy, analysts said.     "The ministry was a minor ministry and its people were not so internationalized," said Waseda University professor Mitsuru Uchida. "Suddenly they're standing at the centre of the world community and in that sense, they're at a loss (as to) how to face the situation."     Most recently the ministry has been embroiled in a row with London over efforts by Britain's Cable and Wireless Plc to keep a major stake in one of two consortia trying to compete in Japan's lucrative overseas telephone business.     The ministry has favoured the merger of the two rival groups, arguing the market cannot support more than one competitor to Kokusai Denshin Denwa Co Ltd, which now monopolizes the business.     It has also opposed a major management role in the planned merger for any non-Japanese overseas telecommunications firm on the grounds that no such international precedent exists.     The ministry's stance has outraged both London, which has threatened to retaliate, and Washington, which says the merger plan is evidence of Japan's failure to honour pledges to open its telecommunications market.     Washington is also angry over other ministry moves which it says have limited access for U.S. Firms to Japan's car telephone and satellite communications market.     Much of MPT's new prominence stems from the growth of the sector it regulates.     "What has been happening is an important shift in the economy which makes the ministry a very important place," said James Abegglen, head of the consulting firm Asia Advisory Service Inc.     A decision to open the telecommunications industry to competition under a new set of laws passed in 1985 has boosted rather than lessened MPT's authority, analysts said.     "With the legal framework eased, they became the de facto legal framework," said Bache Securities (Japan) analyst Darrell Whitten.     Close links with the powerful political faction of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) nurtured by former Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka are another key to MPT's influence, the analysts said.     "Other factions ignored MPT (in the 1970s), but the Tanaka faction was forward looking and ... Recognized the importance of MPT," Uchida said. Many former bureaucrats became members of the influential political group, he added.     The ministry also has power in the financial sector due to the more than 100,000 billion yen worth of deposits in the Postal Savings System, analysts said.     MPT has helped block Finance Ministry plans to deregulate interest rates on small deposits, a key element in financial liberalisation, since the change would remove the Postal Savings System's ability to offer slightly higher rates than banks, they said.     Diplomatic sources, frustrated with what they see as MPT's obstructionist and protectionist posture, have characterized the ministry as feudal.     Critics charge MPT with protecting its own turf, limiting competition and sheltering the former monopolies under its wing. Providing consumers with the best service at the lowest price takes a back seat to such considerations, they said.     But many of the ministry's actions are not unlike those of its bureaucratic counterparts in much of the Western world including Britain, several analysts said.     "The United States is really the odd man out," Abegglen said.

Oil output was halted on March 5 by an earthquake which damaged 50 km of the main pipeline linking jungle oilfields at Lago Agrio to the Ecuadorean port of Balao on the Pacific.     About 13 km of the new link, capable of carrying some 50,000 barrels per day (bpd), has been built, he said.     Ecuador pumped 245,000 to 250,000 bpd before the earthquake.     The new link will connect Lago Agrio to Puerto Colon in Colombia, the starting point of Columbia's pipeline to the Pacific ocean port of Temuco.     The government estimates it will take about four more months to repair the Lago Agrio to Balao pipeline and return output to normal levels, the spokesman said.  REUTER 3;

An Egyptian trade official in Paris confirmed cancellation of the tender following the Islamic Corp offer, which he said the government had refused for legal reasons.

19870409	EUROPEAN MARKETS REACT QUIETLY TO G-7 COMMUNIQUE European currency markets reacted quietly to the G-7 communique, with comments from bankers and dealers ranging from disappointment that it was not more concrete to surprise that the markets should have expected so much.     The dollar opened lower against virtually all currencies and traded in a narrow range after the communique, which reaffirmed support for the Paris accord on currency stabilisation but contained no moves to strengthen it.     Dealers in Frankfurt and Zurich saw the dollar remaining broadly entrenched in its current trading range.     "The dollar is likely to stay within a range of 1.80 to 1.84 marks," said Gisela Steinhaeuser, senior dealer at Chase Bank AG. She said there was some resistance to further climbs.     However, she said the dollar could break out of the range with major surprises such as a worse-than-expected U.S. Merchandise trade deficit, due next Tuesday.     Theodor Stadelmann, dealer with Bank Julius Baer and Co Ltd in Zurich, said he expects the dollar to hold steady against the mark and Swiss franc but to weaken further against the yen, possibly to 140 yen.     A Milan banker shared Stadelmann's view, saying he expects a dollar-yen range of 140-150 in the short term.     London traders said the G-7 communique failed to curb underlying bearishness toward the dollar but this negative sentiment was not yet strong enough to tempt interbank operators to test the downside.     Concern that finance ministers and officials still in Washington could issue more concrete statements in favour of currency stabilisation kept players sidelined, along with worries about provoking fresh central bank intervention in the near term, the traders said.     Most Paris dealers expressed disappointment at the communique, saying nothing has changed to reverse the dollar's downward trend.     Traders in several centres said the market would look for fresh opportunities to test the willingness of central banks to defend current ranges, which the communique said were "broadly consistent with economic fundamentals and the basic policy intentions outlined at the Louvre meeting."     Dave Jouhin, senior dealer at Midland Bank in London, said "They're going to put somebody's resolve to the test soon." The U.S. February trade data may provide the trigger, dealers said.     However, some dealers said London-based operators would be unlikely to open major positions next week ahead of the long Easter weekend. They saw near-term technical support at 1.825 marks and 145 yen and resistance about 1.83 marks and 146 yen.     Chase Bank's Steinhaeuser and other Frankfurt dealers said the G-7 communique guaranteed a relatively calm and stable market for the foreseeable future compared with the extreme volatility seen in the first few months of this year.     One dealer at a German bank said the wording of the communique made clear the leading nations did not want a further dollar drop, and this was supporting the dollar.     The German dealer saw the dollar gradually appreciating to 1.87 marks, broadly seen as its upper limit within the Louvre accord's supposed currency target range.     A Swiss bank economist said he believed the markets were ready for a period of "mainly sideways movement."     But Milan dealers were sceptical about the communique contributing to greater stability.     "Nothing has changed substantially to give the dollar a big boost," said one dealer, while another Italian banker said he expects the dollar to trade between 1.77 and 1.87 German marks in the next three months.     A Swiss monetary source, who asked not to be named, said the communique had been in line with realistic expectations and should not have produced disappointment.     "The problem is that the changes needed in fiscal and trade policies to redress current imbalances are of a different timescale than currency markets operate on," the source told Reuters, "This is a political process which takes time."     Alois Schwietert, chief economist at Swiss Bank Corp in Basle, also questioned the tone of disappointment evident on currency markets today. "Did people really expect a patent remedy?" he asked.     Bank economists in Paris noted yesterday's meeting was only the first in a series and said the market would watch carefully in the next few weeks for any changes in positions.     A senior economist with Banque Indosuez said the focus was now on trade and growth rather than interest rates. Any move by Japan and West Germany to boost their economic growth could lead to a quick change in the U.S. Position.     Dealers in all centres agreed that markets would be wary in pushing the dollar too far too quickly in the coming months while central banks appear resolved to use their muscle to support the Paris accord.

19870409	FAO SEES LOWER GLOBAL WHEAT, GRAIN OUTPUT IN 1987 The U.N. Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) said global wheat and coarse grain output was likely to fall in 1987 but supplies would remain adequate to meet demand.     FAO said in its monthly food outlook bulletin total world grain output was expected to fall 38 mln tonnes to 1,353 mln in 1987, due mainly to unusually high winter losses in the Soviet Union, drought in China and reduced plantings in North America.     World cereal stocks at the end of 1986/87 were forecast to rise 47 mln tonnes to a record 452 mln tonnes, softening the impact of reduced production. But stocks are unevenly distributed, with about 50 pct held by the U.S.     "Thus the food security prospects in 1987/88 for many developing countries, particularly in Africa, depend crucially on the outcome of this year's harvests," FAO said.     FAO said world cereal supplies in 1986/87 were estimated at a record 2,113 mln tonnes, about five pct higher than last season and due mainly to large stocks and a record 1986 harvest, estimated at 1,865 mln tonnes.     FAO's forecast of 1986/87 world cereals trade was revised upwards by eight mln tonnes to 179 mln due to the likelihood of substantial buying by China and the Soviet Union.  REUTER 3;

19870409	FINANCE MINISTERS AGREE ON NEED FOR STABILITY Finance ministers from seven major industrialized nations agreed on the need to stabilize currencies at current levels but said more action was needed to reduce trade imbalances and sustain economic growth.     In a communique issued after a four-hour meeting at the U.S. Treasury that ended last night, the ministers said the value of the dollar and other currencies was basically correct now, and they welcomed new measures planned by the Japanese to boost their economy.     West German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg called it a "good meeting" and in brief remarks exchanged with reporters other ministers seemed pleased with its outcome.     Shortly after the communique was issued and just as foreign exchange trading opened in Tokyo, the Bank of Japan intervened again to prevent the yen rising too quickly.     The communique said, "The ministers and governors reaffirmed the commitment to the cooperative approach agreed at the recent Paris meeting. They agreed, however, that further actions will be essential to resist rising protectionist pressures, sustain global economic expansion and reduce trade imbalances."     It welcomed the plans set this week by the Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party to stimulate its economy with what the communique termed "extraordinary and urgent measures" including an "unprecedented front-end loading of public works expenditures."     The meeting of the so-called Group of Seven brought together ministers and central bank governors of the seven major industrial democracies, the United States, Japan, West Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada.     The communique said the ministers reaffirmed the commitment on cooperation reached in a meeting on February 22 in Paris when they had agreed to stabilize foreign exchange rates at the then-current levels.     In the weeks that followed, the dollar continued to fall against the Japanese yen despite massive dollar purchases by the Bank of Japan and other central banks and is now trading at around postwar lows.     Japan has come under growing criticism from both the United States and European countries for its only modest efforts to open its markets to outside competition and to reduce its exports.     The communique said Japan affirmed its intention to open domestic markets to foreign goods and services but did not elaborate.     It said the officials "reaffirmed the view that around current levels their currencies are within ranges broadly consistent with economic fundamentals and the basic policy intentions outlined at the Louvre meeting."

19870409	FUNDAMENTAL BROKERS BUYS PART OF MKI BROKERS Fundamental Brokers Institutional Associates, a leading inter-dealer broker in U.S. government securities, said it has agreed to acquire certain assets of MKI Government Brokers Inc for undisclosed terms.     Acquisition documents have been signed and are being held in escrow pending the receipt of certain consents, it said.     In conjunction with the sale of assets, MKI has ceased brokering treasury bills, notes and bonds, Fundamental said.     Industry sources told Reuters yesterday that Fundamental was close to acquiring the government securities brokerage division of MKI, a major broker of corporate bonds.     Fundamental said it intends to use the facilities formerly used by MKI to provide a new block brokering service in the most active Treasury issues.     By separating the execution of wholesale trades from the heavy volume of smaller lots, large-scale transactions will be facilitated, the company said.     "The new system is expected to substantially enhance the liquidity and effiency of markets," Fundamental said.     The wholesale brokering service will begin on or around April 20.  Reuter 3;
19870409	G-7 ISSUES STATEMENT AFTER MEETING Following is the text of a statement by the Group of Seven -- the U.S., Japan, West Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada -- issued after a Washington meeting yesterday.     1. The finance ministers and central bank governors of seven major industrial countries met today.     They continued the process of multilateral surveillance of their economies pursuant to the arrangements for strengthened economic policy coordination agreed at the 1986 Tokyo summit of their heads of state or government.     The managing director of the International Monetary Fund also participated in the meeting.     2. The ministers and governors reaffirmed the commitment to the cooperative approach agreed at the recent Paris meeting, and noted the progress achieved in implementing the undertakings embodied in the Louvre Agreement.     They agreed, however, that further actions will be essential to resist rising protectionist pressures, sustain global economic expansion, and reduce trade imbalances.     In this connection they welcomed the proposals just announced by the governing Liberal Democratic Party in Japan for extraordinary and urgent measures to stimulate Japan's economy through early implementation of a large supplementary budget exceeding those of previous years, as well as unprecedented front-end loading of public works expenditures.     The government of Japan reaffirmed its intention to further open up its domestic markets to foreign goods and services.     3. The ministers and governors reaffirmed the view that around current levels their currencies are within ranges broadly consistent with economic fundamentals and the basic policy intentions outlined at the Louvre meeting.     In that connection they welcomed the strong implementation of the Louvre Agreement.     They concluded that present and prospective progress in implementing the policy undertakings at the Louvre and in this statement provided a basis for continuing close cooperation to foster the stability of exchange rates.

19870409	G-7 WANTS TO SHOW MARKETS ITS RESOLVE - MIYAZAWA Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said the Group of Seven (G-7) countries reaffirmed their Paris accord on stabilising currencies to convince the market of their resolve.     At a news conference after today's G-7 meeting, Miyazawa said the ministers and central bank governors did not believe a totally new statement was needed.     The speculative selling did not reflect economic fundamentals, and since the fundamentals had not changed only a reaffirmation of the goals of the Paris accord was needed, he said.     He also noted that this test of the G-7 nations resolve had concentrated on the yen, while other currencies, especially the mark, had remained stable.     Miyazawa said any change in economic conditions since the Paris accord was not worth being called fundamental.     "As I said at a time of Louvre (agreement), the expression of 'current level' is rather vague idea," he said.     The yen's movement in the past several weeks is within the range agreed in Paris in Febraury, he said.     It was better to give a vague expression than pin-pointing a level, which could have an adverse impact on the market, Miyazawa said.     Asked why only Japan was committed to fresh measures in the statement, he said Japan was exceptional among the seven because the yen appreciated against the dollar while other major currencies largely have been stable.     He also said Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party has justed adoped a package to reflate the economy while other nations are not supposed to produce new measures in a short period since the Paris agreement.     Miyazawa also said the U.S. sanctions against Japanese semiconductor products was not discussed through the G-7 meeting and did not affect the currency talks.     The seven nations discussed the debt problems of developing countries and ways to proceed in line with the debt initiative outlined by U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker 18 months ago.  REUTER 3;

19870409	GERMAN BANKERS' REMARKS REVIVE TALK OF RATE CUT Remarks by two leading central bankers sparked renewed speculation in financial markets that a cut in the West German three pct discount rate may be under discussion, currency dealers said.     Bundesbank board member Claus Koehler said in a speech that monetary growth resulting from speculative capital inflows required cuts in interest rates.     Separately, West Berlin state central bank president Dieter Hiss told journalists that the discount rate could fall below its lowest ever point of 2.75 pct. He made clear that he was not making a forecast on interest rates, however.     Currency dealers here and in the Far East said the dollar gained slight background support from the speculation.     But German dealers noted that the Bundesbank kept the 3.80 pct rate unchanged at which it offered liquidity to the money market this week, dashing some expectations that it may either offer lower fixed rate money or offer a reduced minimum rate and let the strength of banks' demands set the allocation rate.     It allocated 6.1 billion marks in new liquidity, much less than the 14.9 billion leaving the market as a prior pact expired. This further weakened sentiment the Bundesbank could move to a more accommodative monetary stance, dealers said.     Koehler said in a speech in Surrey, England, speculative capital inflows may cause monetary growth, regardless of whether central banks intervened or exchange rates fell.     "In other words, the monetary policy measures required are different from -- and sometimes diametrically opposed to -- those needed when the money stock is increasing as a result of mounting economic activity."     Though Koehler was known to be the most liberal of the generally monetarist Bundesbank board, his comments marked the first time cuts in rates had been concretely suggested as a counterpoint to overly strong monetary growth, dealers said. REUTER^M 3;
19870409	GERMAN MONEY MARKET SPLIT ON LOWER RATE PROSPECTS Remarks by central bankers raised some hopes the Bundesbank will cut rates on securities repurchase pacts, but operators remained divided on the likelihood of a move in the near term, money market dealers said.     Comments by Bundesbank board member Claus Koehler yesterday that rate cuts were needed to curb money supply growth from speculative capital inflows, and by West Berlin state central bank president Dieter Hiss that there was no natural lower limit to the discount rate had, however, no immediate impact.     Call money declined to 3.65/75 pct from 3.75/85 pct but the drop was tied to extra liquidity in the market, dealers said.     Dealers said the Bundesbank's latest liquidity allotment this week dashed some hopes of lower rates.     The Bundesbank allotted only 6.1 billion marks yesterday in new liquidity in a repurchase pact at an unchanged rate of 3.80 pct, thus subtracting some 8.8 billion marks from the market, as an outgoing 14.9 billion pact expired.     But some dealers said the smaller volume awarded by the pact was in line with present liquid money market conditions, and did not exlude a cut in the repurchase pact rate soon to 3.70 pct if money market rates continue at present levels.     The next opportunity for the Bundesbank to lower rates on repurchase pacts will be in a tender expected next Tuesday.     Bundesbank officials have already said they favour more discreet rate adjustments through repurchase pacts, rather than the more public adjustment of leading rates.     The Bundesbank may either set a fixed allocation rate and allow banks to tender for the volume, as has been the case since it lowered its discount rate January 22, or else it may allow banks to tender for the rate and set the volume itself.     Dealers expect volume of the tender to be lower than the 15.2 billion marks flowing out, to offset other incoming funds.     Some seven billion marks is expected to flow in next week. This should then flow back into the market as it is deposited with banks.     Banks were well supplied with liquidity, holding 61.5 billion marks in reserves at the Bundesbank on Tuesday.     Holdings of average daily reserves over the first seven days of April stood at 59.6 billion marks, still above the estimated 51 billion required for all of April.  REUTER 3;

19870409	GLOBAL ECONOMIC SLOWDOWN RAISES NEW DEBT FEARS The global economy is expected to weaken this year, adding new worries to an already serious poverty outlook, economic analysts said.     For finance ministers and central bankers attending this week's semi-annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank, the new figures released by the IMF add an additional concern.     The Fund estimated world output would only grow by 2.7 pct this year, versus 2.9 pct last year, and 3.1 pct in 1985.     In the industrial countries, Gross National Product, a measure of all goods and services, was expected to decline to 2.3 pct this year, compared with 2.4 pct in 1986, the IMF said.     For the developing countries, the Gross Domestic Product, another measure of economic growth, was expected to fall to 3.0 pct from 3.5 pct last year.     The new figures are considered a major disappointment to the poorest countries. They had hoped that new vitality in the industrial countries brought on by a sharp decline in oil prices would assist their economic recovery and help them cope with growing mounds of debt.     IMF officials, discussing their outlook, said they believed the industrial country economies would move up to an annual growth rate of three pct by the end of the decade.     Economic analysts and the IMF have been saying for some time that the ability to keep the debt crisis from turning into an economic rout rests on sustained economic growth.     Since the debtor countries must look to the wealthier states for markets for their products as well as financial assistance, economic weakness in the developed nations'  economies poses fundamental worries.     Debtor countries, including the very poorest states, have only a few avenues open to them for earning foreign exchange, including the key one of exports.     The U.S. economy, which is in its fifth year of expansion, has served as a mainstay for developing country exports, but it too is seen as being rather feeble this year, growing by only 2.3 pct, according to the IMF.     For this reason and because of a high trade deficit, the United States has been pressuring Japan and West Germany to ignite their economies but with little apparent success.     The IMF study also examines the course of the dollar and the curious lack of impact it has had on the U.S. trade deficit.     Reagan administration officials have been saying that the impact is now beginning to show up, although it has been much slower than expected.     The IMF observed in its World Economic Outlook that "it has to be recognized that exchange rate adjustments take time to work through to payments flows -- probably at least three years to get a resonably complete effect."     The report added, however, "the adjustments may take even more time on this occasion." REUTER^M 3;

19870409	HOUSE PANEL WANTS PENTAGON MANAGE U.S. STOCKPILE The House Armed Services Committee has voted for a transfer in the management of stockpiled materials for national defense to the U.S. Defense Secretary.     The committee also voted for legally-binding quantity and quality requirements on the materials, mostly metals.     The measures are a part of the Defense Authorization Bill which will be voted on in the House next month.     The purpose of the measures, passed by the committee yesterday, is to improve stockpile management and discourage sell-offs of materials that could jeopardize strategic needs, a staff member of the committee told Reuters.     "They (the stockpiles) stand to gain the most by being managed properly," said the staffer. "Management of the stockpile over the last 10 years has been atrocious."     Responsibility for stockpile management now belongs to a White House agency, the Federal Emergency Management Agency.     The staffer said under the measures passed by the committee the Secretary of Defense would have more influence over decisions to keep or sell strategic stockpile materials.     The administration has proposed a goal of 700 million dlrs worth of strategic materials to be held in the stockpile. The stockpile now contains around 10 billion dlrs of materials.     He said several agencies currently helped FEMA to manage the stockpile and decide how much to sell to help the deficit.     These agencies included the Office of Management and Budget and the Departments of Interior and Commerce, he said.     The committee believed the shared involvement in stockpile management was counter-productive, he said.  Reuter 3;

19870409	IDA GIVES 18.6 MLN DLR LOAN TO SRI LANKA The International Development Association (IDA) is lending 18.6 mln dlrs to Sri Lanka for agricultural research and development, the World Bank said in a statement.     The loan is part of a 26.5 mln dlr project to improve production of commodities, mainly rice, and raise farmer incomes. Other financing for the project will come from Sri Lanka (7.1 mln dlrs) and West Germany (800,000 dlrs).     The IDA credit is interest-free and for 50 years. It includes a 10-year grace period but has annual charges of 0.5 pct on the undisbursed balance, and 0.75 pct on the disbursed balance, the Bank statement said.     The project envisages the creation of a Council of Agricultural Research to formulate a national agricultural strategy and introduce a contract research programme to finance research activities, the Bank said.

19870409	INDIA FOODGRAIN TARGET 160 MLN TONNES IN 1987/88 India's national foodgrain target has been fixed at 160 mln tonnes in 1987/88 (Apr-Mar), unchanged from the 1986/87 target, the Agriculture Ministry said in its annual report for 1986/87.     Actual output was estimated at 151 mln tonnes in 1986/87 due to failure of monsoon rains in 15 out of 35 meterological sub-divisions of the country.     The report gave the targets for various crops with estimated harvested crops in 1986/87 in brackets as following, in mln tonnes - rice 65 (60), wheat 49 (49), coarse grains including sorghum and millets 32 (29) and pulses 14 (13).     Despite failure of monsoon rains in recent years, it was possible to maintain higher foodgrain production, signifying growing resilience in agricultural sector, the report said.     The strategy for increasing irrigation potential along with greater use of high yielding seed varieites and improvement in fertiliser efficiency is yielding results, it said, adding total foodgrain output in 1985/86, 1984/85 and 1983/84 respectively was 150.5 mln tonnes, 145.5 mln and a record 152.4 mln.    India has targeted to produce between 178 and 183 mln tonnes of foodgrains by the last year of the seventh five-year development plan ending March 31, 1990.     Taking the midpoint of 180 mln tonnes as the target and the 1986/87 estimated production of around 151 mln tonnes, the gap of 29 mln tonnes has to be made up during the remaining three years of the plan by increasing grain output annually by more than nine mln tonnes. But the target can be achieved only with good weather, the report said.     "The major thrust programme will, therefore, be better water (irrigation) management. Simultaneously, efforts for spread of improved technology including timely use of inputs (farm materials like fertilisers) in adequate quantities have to be vigrously pursued," it said.  Reuter 3;
19870409	INDIA OILSEED OUTPUT FORECAST TO RISE India's oilseed output is expected to rise to 12.25 mln tonnes in 1986/87 ending October, up on 11.15 mln in 1985/86 but down from 12.95 mln harvested in 1984/85, the Agriculture Ministry's 1986/87 report said.     But the forecast for 1986/87 is well below a target of 14.8 mln tonnes fixed for the year, it said, adding bad weather hit groundnut and other oilseed crops.     The National Oilseeds Development Program will invest 300 mln rupees in 1986/87 on supplying improved high-yielding seeds and other support services to help boost production, it added. India imports about 1.2 mln tonnes of edible oils a year.  Reuter 3;
19870409	INDIAN STATE COMPANY BONDS PROVOKE COMPLAINTS India's private businessmen say they have been placed on an unequal footing in raising money from the capital market because government companies are wooing investors by issuing more attractive tax-free bonds.     Stock brokers and bankers polled by Reuters said although equity shares or debenture issues floated by private firms provide a higher return and shorter maturity, they are fast losing their popular appeal as they are liable to both wealth and income taxes.     Brokers said many investors are transferring funds into government company bonds because of their tax-free status and easy transferability.     About 100 private companies have postponed plans to issue equity shares and debentures in the first quarter of fiscal 1987/88 partly on account of fierce competition from public sector bonds, a merchant banker said.     They included equity shares and rights issue worth one billion rupees planned to be issued this month by Tata Fertilisers Ltd, he said, adding the issue has been postponed indefinitely.     "The government bonds are making serious inroads on the private sector companies' resources," said R. P. Goenka, president of the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry.     "The discriminatory tax treatment should be done away with and equal facilities be provided to the two sectors to mobilise resources from the market which is common to both," Goenka said.     A senior Finance Ministry official said government and private firms were free to compete to raise resources, adding it was not correct that public sector-issued bonds were preventing private firms from raising money on the stock market.     "Debentures and equity shares floated by private companies still account for at least 60 pct of total capital raised in stock exchanges," the ministry official said.     A spokesman at Bombay stock brokers Batliwala and Karani said government bonds were valued at about 20 billion rupees or about 40 pct of 50 billion rupees raised by both government and non-government firms in the domestic capital market in 1986/87.     The share was 35 to 40 pct of about 36.95 billion rupees mobilised in 1985/86, he said. "To save taxes, commercial banks, mainly foreign banks, and some private companies, are investing their surplus funds in the tax free bonds," he said.     "Individuals who are very well off are also investing in the bonds to gain tax benefits while only small investors are going for equities or debentures floated by private companies on a selective basis," the spokesman said.     The maturity period of government company bonds varies between seven and 10 years. No wealth or income taxes are payable on nine pct seven-year bonds but those carrying 13 pct interest on 10-year bonds are subjected to income tax if interest amount^M exceeds 7,000 rupees a year.     Equity shares, the 14 pct non-convertible debentures and 12.5 to 14 pct convertible debentures issued by private companies are not exempted from either the wealth tax or from the tax on income earned from them.     The government bonds are listed as securities but traded on India's four major stock exchanges. They can be sold freely on the stock market by simple endorsement while debentures can only be sold to the company after one year, brokers said.     Government companies are trying to capitalise on a boom in the stock market since 1984/85 sparked by liberal tax concessions and reforms in exchange operations, brokers said.     The National Thermal Power Corp, NTPC, was the first government company to issue the bonds to raise one billion rupees in January last year, breaking the monopoly of private companies on the capital market. The seven-year NTPC bond was oversubscribed three times, brokers said.     Official figures show bonds floated by government companies have been heavily oversubscribed. More state companies have sought the Ministry's permission to issue them in coming months.     NTPC's second bond issue at the end of 1986 raised 4.51 billion rupees against 1.2 billion originally permitted by the Finance Ministry.     The Mahanagar Telephone Nigam mobilised 3.83 billion rupees last year against authorised 1.5 billion and last month the Indian Railway Finance Corporation's record susbcription totalled 5.5 billion rupees against authorised 2.5 billion.     In most cases, the government has allowed the companies to maintain the oversubscribed amount, brokers said.     Goenka said that government bonds are making it increasingly difficult for private companies to launch new equity or debenture issues. He said the government could at least "fix a suitable limit on the funds to be raised through such bonds by the public sector."     Merchant bankers said the government is pressing state companies to borrow from the public by reducing financial support to them.     To ease its internal debt burden, the government has reduced the budgetary support to development investment in about 120 public sector companies to 69.92 billion rupees in 1987/88 from 77.92 billion a year earlier, official figures show.

19870409	IRT PROPERTY LAUNCHES DEBENTURE IN EUROMARKET IRT Property Co, a real estate investment trust based in Atlanta, Georgia, has launched a 30 mln dlr convertible subordinated debenture in the Euromarket, a partner of Chandler Partnership Ltd said.     The issue is unique in several respects and is only one of a handful of such deals to be brought to this market, he said.     Unlike most eurobonds, the issue will not be underwritten. Instead, IRT mandated Chandler Partnership to find potential investors with whom the issue can be preplaced and to then place on a "best efforts" basis what ever amount may not be subscribed.     Chandler itself was set up in the Isle of Jersey in the middle of last year as a partnership, whose members have been involved in financial markets.     The deal has two sponsors who assist in the placement-- Interallianz Bank Zurich AG and Nivison Cantrade Ltd, a small U.K. Trading firm that formerly was broker R. Nivison and Co.     The debentures are due June 1, 2002 and pay a semi-annual coupon of two pct and are priced at par. They can be converted into shares of the company's stock at 23-1/2 dlrs a share.     IRT's shares closed last night on the New York Stock Exchange at 19-7/8.     The debentures can be redeemed at par at maturity and are callable at the company's option after the first two years.     On or after August 1989 the company can call half the debentures if the stock trades for 30 days at 123 pct of the conversion price and half if it reaches 140 pct of the conversion price, Nivison said.     In addition, holders will be able to surrender half the bonds during May 1991 at 123 pct for a semi-annual yield of 7.043 pct and the other half in May 1993 at 140 pct, for a yield of 7.383 pct.     The payment date is June 1, 1987. The debentures will be listed in London and the fees for the deal total 2-1/4 pct.     Nivison said that the deal contains a convenent which states that if the company's debt to equity ratio exceeds two to one the debentures cannot be converted unless the company obtains a bank guarantee or a letter of credit.     Nivison said IRT's debt to equity ratio currently is less than one to one.     The Chandler partner said that this type of deal gives the borrower funds that are less costly than if it had done an issue in the U.S. Domestic market.  REUTER 3;

19870409	JAPAN HAS NO PLANS TO CUT DISCOUNT RATE Bank of Japan sources said the bank has no plans to cut its discount rate.     They told reporters that there was no pressure on Japan during the Group of Seven (G-7) meeting here yesterday to lower its discount rate. They added that they themselves do not feel any need for a cut at all.     Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson told reporters earlier today that some countries - those with strong currencies - might have to cut interest rates.     The Bank of Japan sources also said that it was too soon to call the G-7 pact a failure.     The central bank sources were commenting on the dollar's renewed tumble in New York and Tokyo, which was sparked by remarks by U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker that the dollar's fall had been orderly.     They said the market must have misinterpreted Baker's comments because he was referring to the dollar's fall since the Plaza agreement in September 1985, over a long-time span, not the currency's recent movements.     They added that the foreign exchange markest seem to seize on anything to use as an excuse to drive the dollar one way or the other.     The Bank of Japan sources said the U.S. Is putting more weight on the dollar/yen rate in terms of judging market stability than on other currencies.     Throughout the G-7 meeting, Japan pointed to the dangers that would arise from a further dollar fall because it would reduce the flow of Japanese capital to the U.S., Hurting the U.S. And world economies, they said.     In February and in March of this year, Japanese investors reduced their purchases of U.S. Treasury bonds, the sources said.     Each country in the G-7 - Britain, Canada, France, Italy, Japan, the U.S. And West Germany - has a different view about currency stability, the Bank of Japan sources said.     This is because the overall foreign exchange market is a triangle of dollar/yen, European currencies/yen and dollar/European currencies.     At the time of the Louvre agreement, European countries did not want the yen to weaken against their currencies so they did not object to the yen strengthening, they said.  REUTER 3;

19870409	LAWSON SAYS SOME COUNTRIES COULD CUT RATES Nigel Lawson, Britain's Chancellor of the Exchequer, said some countries may need to cut interest rates with the aim of maintaining exchange rate stability.     Speaking to journalists one day after the Group of Seven countries reaffirmed goals set in Paris six weeks ago, he said central banks would continue to intervene "as and when necessary."     He said the G-7 countries were concerned that Japan do more to stimulate domestic demand and welcomed measures outlined by Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa yesterday.     Lawson said he was still worried about  the risk of a simultaneous recession in the United States, Japan and West Germany, though less so than when he gave his March 17 budget speech to the British Parliament.     "If anything I'm a little bit less concerned, but there is still a risk," he said.     Asked if the United States should consider increasing interest rates to support the dollar, he said, "If there is a need for changes in relative interest rates, it doesn't need to be a rise in interest rates in the United States."     Lawson said there was some concern expressed in yesterday's meetings at the slow progress the United States had made in reducing its budget deficit.     "We believe there will be some worthwhile progress in reducing the deficit this year. The important thing is that it continue year after year," Lawson said.     The February 22 Louvre accord called for efforts to stabilize currencies at then-current exchange rates. In the six weeks that followed the Japanese yen continued to rise against the dollar despite massive central bank intervention.     Asked whether this intervention was a sign of weakness in the Louvre accord, he said, "I don't think so. If there had been no intervention you would have called that a sign of weakness."     Although intervention could be a cause of inflation, Lawson said, "the world does not appear to be in an inflationary mode ... but one has to be vigilant."     He said yesterday's G-7 statement, which affirmed that "current levels" of exchange rates were appropriate, had been "carefully worded." "We know what we mean, and we all mean the same thing," he said.     Lawson said financial markets seem to believe that Japanese measures outlined in the Louvre accord were the source of weakness for that agreement.     Therefore, the G-7 countries welcomed Miyazawa's presentation of plans for a supplemental budget to stimulate domestic demand.     They particularly welcomed the goal of an immediate increase in public works spending, but Lawson said the package also involved a second stage to increase expenditures during the second half of this year.

This buoyancy is generally attributed by traders to the low level of LME stocks and steady, if unspectacular, physical demand in the Northern Hemisphere finding supplies curtailed.     The supply problems are not new but are beginning to be felt by a market in which, as peak winter demand tails off, stocks usually build fast and availability increases, traders said.     The lower supply levels result from a number of different factors around the globe.     Delayed shipments from Peru to Mediterranean countries because of production and transport problems, lack of Spanish exports since the closure last year of Cia La Cruz's smelter at Linares and lower output in Morocco and Greece have all meant additional demand being directed to merchants who in turn have been drawing on LME stocks.     In addition Broken Hill Associated Smelters' Port Pirie, South Australia, smelter is halting production for five weeks for maintenance. Although the company said it would meet commitments, this will put further pressure on stocks.     And the U.S. Company Doe Run has kept its 140,000 tonnes per year Boss, Montana smelter closed. This cut producer stocks and contributed to a closer supply/demand balance within the U.S. Market, for many years depressed by surplus production and a regular supplier to the world market.     Mexican supplies, which have sometimes swelled LME stocks, have been normal but are finding ready buyers, traders said.     On the demand side, winter battery manufacture has held up quite well and some U.S. Buying of lead sheet has been reported in the U.K. Soviet lead buying, notably absent in Europe in the first two months of the year, was resumed when a large buying order was filled by merchants in March.     Merchant demand has fuelled the rise in LME lead prices this week and has seen cash metal move above 320 stg and establish a premium of around 10 stg over three months delivery. Specific demand has been directed towards metal in Gothenburg and Trieste warehouses. Gothenburg material is often a target for merchants shipping to the USSR, traders said.     On stocks, the popular LME Continental warehouses, Antwerp and Rotterdam, have little more than 3,000 tonnes of lead each, and this is believed to be in strong hands.     Out of a total 22,125 tonnes in LME stocks, the lowest level since June 1980, just over half is in U.K. Warehouses which are not popular with merchants putting together shipments.     But even U.K. Stocks have dropped around 6,000 tonnes since the start of the year. Traders said this is partly due to secondary smelters buying ingots to supplement feed supplies affected by environmental controls, which put restrictions on the transport of used batteries.     Labour negotiations in North America will play an important part in determining the direction of prices, with contracts expiring end-April at Cominco's Trail and Kimberley, B.C., Mine/smelter and at Doe Run's Herculaneum, Mo, smelter.     Noranda's New Brunswick mine/smelter also has a contract expiry in July which may cause some nervousness in view of strikes by its zinc and copper workers over recent months.     Traders said LME three months delivery, already attracting speculative buying, could rise to 320/330 stg on current firmness, while nearby tightness could widen the cash premium to 20 from four. Three months was quoted at 313 stg at midsession.  Reuter 3;
19870409	LEBANESE POUND FALLS SHARPLY AGAINST DOLLAR The Lebanese Pound fell sharply against the U.S. Dollar again today with dealers attributing the decline to continued political uncertainty.     The pound closed at 118.25/118.75 against the dollar compared to yesterday's close of 115.60/115.80.     "Political deadlock is reflected in the pound's position. There was more demand and less on offer in the market," one dealer told Reuters.     The pound, which was at 18 to the dollar in January, 1986, has lost more than 30 pct of its international value over the past three months.  REUTER 3;
19870409	LEX SERVICE BUYS SEARS MOTOR GROUP Lex Service Plc <LEXL.L> said it had acquired <Sears Motor Group Ltd>, the retail motor distribution arm of Sears Plc < SEHL.L>, and an 11.9 mln stg loan note payable by Sears Motor for 33.4 mln stg.     The purchase will be through 1.4 mln stg in cash and the issue to Sears Plc of 8.0 mln new Lex ordinary shares.     The company said in a statement that immediately following the acquisition of the motor group, its car and commercial vehicle contract hire fleet of some 3,000 vehicles was sold to <Lex Vehicle Leasing Ltd> for 14.3 mln stg in cash, a sum equal to the net book value of the vehicles transferred.     Lex Vehicle is owned equally by Lex Services and <Lombard North Central Plc>.     Lex said the shares involved in the transaction were today being placed for Sears Plc with institutions at 400p. These shares will not qualify for the final Lex dividend on 10 April.     Lex said in a statement that its acquisition of Sears Motor Group represents a major development for its automotive activities. The enlarged retailing operations of the Lex Automotive group now have a turnover of 530 mln stg. Lex's existing automotive interests include Volvo Concessionaires, the sole importer of Volvo cars and parts into the U.K.     Lex said the turnover for Sears Motor Group in the year to 31 December 1986 was 242 mln stg and that at the date of the acquisition the group had about 50 mln stg in external borrowings.     Lex shares fell on the announcement to trade around 409p from a 419p close yesterday.  REUTER 3;
19870409	LONDON EURODOLLAR BONDS CLOSE LOWER Eurodollar bonds closed as much as a full point lower as the dollar fell to a post-war low against the yen and interest rates on U.S. Treasuries rose almost to eight pct.     The dollar fell to 144.30 yen and recovered only slightly after foreign exchange traders in New York said the Federal Reserve intervened to buy dollars for yen.     But despite the dollar's woes, Japan Development Bank, wholly owned by the Japanese government, raised 150 mln dlrs in a seven-year eurobond carrying an eight pct coupon.     Lead manager for the issue, Bank of Tokyo, said the deal, at the time of pricing, was to yield 60 basis points over comparable maturity Treasuries. However, by the close of trading, that spread had narrowed to 55 and continued to slide in aftermarket activity.     Dealers noted that the spread to Treasuries is wide for a newly-priced AAA-rated borrower like Japan Development Bank. For example, earlier this week, the World Bank raised U.S. Dlrs at only 25 basis points over Treasuries. Dealers said that because the borrower comes to market fairly infrequently -- the last time was about nine months ago, the spread appears wide.     But officials at Bank of Tokyo said the spread is intended to compensate for the lack of liquidity and for the uncertainty currently associated with owning dollar securities.     The officials said the borrower opted to raise funds in dollars, despite the currency's weakness, because it is the only market deep enough to accommodate an issue of that size. Japan Development Bank is not allowed to raise euroyen.     Market sources said the deal is likely to be swapped into yen as the borrowers previous issues were.     Late in the day, the deal was trading just inside its fees at less 1.75 less 1.55.     Also issued today was a 40 mln dlr five-year offering from Toshiba International Finance (Netherlands) carrying a 7-3/8 pct coupon and priced at 101-1/2.     Three equity linked dollar denominated deals were offered, the largest of which was a 200 mln dlr offering by Sekisui Chemical Co and guaranteed by Sanwa Bank Ltd. The issue has equity warrants attached and late in the day it was quoted on brokers' screens at 106-1/2, bid only.     The Australian dollar market continued active, with Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce offering a bond of 125 mln five-year with a zero coupon priced at 54.     Late in the day, the deal was quoted at less 1-1/4 bid. A similar deal yesterday by Toronto Dominion, priced slightly higher at 54.37 pct for an effective yield of 13.52 pct, was quoted slightly lower at less 1.37 less 1.25 pct.     Dealers said that investors are apparently willing to accept zero-coupon bonds yielding 50 to 100 basis points less than annual-pay bonds because their are tax benefits for retail buyers. Also, the bonds are more volatile and if interest rates fall in Australia as many analysts expect, the potential for capital gains is greater with a zero-coupon. The bonds are also better for those who expect the australian dlr to appreciate.     Dealers said that the Australia dlr zero coupon bonds are apparently being placed with retail accounts on the European continent with very little placement being done in Japan.     Euroyen issues sank slightly in line with prices on domestic Japanese bond markets but recovered in late trade as the yen soared. After the markets closed, the dollar fell to 144 yen.     The European Investment Bank (EIB) issued a 40 mln euroyen issue paying 4-5/8 pct over seven years. This is the second seven-year yen issue in two days -- a sector of the yield curve in Japan that dealers feel has not yet become overpriced.  REUTER 3;

19870409	MAJOR RUBBER PRODUCERS TO MEET IN SINGAPORE Officials from Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore and, perhaps, Thailand will meet here tomorrow to discuss increased regional cooperation on rubber marketing and ways to raise rubber prices, industry sources said.     The officials will discuss linking rubber markets in the four countries to improve price transparency, the sources said.     This is the first time Indonesia is attending such a meeting, they said, but representatives from Thailand may not be able to attend because of their tight schedule. Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand account for 90 pct of world rubber exports and Singapore is a major regional rubber trading centre.     The Malaysian Rubber Futures market, freighting and contracts for rubber are among other issues expected to be discussed.     Last month, rubber importing and exporting countries adopted a new International Natural Rubber Agreement in Geneva. The new pact is more responsive to market trends than its predecessor, the sources said, and earlier provisions allowing the buffer stock to borrow from banks have been eliminated.  REUTER 3;

The company said the next three consecutive quarters should demonstrate "excellent earnings growth."  Reuter 3;
19870409	NATIONAL DISTILLERS <DR> SEES SECOND QTR GAIN National Distillers and Chemical Corp expects to realize a second quarter after-tax gain of four dlrs per share from the 545 mln dlr sale of its spirits business to American Brands Inc <AMB>.     National Distillers' stock rose 1-1/8 to 65-1/2, after an opening delay on the New York Stock exchange for an imbalance of orders.     "I think the sales price was higher than most people expected," said John Henry of E.F. Hutton Group.     A company spokeswoman said the four dlr per share gain will be included in second quarter net, which compares with 31 cts per share last year, including the spirits and wine business     "They netted over 700 mln dlrs for spirits and wine. That will ease their interest cost burden," said Henry.     National Distillers sold its wine business last month to Grand Metropolitan PLC's Heublein Inc for 128 mln dlrs.     Henry said he had anticipated National Distillers would net only 600 mln dlrs at the most from the sale of the two liquor businesses.     Henry said the company recovered from the sales the cost of buying Enron Chemicals in the fourth quarter last year. National Distillers paid 570 mln dlrs cash for Enron and assumed 34 mln dlrs in debt. National Distillers said at the time it bought Enron it would sell the spirits and wine businesses, moving more into the chemical area.     For 1986, two thirds of income were from chemicals and propane. National Distillers earned, excluding the liquor businesses, 2.21 dlrs per share for 1986. Income from discontinued operations, including the liquor businesses, was 67 cts per share.  Reuter 3;

The international share in turnover was 50 pct in 1986 compared with 52 pct in 1985.     The company's life insurance result fell to 365.7 mln guilders after 428.4 mln in 1985 due to currency influences, tighter interest margins and increased investment.

Another 56 miners were trapped underground for as long as 24 hours before they were brought to safety.

Noranda estimated that the securing operation for the zone will not be completed before the end of April.     Noranda said the Quebec Health and Safety Commission, the Quebec Provincial Police and Noranda itself are each conducting an investigation into the fire.     Production at the mine has been suspended until the investigations are complete. The copper mine and smelter produced 72,000 tons of copper anodes in 1986 and employs 680 people.

19870409	PHILIPPINE TELEPHONE FIRM PLANS STOCK SPLIT The Philippine Long Distance Telephone Co <PLDT.MN> is planning a two-for-one stock split and a 20 pct stock dividend later this year to reduce excess market buoyancy, Vice-President Sennen Lazo told Reuters.     Lazo said the stock split would reduce the par value of the company's common stock from 10 to five pesos.     He said the stock split would apply to holders of about 18 mln common shares of stock on the record date of September 15 1987. "The exercise should make our stock more marketable," Lazo said. "Now it is beyond the reach of many small investors."     PLDT common stock surged from a low of 37 pesos in February 1986 to 367.50 at close of trading yesterday on the Manila Stock Exchange.     Lazo said the 20 pct stock dividend, payable on October 15, would also apply to stockholders on record as of September 15.     PLDT reported 1986 net income of 1.89 billion pesos, up 68 pct from 778.9 mln pesos in 1985, on operating revenues of six billion pesos, up from 4.7 billion pesos in 1985.     At end December 1986 the company had 417,100 stockholders.     A PLDT spokesman said the company's profits are likely to be substantial since the government raised its franchise tax to three pct from two and to impose a 35 pct corporate income tax from which it was previously exempt.     The government has not so far ordered the implementation of the tax decision.     PLDT is the largest of 58 telephone companies in the Philippines. On December 31 1986 the company had 856,014 telephones in operation, representing 94 pct of all instruments in the country.

19870409	PHYSIO TECHNOLOGY <PHYT> SEES LOSS, IN DEFAULT Physio Technology Inc said it expects to have a third quarter, ended March 31, loss of about 200,000 dlrs and is in default on its bank loan because of the resignation of chairman and chief executive officer.     The company said the loss followed four quarters of modest profits. In the year ago quarter it earned 11,000 dlrs, or one cent a share. For the first half of fiscal 1987, it reported a profit of 42,000 dlrs, or two cts a share, compared to a year earlier loss of 294,000 dlrs, or 17 cts a share.     It said President Michael R. Hall will assume the duties of chief executive officer.     Physio Technology said the resignation of Chairman James C. Lane can constitute non-compliance with its Series A convertible subordinated debentures due 1996 and a default under its agreement with the Merchants Bank of Kansas City.     It explained a declaration of non-compliance under the debentures would create a a default under the loan agreements requiring immediate payment of 1.8 mln dlrs of debentures and about 450,000 dlrs outstanding under the bank credit line.     The company said the debenture holders intend to waive the non-compliance, but reserve the right to withdraw the waiver at the end of any 30 day period.     Physio Technology said it is changing its field sales force to independent representatives and dealers from employees to "significantly reduce its fixed overhead."

19870409	REICHHOLD CHEMICAL <RCI> SETS ANTI-TAKEOVER PLAN Reichhold Chemical Inc said its board adopted a warrant dividend plan in which one preferred stock purchase right will be distributed as a dividend on each common share outstanding.     The company said its warrant dividend plan is designed to protect its shareholders against unsolicted, coercive attempts to aquire control without making an adequate offer for all shares.     Reichhold said the adoption is not a response to any specific takeover attempt.     Reichhold said each right will entitle shareholders to buy one one-hundreth of a share of a newly created series of preferred stock at an initial exercise price of 120 dlrs, with dividend and voting rights approximately equal to those of one share of the company's common stock.     The rights will be exercisable only if, without Reichhold's prior consent, a person or group a acquires 20 pct or more of the voting power or announces a tender offer which would result in 20 pct ownership, the company said.     Reichhold said it is entitled to redeem the rights at five cts apiece before a 20 pct position has been acquired, or before an existing 20 pct shareholder buys an additional two pct or more of the voting power of the company, or in connection with certain transactions afterward.     The tax-free distribution will become effective May 1, 1987, and will expire 10 years later, the company said.     Details of the plan are outlined in a letter to be mailed to stockholders.

Consumption of some base metals and their dlr prices are showing signs of improvement, although iron ore markets have weakened. The oil price in U.S. Dlrs is above the 1986 average, and if sustained, should improve energy earnings.     The company was commenting in a statement on its 1986 results which, on a restated basis, showed net attributable profits lower at 245 mln stg after 257 mln the previous year. Pretax profits also dipped to 601.7 mln stg after 614.4 mln.     RTZ said the excellent performance of its expanding range of industrial businesses in 1986 was offset by the collapse in oil prices.     Industrial businesses contributed 202 mln stg to net profit, a 40 pct increase from 144 mln in 1985, and 60 pct of the total. Trading performance improved at wholly-owned subsidiaries RTZ Borax Ltd, RTZ Cement Ltd, RTZ Chemicals Ltd and RTZ Pillar Ltd.

19870409	SOVIET UNION TO IMPORT MORE GRAIN IN 86/87-USDA The U.S. Agriculture Department increased its estimate of 1986/87 grain purchases by the Soviet Union to 28 mln tonnes, up two mln tonnes from last month.     In its monthly report on the Soviet grain situation, the USDA said imports will be higher than earlier estimated because Soviet grain buyers have been actively purchasing in the last month.     USDA said the increased purchasing is "somewhat surprising" because of recent higher Soviet crop estimates.     All of the increase in estimated imports will be in corn, USDA said.     Of the 28 mln tonnes total, 15 mln tonnes will be wheat, 12 mln tonnes coarse grains, and the remaining one mln tonnes miscellaneous grains and pulses, USDA said.     USDA noted that the Soviet winter grain crop suffered through a severe winter and spring field work has been delayed.     The severe winter "is believed to have resulted in above average winter-kill," USDA said.     Some grain trade analysts have said abnormal winter losses maybe one reason why the Soviet Union has been actively buying grain recently.     USDA said Moscow already has purchased over 25 mln tonnes grain for delivery in 1986/87, including 14 mln tonnes wheat and 12 mln tonnes coarse grain.  Reuter 3;

Spain's trade deficit narrowed to 581 mln dlrs compared with 664 mln dlrs in January but the large increase in non-oil imports contributed to the substantial increase over the 159 mln dlr deficit registered in February 1986.

Non-oil imports totalled 2.79 billion dlrs compared with 1.91 billion in February last year, reflecting the large ammount of investment goods entering the country with the recovery of the Spanish economy, the Bank of Spain said.

19870409	SPANISH EMPLOYERS WORRIED BY HIGH INTEREST RATES The head of Spain's employers' federation, Jose Maria Cuevas, said employers were worried about the government's monetary policies because high real interest rates were hampering investment.     He told a news conference wage pacts signed so far this year were not endangering the government's five pct inflation target. The government's perceived need to control inflation by keeping a tight rein on credit was unnecessary, he said.     High real interest rates were attracting an influx of speculative foreign capital which was undercutting the government's target for monetary growth, Cuevas said.     Spain's most closely-watched measure of money supply, liquid assets in public hands, grew at an annualised rate of 17 pct in March, against 11.4 pct in December last year and a target range of 6.5 to 9.5 pct for 1987.     To combat this, the Bank of Spain has raised its call money rate 14 times so far this year, to 14.5 pct at present from 11.8 at end-1986.     Cuevas said employers were heeding the government's call to hold wage increases to its five pct inflation target this year, with increases from salary reviews awarded last year and new wage pacts averaging 5.6 pct in the first quarter of 1987.     These agreements covered less than 40 pct of Spanish workers, Cuevas said, with the rest still in wage negotiations.     He said Spain's current wave of strikes mainly affected the state sector, where the government is trying to impose its five pct wage ceiling.     Cuevas said employers were also worried about the trend in Spain's foreign trade balance. The trade deficit in the first two months of 1987 totalled 233 billion pesetas, a 68 pct increase over the corresponding period last year.     However, employers did not favour a devaluation of the peseta to correct the imbalance.  REUTER 3;

19870409	SPRINKEL SAYS TAX HIKE WOULD NOT REDUCE DEFICIT Council of Economic Advisers chairman Beryl Sprinkel said the Reagan Administration remains strongly opposed to a tax increase, including 18 billion dlrs of new revenues in the budget plan by Congressional Democrats.     "We believe that significant increases in taxes would not reduce deficits and could have adverse effects on growth," Sprinkel told the House Rules Committee.     He said the Administration wanted to continue its policy of gradually reducing deficits through restraining government spending and promoting economic growth.

19870409	SWEDISH DRUG FIRM ASTRA RISE ON AIDS HOPES Swedish drug firm AB Astra <ASTS.ST> shares rose 48 crowns to 690 in the first two hours of trading on the Stockholm Bourse, amid hopes its research into anti-viral drugs may have promising results in the treatment of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS).     Stockbrokers said the shares, which climbed amid heavy institutional buying, also rose in reaction to an optimistic assessment of future products in the firm's annual report which was released this week.     Brokers Enskilda Fondkommission said in a report this month that Astra was a world leader in anti-viral drugs.     Although Enskilda said Astra had not made any breakthrough in developing a specific drug to treat the Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome it noted that investors were only now discovering that the firm's approach in the area was promising.     "It is clear that Astra has a tradition in anti-viral research which should prove valuable in fighting this disease," the report by Enskilda, the investment banking unit of Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken <SEBS.ST>, said.

19870409	SWISS AGREE ON NEW PROSPECTUS RULES FOR NOTES Swiss franc notes issued after May 1 must be provided with a prospectus, virtually erasing the difference in information requirements between notes and public bonds, according to a convention drafted by the Bankers' Federation.     The convention requires that lead managers draw up a prospectus naming all syndicate members and providing certain details about the borrower.     In contrast to public issues, though, the prospectus must merely be made available to clients on request via all syndicate banks rather than published and distributed in printed form.     The convention, which was approved by banks earlier this month, replaces an earlier convention dating from 1984 and deals with what had been widely seen as an increasingly anachronistic distinction between notes and public issues.     Its publication follows a long debate among bankers on the amount of information that should be provided by borrowers, heightened by difficulties with Swiss franc issues here on recent occasions .     It applies to all notes in units of at least 50,000 Swiss francs, the usual denomination, which are placed directly with customers by the syndicate and not quoted on the bourse.     Anything smaller than 50,000 francs will be governed by the unchanged, more demanding rules that apply to public issues.     Bankers contacted by Reuters said they did not envisage that the new requirement would present them with problems or push up fees. Many banks said that they had for some time been providing more than the legal minimum of information.     Traditionally, notes or private placements, as they were also known, were medium term instruments denominated in 50,000 francs and placed largely with institutional investors.     They were normally not brought onto the open market and never quoted on the stock exchange.     But over the years the distinction between notes and the publicly quoted and traded bonds gradually broke down. The National Bank therefore last May abolished all remaining restrictions on maturities and denominations which still formally divided them.     However, it was not in the competence of the National Bank to rule on prospectuses and banks have since continued largely as before: public issues, generally quoted on stock exchanges, have been provided with detailed prospectuses, while notes, virtually always not-quoted, have been equipped only with "information memorandums" with varying degrees of detail.     The new convention attempts to put an end to this. It says each notes prospectus must contain the following seven points:     - The precise terms of the issue     - Details of the company performance if it is more than six months since the last annual report     - Naming of all guarantors     - The source of the information     - Details of ratings, insofar as they have been made     - For equity linked notes, details of where the company's shares are listed and price high and lows over at least the last three years.     - That the lead manager has required the borrower to provide information during the lifetime of the notes on the progress of his business.      According to figures from Swiss Bank Corp, total note issues by foreign borrowers reached 18.6 billion Swiss francs last year, compared with 23.6 billion francs borrowed in the form of public bonds.     A majority of the note issues were for Japanese borrowers.  REUTER 3;

19870409	TALKING POINT/STEEL COMPANIES Steel stocks, which have had a healthy runup recently, still present some short term investment opportunities, according to some steel analysts.     But others say the upturn, based on strong orders and firm prices this spring, has been strictly seasonal and will end soon. They recommend taking profits.     "It's that time of year. This is strictly seasonal," said Charles Bradford of Merrill Lynch and Co. "Orders will be strong for about two months, and there are signs that some (order rates) are starting to dive already."     But Dean Witter Reynolds Inc analyst Clarence Morrison sees some short-term potential in the group, which includes USX Corp <X>, Bethlehem Steel Corp <BS>, Armco Inc <AS> and Inland Steel Industries Inc <IAD>.     "There is still some attractiveness to steels over the short- to intermediate-term based on improved order rates and rising prices," Morrison said. He only recommends one stock, however, Inland, which is modernizing steelmaking operations to make them more efficient.     Despite his bearishness, Merrill's Bradford continues to recommend Armco, which he sees as a major turnaround.     Armco's steelmaking operations are profitable, the balance sheet has been improved, and its oilfield equipment business has been slimmed and put in a joint venture with USX, Bradford noted. "It's not a high-quality investment situation yet but they've come a long way," he said.     "We think the stock will do moderately better than the market," he said. Armco shares, trading off 1/4 at 10 today, could go to 12, and possibly as high as 15, he said.     Bradford sees Armco earning 50 to 75 cts a share in 1987, before special gains from recouped investment tax credits, against losses last year.     Armco's 1988 earnings could be significantly higher, he said.     Bradford is recommending sale of USX shares. "We had a buy on it below 20 but when it gets to 28, let somebody else have it," he said.     The steel and energy concern will earn about one dlr a share in 1987, about half of that coming from asset sales, and from two dlrs to 2.50 dlrs in 1988, Bradford said. "But a lot depends on oil prices," he added. About 60 pct of USX's sales come from oil and natural gas.     Other analysts, including Michelle Galanter Applebaum of Salomon Brothers Inc, recommend USX. "The company's done a lot (of restructuring), more than the market's given them credit for," she said.     She sees the stock going to the mid 30s or higher. USX was trading up 1/8 at 28-1/2. She predicts USX will earn 18 cts a share this year and 2.73 dlrs next year against large losses in 1986.     Applebaum, who is also positive on Armco and Inland, has been recommending the stocks since last November.     Peter Marcus of Painewebber Inc is neutral on the group although he said the earnings outlook is improved through the third quarter.     But he sees potential trouble beyond then. "I think (steel) prices on a bookings basis will start to drop by the summer," he said.     Applebaum of Salomon Brothers also sees some seasonal dropoff later in the year. "But there are more positives than negatives," she said, citing reduced capacity in the domestic industry, better prices, and a weaker dollar, which should cause steel imports to drop off slightly from last year.

19870409	TREASURY'S BAKER SAYS SYSTEM NEEDS STABILITY Treasury Secretary James Baker said the floating exchange rate system has not been as effective as had been hoped in promoting stability and preventing imbalances from emerging in the global economy.     In remarks before the afternoon session of the International Monetary Fund's Interim Committee, Baker said he was not suggesting that the system should be abandoned.     "But I do suggest," he said, "that we need something to give it more stability and to keep it headed in the right direction when the wind shifts."     He said that indicators can serve "as a kind of compass" but added that structural indicators can help focus attention on some policies.     Baker, however, said the IMF "needs to move beyond macroeconomic indicators and find structural indicators that can help focus attention on some of the policies of specific relevance to the imbalances we face today."     The Treasury Secretary said that indicators should be given a more prominent role in the annual economic reviews -- Article IV consultations -- that the Fund performs.     Baker also told the policy making group that it was time for the IMF to adopt earlier recommendations making IMF surveillance more relevant to national policymakers and the public.     "In particular, we urge increased publicity for IMF appraisals developed in Article IV consultations, the use of follow-up reports on country actions to implement IMF recommendations, and greater use of special consultation procedures," he said.     Baker emphasized that indicators were a device "for moving beyond rhetoric to action."     He said they provide "more structure to the system, and induce more discipline and peer pressure into the process of policy coordination."     He said the Fund's procedures for surveillance need to be reviewed and updated to reflect the use of indicators.     "This should be matter of priority for the executive board," he said.     Baker also urged the Fund to develop alternative medium-term economic scenarios for countries that "can help us focus even more clearly on the most important imbalances, by identifying options for addressing them and analyzing the implications of these options."     He said also that further work should be done on finding paths that lead toward possible medium-term objectives.     "If we are to take effective remedial action when there are significant deviations from an intended course, then we must have more definitive ways of indentifying the right course for key variables," he said.

19870409	U.K. POTATO FUTURES TRADING NOT TO BE SUSPENDED Trading on the London potato futures market will not be suspended, Richard Harris, Chairman of the London Potato Futures Association (LPFA), said in a statement to floor members.     It was in response to strong representations by the Potato Marketing Board (PMB) complaining of a gross distortion of price which they say will result in large deliveries into the physical market when the April futures position expires.     The PMB had sought an immediate suspension in futures trading and asked the LPFA to take action to restore the relationship between futures and physicals.     Farmers and merchants have alleged a squeeze and cornering of the market but Harris pointed out that recent investigations by the Association of Futures Brokers and Dealers (AFBD), the International Commodities Clearing House (ICCH) and other parties, found no evidence to substantiate this.     The main complaint from some sections of the physical market is what they say is an unrealistic futures premium over the PMB's average ex-farm price. April futures traded this morning between 168 and 170 stg per tonne compared with PMB's average price of 104 stg.     Bill Englebright, joint secretary of the LPFA said there is a two-tier market for physical potatoes. He said quality potatoes are in short supply and prepackers have been paying between 145 and 165 stg per tonne for best samples. But lesser quality grades have traded below 100 stg.     Some merchants fear that a large tonnage will be delivered against the April futures contract between now and the end of the month, and possibly disrupt the physical market.     Harris said the LPFA rule book allows the management committee to take steps as necessary to correct any malpractice and he assured the committee is monitoring the situation.  Reuter 3;
19870409	U.S. BANK DISCOUNT BORROWINGS 361 MLN DLRS U.S. bank discount window borrowings less extended credits averaged 361 mln dlrs a day in the week to Wednesday, April 8, the Federal Reserve said.     Total daily borrowings in the week fell 99 mln dlrs to 591 mln dlrs, with extended credits down 35 mln dlrs at 230 mln dlrs. The week was the second half of the two-week statement period that ended Wednesday. Net borrowings averaged 425 mln dlrs in the first week of the period.     Commenting on the two-week statement period that ended on April 8, the Fed said banks had average net free reserves of 447 mln dlrs.     A Fed spokesman told a press conference that there were no large one-day net misses in the Fed's estimates of reserves in the week ended Wednesday.     Of the week's borrowings, money center banks accounted for 65 pct, and small banks for almost 35 pct. On Wednesday, when net borrowings were 1.36 billion dlrs and Fed funds averaged a high 6.45 pct, money center banks accounted for more than 90 pct of the borrowing.     Borrowings in the latest two weeks averaged 393 mln dlrs a day, the highest since the statement period ended January 28.     Float ranged from about 250 mln dlrs on Thursday to between one and 1.25 billion dlrs on Monday and Tuesday.     The spokesman said Monday's float included 500 mln dlrs in holdover float at one Fed branch due to mechanical problems.     About 500 mln dlrs of Tuesday's float reflected non-weather-related transportation float in one Eastern Reserve bank.     As-of adjustments ranged from minus 500 mln dlrs on Monday, when cash letter errors at two eastern reserve banks were corrected, to plus 500 mln dlrs on Thursday, when a correction was made to unposted funds at a single bank.     In the first half of the statement period ended Wednesday, banks held excess reserves on the first four days of the week but ran a deficit on Wednesday.     In the second week, they ran a deficit on Thursday, Friday and Monday but held excess reserves on the final two days.  Reuter 3;
19870409	U.S. CONGRESSMAN INTRODUCES REAGAN SUGAR BILL Rep. John Porter, R-Ill., introduced in the House of Representatives legislation proposed by the Reagan administration to slash the U.S. sugar price support, a spokesman for Porter said.     The spokesman said the bill was introduced without any changes from the administration's proposal sent to Congress last month.     That plan calls for a cut in the sugar loan rate to 12 cents per pound from 18 cents now. Sugar growers would be compensated for the price cut with targeted direct payments, to be gradually phased-out through 1990. The payments to growers would cost an estimated 1.1 billion dlrs.     Representatives of sugar growers have rejected the proposal, saying it would ruin the domestic sugar industry.  Reuter 3;
19870409	U.S. DOLLAR LOSSES PROPEL BROAD COMMODITY GAINS Commodities from gold to grains to cotton posted solid gains in a flurry of buying today as losses in the U.S. dollar and rising interest rates kindled fears of inflation and economic instability.     Gains were most pronounced on the Commodity Exchange in New York, where gold jumped 12.40 dlrs and closed at 436.50 dlrs a troy ounce, and silver 22.5 cents to 6.86 dlrs a troy ounce.     A key factor behind the advance was anticipation that inflation will be the only way for the major industrial nations to halt the slide in the value of the U.S. dollar, said Steve Chronowitz, director of commodity research with Smith Barney, Harris Upham and Co., in New York.     The dollar tumbled one day after top finance officials from the seven largest industrial nations reaffirmed their commitment to support its value, and despite reports of intervention by the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank, traders said.     Traders said it appears that the industrial nations, known as the Group of Seven, lack the ability to change the long-term direction of the currency markets.     "Maybe they have some ideas or plans," said Chronowitz. "If they do, it's not evident."     "It looks like there's no cure but to let the free market take values to where they should be.     "One way or another, we will force our major trading partners to stimulate their economies," as a measure to correct the mounting U.S. trade deficit, Chronowitz said.     "I think the markets believe, and have believed for a long time, that the only recourse is to reflate at some point. It's going to be a long and tedious process, but that's what's happening," he said.     The falling value of the dollar makes U.S. commodities cheaper for foreign buyers, stimulating demand.     At the same time, traders who are holding stocks and bonds saw the value of their investments falling and many are turning to commodities such as precious metals as a hedge, said Marty McNeill, a metals analyst in New York with the trading house of Dominick and Dominick.     The reaction in the metal markets reverberated throughout the commodities markets, as grains, livestock, and cotton posted broad gains.     Traders at the Chicago Board of Trade said attention in the grain markets has shifted from concern about burdensome supplies to the outlook that a lower dollar will stimulate export demand.     After the close of trading, the Agriculture Department raised its estimate for grain imports by the Soviet Union by two mln tonnes from the month-earlier report.     Live hogs and frozen pork bellies posted sharp gains on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, while live cattle were moderately higher.     Analysts said several factors boosted hog prices. They said hogs haven't been making the weight gains that are normal at this time of year, and farmers have been too busy with field work to market animals.  Reuter 3;
19870409	U.S. ENERGY FUTURES CALLED UNCHANGED TO LOWER Traders expect U.S. energy futures will open unchanged to slightly lower this morning with support near yesterday's lows.     Crude futures are called unchanged to five cts weaker tracking unchanged domestic crudes and North Sea Brent crude, which traded at 18.01 dlrs a barrel today, about ten cts below yesterday's New York close.     Traders said the supply squeeze in 15-day forward April Brent appears to have ended.     Product futures, which fell sharply yesterday, are due to open unchanged to 0.25 cent lower, traders said.     Traders expect some followthrough selling in products but said gasoil futures in London will probably lend some support since they are trading as expected. May gasoil futures were off 1.50 dlrs a tonne this morning while June was down 1.25 dlrs in thin conditions.  Reuter 3;

19870409	U.S. MARCH RETAIL SALES CUT BY LATE EASTER U.S. retailers' lackluster March sales were due to a late Easter, according to analysts who expect a recovery in April.     "Sales look soft because of the Easter shift, but underlying business is better than the numbers indicate," said Bear Stearns analyst Monroe Greenstein.      Analysts generally average the sales results of March and April to account for the variation of Easter's occurance. This year, Easter is being observed on April 19, which is three weeks later than last year.     Analyst Edward Johnson of Johnson Redbook Associates said sales for March rose an unadjusted 2.5 to 3.0 pct, and a seasonally adjusted 5.5 pct to six pct, compared to an adjusted 5.7 pct last year.     "The obvious question is whether these numbers indicate that the consumer activity is slowing, but it does not appear to be because liquidity and employment are rising," said analyst Jeff Edelman, analyst of Drexel Lambert and Burnham.     Overall, analysts said first half sales are coming in according to expectations. Sales for all of 1987 are expected to rise about 5.5 pct to six pct, up a bit from 1986's rise.      In March, sales of housewares, furniture and big ticket items were stronger than apparel sales, signaling to many analysts that apparel sales will be strong in April as the holiday nears.     "Sales gains in home appliances and home fashions reflect a continuing strength in the housing market," said Edward Brennan, chairman of Sears Roebuck and Co <S> which reported an overall sales gain of 4.2 pct. Brennan said sales of women's sportswear were also excellent.     "Sears' total apparel sales was up only modestly, but even a modest improvement in apparel is a very good accomplishment due to the fact that most people will buy apparel in April," said C.J. Lawrence analysts Harry Mortner.      J.C. Penney Co Inc <JCP> and Dayton Hudson Corp <DH> were among the weaker performers with comparable stores sales declining 1.5 pct and 4.9 pct, respectively. Penney's store and catalog sales declined 1.3 pct overall and Dayton Hudson's overall sales rose 4.8 pct.     Penney chairman William Howell said, "Sales continued strong for catalog operations and, geographically, ranged from very active in the east to weak in the economically depressed southwest."     "Penney's been shifting away from leisure time activity wear to other apparel lines, which yield higher profit margins, but are currently hurting sales," said Greenstein of Bear Stearns.     Hudson chairman Kenneth Mackes cited the late Easter for the decline. Edelman of Drexel said that "Hudson had a tougher comparison because it had an exceptionally good 1986."     Most analysts agreed that promotions are slightly lower than last year.     "Retailers are not planning for much - inventories are being kept lean, markdowns are lower than last year, but sales are coming through anyway," said CJ Analyst Harry Mortner.     Mortner said he expects profits in the first quarter to   be better than he had originally expected in the beginning of the year.     Most retailers report their first quarter in the middle of May.

19870409	U.S. MARKETS OFFER GLIMPSE OF VOLCKER NIGHTMARE Today's turmoil in the U.S. Financial markets, with bond and stock prices tumbling in the dollar's wake, is evidence of a major shift in investor psychology that is likely to spell more turbulence ahead, economists said.     For two years, the markets had hailed the dollar's decline as the cure-all for the U.S. Trade deficit. Interest rates fell sharply and Wall Street became a one-way street, up.     But that confidence is now cracking as the financial markets suddenly believe Fed chairman Paul Volcker's often-repeated warnings about the risks of a dollar collapse.     "Volcker's been saying for a long time that a dollar freefall would be extremely dangerous - now he's got it," said David Jones, economist at Aubrey G. Lanston and Co Inc.     The dollar fell below 144 yen today for the first time in 40 years as the Group of Seven finance ministers in Washington failed to convince the foreign exchange market that they have a credible strategy for redressing global trade imbalances, short of further depreciation of the dollar.     Bonds suffered their biggest one-day drop in months amid worries that the dollar's slide will rekindle inflation, scare away foreign investors and force the Fed to tighten credit.     The inflationary fears boosted gold bullion by more than 12 dlrs to a 1987 high of 432.20/70 dlrs an ounce, while the spike in interest rates pulled the Dow Jones Industrial Average down by 33 points to 2339.     Norman Robertson, Mellon Bank chief economist, called the markets' instability frightening. He believes economic fundamentals do not justify the bearishness but said that "once you start the ball rolling it's difficult to stop."     "There's a stark possibility that you could get a destabilizing drop in the dollar that forces up interest rates and drives us into recession. The markets are in a panic."     Stephen Marris of the Institute for International Economics in Washington, has been warning for a long time that the controlled decline of the dollar since peaks of 3.47 marks and 264 yen in February 1985 could turn into a nightmare.     "We're still more or less on track for a hard landing... But the agony may be fairly drawn out," Marris told Reuters.     Marris does not expect the crisis to peak until later this year, but he warned that the situation is so fragile that it would take very little to touch off what he calls the second phase of the hard landing, whereby a loss of confidence in the dollar pushes up interest rates and leads to a recession.     The stock market's reaction today and its sharp drop on March 30 shows how the loss of confidence could come about.     The fact that it has not happened yet is consistent with historical experience, which teaches that domestic markets are not affected until a currency is in the final stages of its decline, Marris said. He has forecast a drop to about 125 yen.     Marris felt that a major impetus for the dollar's latest weakness was the loss of credibility that central banks suffered when they failed to prevent the dollar from falling below 150 yen, the floor that the market believes was set as part of the G-7 Paris agreement in February.     Robertson at Mellon, by contrast, said the loss of confidence was triggered last week when Washington announced plans to slap 300 mln dlrs of tariffs on Japanese electronic imports, raising the specter of a debilitating trade war.     Many economists believe that long-run stability will not return to the markets until the root cause of the trade gap is addressed - excessive consumption in the U.S., Reflected in the massive budget deficit.     But in the short term, given the failure of the G-7 and of central bank intervention, some feel that the Fed will have no choice but to tighten credit to restore faith in the dollar.     "The only thing that will stop the dollar falling is a substantial increase in the discount rate and a corresponding cut abroad, at least by Japan," said Lanston's Jones.     Marris expects the Fed to act quickly to raise interest rates, even at the risk of increasing the debt burden for American farmers, Latin American governments and others.     But Robert Giordano, chief economist at Goldman Sachs and Co, scoffed at the notion. "It's ridiculous to think the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates when the dollar is weak against just one currency. This is yen strength, not dollar weakness," he said.     Giordano said the market was ignoring the progress being made toward reducing the U.S. Budget deficit.     "We're going to have one of the biggest reductions in the budget deficit relative to GNP in history this year, and nobody cares," he said, noting that only the deficit cut in 1968-69 will have been greater.     He said he does not expect the dollar to collapse and thinks interest rates are likely to fall back later this year.     But for now, market psychology has changed so abruptly that a further drop in the bond market cannot be ruled out. "Put on your helmets," Giordano said.  REUTER 3;
19870409	U.S. OIL DEPENDENCY SEEN RISING TO RECORD LEVEL The United States' dependency on foreign oil sources may reach record levels by the mid-1990s, according to John H. Lichtblau, president of Petroleum Industry Research Associates.     Lichtblau, speaking at an alternative energy conference here, said the U.S. may depend on foreign suppliers for as much as 52 pct of its oil by 1995, surpasssing the previous high level of 47 pct in 1977.     "The long term growth in dependency on foreign oil is inevitable," Lichtblau said. As much as 30 pct of U.S. oil imports in 1995 could come from OPEC nations, he said.     Lichtblau said the U.S. depended on foreign suppliers for 33 pct of its oil in 1986 and predicted that would increase to 40 pct by 1990.     "However, the rate of this growth can be affected positively or negatively through government action or inaction," Lichtblau said.     He said that one of the government's negative actions is the maintenance of the windfall profits tax which acts as a disincentive to developing existing fields and reduces cash flow for oil exploration.     Lichtblau called for the adoption of an international floor price for crude oil to help stabilize world oil prices.     "An international floor price adopted by all or most industrial countries would clearly be a much more effective measure and would be much less distortive for the U.S. than if we imposed it alone," Lichtblau said.     Development of alternate energy sources such as synthetic fuels as well as increased development in Alaska could lessen U.S. dependency on foreign oil, Lichtblau said.     A potential for alternative supplies could limit the willingness of OPEC nations to raise oil prices, he said.     Lichtblau also called for the federal government to offer tax abatements for oil drilling, to fill the Strategic Petroleum Reserve at a faster rate and to develop pilot plans for alternative energy.

19870409	U.S. ONE-YEAR BILL YIELDS RATE OF 5.92 PCT The U.S. Treasury said its auction of 9.76 billion dlrs of 52-week bills produced an average rate of 5.92 pct.     The rate was up from 5.68 pct at the last auction of one-year bills on March 12.     At today's sale, the bond-equivalent yield was 6.30 pct.  Accepted bids ranged from 5.88 pct to 5.93 pct and 80 pct of bids at the high, or stopout, rate were taken.

19870409	U.S. SAID TO VIEW G-7 MEETING AS MAJOR SUCCESS The United States, which has long sought Japanese action to stimulate its economy, appears to be satisfied Tokyo's latest package is a major development and allows leading industrial nations to reaffirm their agreement to stabilize currencies.     Monetary sources said they believed that U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker considered Tokyo's package, announced yesterday, to be a major stimulation of the Japanese economy.     But yesterday's statement by seven leading industrial powers endorses the yen's rise from around 153 to the dollar, the level at the February 22 Paris Accord, to about 145 today.     And the initial reaction of currency markets in the Far East demonstrates that financial markets are unconvinced that currencies yet reflect economic fundamentals, even though the countries appear to do so. The yen sank below 145 at one point despite intervention by the Bank of Japan.     Kiichi Miyazawa, Japan's Finance Minister, said the movement since Paris was consistent with currency trading ranges the nations agreed to defend in the February talks.     "I would say that what has happened (to the yen) in the past several weeks was not outside the range we agreed to in the discussions in Paris," Miyazawa said yesterday.     The supplementary budget worth about 34.48 billion dlrs was announced by the ruling Liberal Democratic Party on the eve of Miyazawa's departure for Washington, to attend yesterday's meetings of leading industrial nations.     In a strongly worded statement terming the Japanese action "extraordinary and urgent", the meeting reaffirmed the Paris Accord by noting that current exchange rates are within ranges broadly consistent with fundamentals, or economic reality.     The Group of Seven -- the United States, Japan, West Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada -- therefore repeated their willingness to continue close cooperation to foster exchange rate stability.     The cooperation agreement has resulted in concerted central bank intervention of 8 billion to 9 billion dlrs to halt the dollar's fall. While relatively unsuccessful, the scale of intervention between so many nations is unprecedented in recent years. Monetary sources also said they understood that Secretary Baker considered the meeting to be extremely successful in the light of the Japanese announcement.     They also said there was a growing feeling among the finance ministers and central bankers that cooperation over medium-term policies has replaced the bickering over short-term differences in past meetings.     West Germany, whose currency has not risen anything like the yen since the Paris Agreement, appears from the face of yesterday's statement to have won acceptance from other countries that its exchange rate is acceptable.     Bonn's finance minister Gerhard Stoltenberg argues that major currency shifts needed to remedy the huge imbalance between West Germany and Japan's trade surpluses and America's trade deficit have already taken place.     No mention was made, however, of the U.S. commitment to cut the budget deficit even though it is implied in the reafffirmation of Paris.     European nations and Japan believe deficit cuts are essential to curbing the record U.S. trade shortfall that reached nearly 170 billion dlrs last year.     A similar argument was made on Capitol Hill earlier this week by Federal Reserve Board chairman Paul Volcker. A further sharp fall to redress trade imbalances would "clearly pose substantial risks of renewed inflationary momentum and could undermine confidence in future financial stability," he said.     Volcker warned a further dollar fall might force the politically independent Fed to drive up interest rates.     Monetary sources said that, privately, West Germany welcomed the rise in the yen against the dollar while its own currency remained relatively stable against the U.S. unit.     Bonn and other European nations worry that once the weak dollar blunts Tokyo's export drive to the United States, the Japanese monolith will concentrate on European markets.     The ministers, meanwhile, also continued talks on making their policy coordination more binding and one, Canadian Finance Minister Michael Wilson, said good progress was made.     Wilson said they will meet before the June Economic Summit to prepare a report for the leaders of the seven nations.     The United States and France, backed by the International Monetary Fund, want the seven to agree on ranges or "norms" for a limited number of economic objectives such as growth, inflation, monetary conditions, trade balances and current account balances.     Sharp deviations from these guidelines would result in consultations between the countries on whether corrective action should be required.     But the inclusion of currencies as one of the objectives has Bonn and London worried, monetary sources say, because it implies Washington is moving in the direction of target zones.     The sources said the Reagan administration unsuccessfully sounded out its allies on a system of target zones to limit currency fluctuations just before the February meeting.     The concept is a much more rigid one than the secret ranges of the Paris Accord and would mark a sharp departure from the relatively free currency markets of recent years.  Reuter 3;
19870409	U.S. TREASURY'S BAKER SAYS RATE SHIFTS ORDERLY Treasury Secretary James Baker said that changes in exchange rates have generally been orderly and have improved the prospects for a reduction in external imbalances to more sustainable levels.     In remarks before the IMF's policy-making Interim Committee, Baker reiterated a Group of Seven statement last night that the substantial exchange rate changes since the Plaza agreement 18 months ago have "now brought currencies within ranges broadly consistent with economic fundamentals."     Baker said, "These exchange rate shifts have generally been orderly, and have improved prospects for the reduction of external imbalances to more sustainable levels."     As they are today, the trade and current account imbalances "simply are not sustainable," Baker told the ministers.     He said that the Reagan administration was resisting "strong domestic pressure" for trade protection and was working closely with the U.S. Congress in crafting a trade bill.     "While we cannot yet be sure of the outcome, we are doing what we can to ensure that the bill is not protectionist," he said.     Baker also urged the International Monetary Fund's executive board to review possible modifications to the Fund's compensatory financing facility before the annual meeting this fall.     "We should pay particular attention to the lack of continuing conditionality associated with the use of the CFF and to whether shortfalls in export earnings are indeed temporary," he said.  Reuter 3;

In comments on its latest Export Sales Report, the department said Iraq, Japan and the USSR were the largest buyers.     Sales for the next marketing year, which begins September 1, totaled 503,200 tonnes and were mainly to Iraq and Taiwan.     Wheat sales of 119,300 tonnes for the current season and net reductions of 13,700 tonnes for the 1987/88 season were four-fifths below the combined total for the prior week and the four-week average, it said.     Sri Lanka was the most active wheat destination with purchases of 52,500 tonnes for the current year, it said.     Other significant purchasers for the current year were Mexico and Honduras, it said.     Soybean sales of 240,500 tonnes were one-fifth below the prior week and nearly one-third below the four-week average.     Japan, Mexico, South Korea, Italy and Israel were the major purchasers, the department said.     Net sales of 117,700 tonnes of soybean cake and meal fell 31 pct from the previous week and 38 pct below the four-week average. Major increases for West Germany, Venezuela, the Netherlands and Saudi Arabia were partially offset by reductions for unknown destinations, USDA said.     Activity in soybean oil resulted in decreases of 2,400 tonnes, with sales to unknown destinations down by 2,700 tonnes, while sales to Canada increased 200 tonnes, the Department said.     Combined sales of 71,300 running bales of cotton -- 60,200 bales for the current season and 11,100 bales for 1987/88 season -- were four-fifths higher than the prior week's level but nine pct below the four-week average.     Mexico was the dominant buyer for the current year followed by Zaire, Italy, and Spain, the department said. The primary buyers for the 1987/88 season were South Korea, Spain, Japan and Taiwan, the department said.

(Note: Company has said profit will match 1985 level, despite provisions of 480 mln marks connected with alleged currency fraud.

19870409	VW SAYS 480 MLN MARKS MAXIMUM FOR CURRENCY LOSSES Losses for Volkswagen AG <VOWG.F>, VW, linked to an alleged foreign currency fraud will not exceed the 480 mln marks provision already made, a VW spokesman said.     The spokesman was commenting after VW had confirmed it would pay an unchanged 10 mark dividend for ordinary shares on 1986 business, despite the provision.     One West German newspaper today quoted foreign currency dealers in Frankfurt as speculating that the total losses from the currency affair could be as high as 1.5 billion marks, but the VW spokesman described 480 mln marks as an "upper limit."     VW said in a statement following today's supervisory board meeting that it had discussed the foreign currency scandal in detail, and was setting up a new probe into its foreign currency activities to be carried out by an unnamed auditing company.     VW has said computer programs were erased and documents were faked in the alleged fraud in which it believes transactions intended to protect it against possible foreign currency losses were not completed.     VW's former foreign currency chief Burkhard Junger was arrested on Monday on suspicion of embezzlement and of having evaded justice.     Earlier VW had said that its 1986 results would match 1985 profits. VW's group net profit in 1985 was 596 mln marks and parent company net was 477 mln marks. It also said it recommend an unchanged dividend to the supervisory board. The company has also set a dividend of 11 marks for new preference shares, which were issued last year. Analysts have described the held dividend as a move to reassure worried shareholders.     VW increased nominal capital by 300 marks last year to 1.5 billion marks, with the result that its total dividend payment on 1986 will be 306 mln marks compared with 240 mln on 1985, since the new capital was in preference shares.     The share analysts say VW will have to dig into reserves in order to maintain the disclosed 1986 profit at 1985 levels. At the end of 1985, VW had parent company reserves of slightly less than three billion marks.  REUTER 3;

19870409	YEN SEEN RISING AFTER G-7 COMMUNIQUE The yen is likely to start another uneven rise against the dollar and other major currencies because the Group of Seven communique contained nothing new, currency and bond analysts here said.     "Is that it? I was expecting something more than that," said one trader at a major Wall Street securities company.     Marc Cohen of Republic National Bank of New York said: "The market now has the impetus to drive the dollar lower again."     The dollar hovered between 145.50 and 147 yen in the days just before the talks. Dealers restrained their underlying bearishness and squared positions ahead of Wednesday's meeting of the finance ministers and central bankers of the top seven industrialized nations in Washington.     After more than four hours of talks, the G-7 issued a communique which merely reaffirmed the recent Paris agreement's view that prevailing currency levels were broadly consistent with economic fundamentals and that exchange rate stability should be fostered around these levels.     The dollar sank to 144.75 yen in early Tokyo trading.     "They said that the dollar/yen rate was broadly in line with fundamentals when it was 154. Now they are saying it's in line when it's at 146. Will this still be so at 138 or 130?," asked Republic's Cohen.     Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa fuelled speculation about the amount of fluctuation the authorities are prepared to tolerate by saying that the current yen level is still inside the range agreed on in Paris in late February.     Official statements in recent weeks had indicated that the key psychological level of 150 yen was at the lower end of the authorities' permissible range.     Dealers and analysts warned that the dollar's decline would probably be uneven. They anticipated a concerted effort to prop up the dollar and restrain the yen via a mixture of open market intervention and public comments.     Shortly after the Tokyo market opened today the Bank of Japan was detected by local dealers buying moderate amounts of dollars. The dollar rebounded to about 145.20 yen.     The sources said the market may also be wary of agressively selling dollars for yen before Tuesday's February U.S. Trade data. The figures are expected to show a deficit of 13 billion dlrs, from a provisional 14.8 billion in January.     3;

The report, dated April 7, said the wheat must be from 1986 and 1987 harvest, and imports of soft wheat from Europe and from other suppliers will not be considered.     It said the imports will be used to rebuild the federal reserves and as a result will not be subject to import surcharges.  Reuter 3;
19870411	BRITISH MINISTER SAYS HE WARNED TOKYO OF SANCTIONS A British minister said he had given the Japanese government a clear warning of sanctions against Japanese companies if Tokyo did not allow more access to its internal markets "and it was clearly understood."     Corporate Affairs Minister Michael Howard said on his return from a visit to Japan he thought the Japanese were beginning to appreciate the need to be "fair and open" about access to their own markets.     At an airport news conference Howard denied opposition charges that his trip had been a failure because he had returned empty-handed.     "I did what I set out to do. I was sent to deliver a clear message to the Japanese government, and I delivered it very clearly, and it has been clearly understood."     Howard said that under the Financial Services Act the govenment had considerable flexibility in taking sanctions against Japanese companies and finance houses operating in Britain.     "It is not simply a question of withdrawing or refusing operating licences. We can ban firms from certain countries from carrying out certain kinds of business, while allowing them to carry out other kinds."     "I hope we don't have to use these powers, but I made it clear in Japan that if our timetable isn't met, we shall use them."     He said it would be unfortunate if Britain and Japan became involved in a tit-for-tat exchange, adding that Japan gained more than anyone else from an open trading relationship.     "I think they are beginning to appreciate that if this relationship is to continue, it is very important for them to be fair and open about access to their own markets."     On the question of the British firm Cable and Wireless Plc <CAWL.L>, which is trying to win a significant share of telecommunications contracts in Japan, Howard said he had told the Japanese this was being widely regarded as a test case.     He said there were signs of movement on the case. Cable and Wireless was due to take part in talks in Japan next Tuesday, he said.     Earlier this week British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said Britain could not go it alone on sanctions against Japan, but would have to coordinate action with its European Community partners.     Community sources said after a meeting of trade officials yesterday that the group might impose steep new tariffs on a range of Japanese goods to prevent diversion from United States markets if Washington imposes trade sanctions against Tokyo as it has threatened.

19870411	DRY SPELL IN PHILIPPINES DAMAGES AGRICULTURE CROPS A prolonged dry spell has damaged 111,350 hectares of rice and corn plantations in 10 provinces in the central and southern Philippines, agriculture officials said.     They said some 71,070 tonnes of agricultural produce estimated at about 250 mln pesos was lost to the lack of rainfall. They warned of a severe drought if the prevailing conditions continued until next month.     Agriculture Secretary Carlos Dominguez said he hoped the losses would be offset by the expected increase in output in other, normally more productive areas not affected by the dry spell.     Affected were 14,030 hectares of palay (unmilled rice), representing a production loss of 22,250 tonnes valued at 77.8 mln pesos, Department of Agriculture reports said.     About 48,820 tonnes of corn from 97,320 hectares valued at 170.8 mln pesos have also been lost, they said.     Officials said the hectarage planted to palay that has been hit by the drought accounted for only one pct of national total thus the damage is considered negligible.     In the case of corn, they said the loss can be filled by production from non-traditional corn farms which diversified into the cash crop from sugar two years ago.      The Philippine Coconut Authority said coconut production in the major producing region of Bicol might drop by 25 pct to 320,000 tonnes if the dry spell continued. There were no reports of actual damage.  REUTER 3;
19870411	JAPAN WARNS U.S. IT MAY RETALIATE IN TRADE DISPUTE Japan warned the United States it may take retaliatory measures if the United States imposes its planned trade sanctions on April 17, a senior government official said.     Shinji Fukukawa, Vice Minister of the International Trade and Industry Ministry, said in a statement Japan would consider measures under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and other actions if the United States imposes 100 pct tariffs on some Japanese exports as planned next week.     However, Fukukawa said Japan was ready to continue trade talks with the United States despite its failure to convince America to call off the threatened tariffs during two days of emergency talks which ended in Washington yesterday.     Last month President Reagan announced the sanctions in retaliation for what he called Japan's failure to honour a July 1986 agreement to stop dumping computer microchips in markets outside the United States and to open its home market to American goods.     Fukukawa said the United States had regrettably not listened to Japan's explanation of its efforts to live up the pact and said Washington had not given any detailed explanation of why it planned to impose the tariffs.

19870411	SMUGGLING BLAMED FOR CLOSURE OF HAITIAN SUGAR FIRM A sugar mill which was this nation's second largest employer closed its doors yesterday, saying it had been run out of business by sugar smuggled from Miami and the neighbouring Dominican Republic.     The closure of the Haitian American Sugar Company (HASCO) will idle 3,500 employees and affect as many as 30,000 to 40,000 small sugar cane planters in regions around the capital, the company said.     "Because of unprecedented and ever-growing smuggling, HASCO regrets ... It cannot continue to accept delivery of sugar cane after April 10," the mill warned planters earlier this week.     Since President Jean-Claude Duvalier fled Haiti fourteen months ago, widescale smuggling of basic goods such as cooking oil, flour, rice, sugar and canned milk has lowered consumer prices but bankrupted several local manufacturers, throwing hundreds of thousands of Haitians out of work.     At the HASCO compound, where grim-faced workers lined up to receive their last pay, Spokesman Georges D. Rigaud showed a warehouse stocked with an estimated 445,000 unsold 100-pound (45-kg) bags of sugar.     "We are closing because of our huge stock of unsold sugar. We have no money left to continue operations," Rigaud said.     He said the company owed 7.6 mln dlrs and had borrowed an additional 1.5 mln dlrs in order to pay off workers.     Rigaud blamed the mill's problems on an order by Duvalier two years ago forbidding HASCO from refining sugar.     He said the government then began importing refined sugar at world market prices and reselling it at a huge profit and the provisional military-civilian government that replaced Duvalier last year continued the policy.     "But now with all the smuggling even the state can't compete with smuggled Dominican refined sugar," Rigaud said.     HASCO workers earned 4.20 dlrs daily, considerably above the usual minimum wage of three dlrs.     It is generally estimated that every employed Haitian supports at least six people. Rigaud said HASCO's closing at a minimum would affect 280,000 to 300,000 people.     Laid-off workers were bitter about the closure. "We're dead, and it's the government that's causing us to die," declared Lucien Felix, 34, who has five dependents.  REUTER 3;

19870411	TAIWAN ANNOUNCES NEW ROUND OF IMPORT TARIFF CUTS Taiwan announced plans for another round of import tariff cuts on 862 foreign goods shortly before trade talks with Washington which officials described as a move to help balance trade with the United States.     Wang Der-Hwa, Deputy Director of the Finance Ministry's Customs Administration Department, told reporters the list of products included 60 items asked by Washington.     "The move is part of our government efforts to encourage imports from our trading partners, particularly from the United States," he said.     He said the ministry sent a proposal today to the cabinet that the tariffs on such products as cosmetics, bicycles, apples, radios, garments, soybeans and television sets be cut by between five and 50 pct.     The cabinet was expected to give its approval next Thursday and the new tariff cuts would be implemented possibly starting on April 20, he added.     Taiwan introduced a sweeping tariff cut on some 1,700 foreign products last January aimed at helping reduce its growing trade surplus with the United States, the island's largest trading partner.     Washington however was not satisfied with the cuts and pressed for more reductions as a way of cutting its huge trade deficit with Taipei.     Washington's deficit with Taipei rose to a record 13.6 billion U.S. Dlrs last year from 10.2 billion in 1985. It widened to 3.61 billion in the first quarter of 1987 from 2.78 billion a year earlier, Taiwan's official figures show.     Today's announcement came before a departure later today of a 15-member Taiwan delegation for Washington for a series of trade talks with U.S. Officials.     The delegation's leader, Vincent Siew, told reporters last night he was leaving with "a heavy heart," meaning that he would face tough talks in Washington because of rising protectionist sentiments in the U.S. Congress. Taiwan's 1986 trade surplus with Washington was the third largest, after Japan and Canada.     Siew said the talks, starting on April 14, would cover U.S. Calls for Taiwan to open its market to American products, purchases of major U.S. Machinery and power plant equipment, import tariff cuts and protection of intellectual property.     "I am afraid this time we have to give more than take from our talks with the U.S.," he said without elaborating.  REUTER 3;
19870411	UGANDA PULLS OUT OF COFFEE MARKET - TRADE SOURCES Uganda's Coffee Marketing Board (CMB) has stopped offering coffee on the international market because it is unhappy with current prices, coffee trade sources said.     The board suspended offerings last week but because of its urgent need for cash it was not immediately clear how long it could sustain, the sources added.     Hundreds of Ugandan coffee farmers and processors have been waiting several months for payment from the CMB, which has had trouble finding enough railway wagons to move the coffee to the Kenyan port of Mombasa.     Foreign banks have contributed to the cash crisis by holding up remittance of Uganda's hard currency earnings from coffee exports, the government newspaper New Vision said.     The banks are holding up to seven mln dlrs in coffee money and President Yoweri Museveni is thinking of imposing a penalty for such delays, it added.     Banking sources said a third factor in the crisis was that commercial banks have lent the board only 77 billion shillings -- the equivalent of 55 mln dlrs -- for crop finance in the current coffee year, while the government had asked for 100 billion.     The CMB has 455,000 60-kg bags of coffee, about 15 pct of annual production, stockpiled in Kampala awaiting shipment.     The crop accounts for over 90 pct of Uganda's export earnings and the recent slide in prices to four-year lows is likely to more than offset an expected increase in production.     CMB officials have forecast that because the government has restored law and order in important growing areas, Uganda will produce over three mln bags of coffee in the year ending September 30, about 25 pct more than in 1985/6.

19870413	BANK OF ENGLAND TO MONITOR WHEN-ISSUED TRADING The Bank of England will step up reporting requirements for primary dealers in U.K. Government gilts during the when-issued trading period in between the date an auction is announced and the date the sale is actually held.     In its document on the auctions, the Bank said "The Bank is content for such (when-issued) trading to cevelop subject to certain conditions, in particular for predential supervision of the credit risk to which the gilt-edged market makers and Inter-dealer brokers may become exposed."     The Bank is widely expected to require dealers to report wehn-issued trading positions on a daily basis.     When-issued trading presents certain unusual risks because dealers are buying and selling a security that technically does not exist although there is no uncertainty about when it will be issued.     Still, the fact there is no physical delivery possible presents certain credit risks as well.     The Bank is widely expected to expand its reporting requiremenmts for unsettled trades, requiring firms to report unsettled when-issued trades one day after they occur. Normally, unsettled trades must be reported three days after they occur.  REUTER 3;

19870413	PRIMARY GILTS DEALERS NEED NOT BUY AT AUCTIONS Primary dealers in U.K. Government gilts will not be required to underwrite the government's offering of its securities when the first auctions begin in Mid-May, the Bank of England said.     In an official notice released today, the Bank said "There will be no formal or informal underwriting arrangement for the auctions but the Bank encourages all gilt-edged market makers, as part of their commitment to the market, to participate actively in the auction process."     The Bank was originally believed to have favoured requiring the dealers to underwrite auctions, which are patterned after those in the U.S. Treasury market.     However, the Treasury was believed to have baulked at the request by the 27 market makers for an allotment commission which would discourage the largest institutional investors from placing orders for new stock directly through the Bank of England, thus denying primary dealers some of their best customers. Commission would have been passed along to customers who did place orders via the primary dealers, making it less expensive to buy through them than to go directly to the Bank.     Market sources said the Bank had, in its discussions with the dealers about the upcoming auctions, agreed that the allotment commission was reasonable if the dealers had a concurrent commitment to buy at the auction regardless of market conditions.     Indeed, the Bank and the gilts dealers are believed to be disappointed that the Treasury has not agreed to go along with the plan. However, in its paper, the Bank suggested that any conditions applied for the first few auctions may be abandoned or modified in future sales of gilts if they prove inefficient or unwieldy.     Among other items in the document, the Bank said its first auction will consist of up to 1.25 billion stg in conventional short-dated stock and have a maturity of seven years or less.     Subsequent auctions to be held in the 1987-88 financial year would first be of up to one billion stg of long-dated stock having a maturity of 15 years or longer and then of up to one billion stg of medium dated stock of seven to 15 years in maturity.     The remainder of the gilt-edged funding program would be met by traditional tap offerings of stock via the government broker.     To protect the buyers of the newly auctioned stock, the Bank has agreed to establish a so-called fallow period, a 28-day period during which it agrees not to issue any new stock of the same type, and it will not necessarily resume selling the stock once the fallow period expires.     In the event that prices offered for the stock to be sold are substantially out of line with market conditions, the Bank will agree to take the stock onto its own books.     The bank would then be free to sell the stock during the fallow period but not at a price below the minimum tender price.     The Bank also said that at least initially, auctions will be alloted on a bid price basis, a system under which bidders are allotted stock at the price which they bid.     However, the Bank said it reserves the right to limit any money market maker from buying more than 25 pct of a single auction. The Bank is widely believed to be concerned about preventing a single market maker from cornering a stock to drive the price up.    The Bank has repeatedly signalled its intention to prevent dealers from cornering the market in a stock, issuing additional stock, on occasion, to end a market shortage.     The Bank has also agreed to publish information about the auction results as soon as possible after the sale is complete, which is widely expected to be on the same day.     Information to be released will include the amount of stock allotted in terms of both competitive and non-competitive bids, and the highest, lowest and average price of the successful bids.

Bilzerian told Reuters he believes his offer is superior to a leveraged buyout proposal disclosed in an announcement by the company this morning.     The company said it is evaluating both proposals. Bilizerian said he was optimistic his offer will be accepted at a meeting of the board of directors Wednesday. Officials of Pay N' Pak did were not immediately available for comment.       Bilzerian said he has a pool of 150 mln dlrs raised by Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc available for the tender and "we may add a bank to that."     "We've submitted an agreement we're prepared to sign," he said. Shares not accepted in Bilzerian's tender would be exchangeable for 20 dlrs in convertible preferred stock.     Asked what would happen if the leveraged buyout group, which the company did not identify, topped his offer between now and the board meeting, Bilzerian said he expected an opportunity to respond.     Pay N' Pak gave no details about the buyout group, but did say the offer was contingent on financing and on an agrreement regarding management's equity participation.     Bilzerian said it was his understanding that the management particpation was "nominal."     Pay N' Pak fell 1-1/2 to 19. Arbitrageurs said there was disappointment that neither of the offers topped 20 dlrs.     "We were expecting an offer north of (above) 21 or 22 dlrs," said one arbitrageur. The leveraged buyout plan was for 17.50 dlrs per share in cash and 2.50 dlrs in 13-1/2 pct cumulative preferred stock.      Robert Cheadle, analyst at Montgomery Securities, said "you have to ask yourself why no one in the industry made a bid."     Scott Drysdale, analyst at Birr Wilson Securities, said the company has not made the best strategic moves over the years. "They have not done the right things at the right time," he said, and as a result earnings per share have steadily declined since 1984. The 57 cts per share in earnings reported for the fiscal year ended in February was lower than 1978's earnings, he said. Earnings totaled 5.7 mln dlrs on revenue of 398.4 mln dlrs.     Drysdale said Pay N' Pak has better trained sales people than many competitors, but it competes on price even though competitors have lower costs. The result is squeezed margins. He noted that there have been no other publicly identified bidders stepping forward since the company rejected an earlier Bilzerian proposal in mid-April.     Another arbitrageur said it might not be too late for another bidder to get in the game. He speculated that someone in the same home improvement business might be able to offer a deal for stock that would top both the buyout proposal and Bilzerian's plan.  Reuter 3;

If at least 90 pct of the shares are not tendered, the offer will be prorated to 49 pct, the companies said.     ARGOSystems has granted Boeing an option to buy 1,238,311 shares or 18.5 pct of the outstanding stock for 37 dlrs a share, they said.     Also, Bill May, chairman of ARGOSystems, and three other officers have granted Boeing an option to buy their shares, another 8.9 pct of the outstanding stock, for 37 dlrs a share.     ARGOSystems makes equipment to monitor and analyze military communications signals, electronic warfare equipment to monitor and jam radar signals and signal processing systems.     For the nine months ended March 31, 1987, ARGOSystems reported earnings more than doubled to 6.3 mln dlrs or 95 cts a share from 3.1 mln dlrs or 46 cts. The year-ago period included a 2.2 mln dlr charge from a writedown of securities. Sales rose 23.5 pct to 70.9 mln dlrs.     Sales are expected to exceed 100 mln dlrs for the fiscal year ending June 30, the companies said in a joint statement.     The company's backlog is currently more than 180 mln dlrs, they said. It has about 1,200 employees.     About 30 pct of ARGOSystems' business comes from international customers.     "ARGOSystems is a clear leader in its field. This association will expand our overall activities and significantly enhance our ability to compete in the defense electronics area," Boeing president Frank Shrontz said in a statement.     ARGOSystems will operate as a wholly owned subsidiary of Boeing Co.     The merger following the tender offer will be subject to approval by ARGOSystems shareholders, the companies said.     The tender offer and merger are subject to customary conditions and expiration of the Hart-Scott-Rodino notification waiting period, they said.  Reuter 3;
19870601	BORDEN <BN> TO ACQUIRE MAJOR PASTA MAKER Borden Inc said it is acquiring <Prince Co Inc> and three companies producing grocery products for 180 mln dlrs.     Borden said the four companies are expected to have 1987 sales totaling 230 mln dlrs.     It said Prince, a Lowell, Mass., producer of pasta and Italian food sauces, is expected to account for 210 mln dlrs of this total. This year's sales of Borden pasta -- by the 13 regional brands and the premium Creamette brand distributed on a nearly national basis -- are expected to toal 285 mln dlrs, it said.     Borden said the other three companies being acquired are Steero Bouillon of Jersey City, N.J., Blue Channel Inc, a Beaufort, S.C., producer of canned crabmeat, and the canned shrimp products line of DeJean Packing Inc of Biloxi, Miss.     Borden also said the divestment of three operations with about 50 mln dlrs a year in sales is expected to produce nearly 45 mln dlrs in cash for use toward the purchase of new businesses.     It said the sale of Polyco of Cincinnati, Ohio, which makes polyvinyl acetate emulsions, to Rohm and Haas Co <ROH> was announced by the buyer last month.         Borden said the divestment of two producers of toy models and hobby items -- Heller in France and Humbrol in England -- is in process.  Reuter 3;
19870601	BRAZIL NOT SELLING TO COCOA BUFFER STOCK - TRADE Brazil is not selling cocoa beans to the International Cocoa Organization, ICCO, buffer stock, as spot prices for beans in the interior area are 20 to 25 pct higher than levels which would be paid by the ICCO buffer stock manager, trade sources in the major producing state Bahia said.     The scarcity of beans because of the effects of drought on the current temporao harvest has pushed prices well above international levels, the sources noted.     The only buyers are bean exporters or local processors covering previously contracted commitments, they added.     If sales were made they would be executed by individual exporting companies which are members of the Brazilian Cocoa Trade Commission, they said.  Reuter 3;

The financial daily quoted Schlesinger as saying in an interview that the bank would try to maintain current interest rate levels for the time being.     He also told the newspaper he saw no need for large-scale intervention in the foreign exchange market because exchange rates are stable.      Earlier, Schlesinger told a press conference that the Bundesbank would continue its policy of maintaining short-term interest rates at a low level for currency stability.

19870601	BURLINGTON <BUR> HEARING TO CONTINUE TOMORROW U.S. District Court Judge Eugene A. Gordon said he plans to issue a decision tomorrow on Burlington Industries Inc's request for an injunction to stop Samjens Acquisition Corp's takeover bid for the company.     Wall Street sources have said the outcome of the case could be pivotal in determining the winner in the fierce takeover battle for Burlington, the largest u.s. textile maker.     Gordon presided over six hours of argument today by lawyers for Burlington and Samjens, a partnership formed by Dominion Textile Inc and New York investor Asher Edelman.     Hearings are scheduled to continue tomorrow. A preliminary injunction would hold up Samjens 2.47 billion dlr offer until the case is decided.     Burlington had previously agreed to a 2.44 billion dlr buyout from Morgan Stanley Group Inc <MS>, one dlr per share lower than a sweetened 77 dlr per share bid made by Samjens last week. Burlington has not responded to the new Samjens offer.     Burlington has alleged in its lawsuit that Edelman and Dominion used illegally obtained confidential information about the company in making their takeover attempt.       That information, Burlington said, was provided by James Ammeen, a former Burlington executive, through PaineWebber Group Inc <PWJ>. Ammeen, who had worked for Burlington for 23 years, had as many as 12 divisions with 50 pct of Burlington's sales reporting to him. When he left Burlington in November, 1985, Burlington said he signed a contract promising never to divulge inside information about the company.     Burlington lawyers said shortly after he left he began working with a PaineWebber employee on a hostile plan to "takeover the company, dismember the company and displace its management," Burlington lawyer Hubert Humphrey said.     Samjens lawyers acknowledged it received information from PaineWebber, but argued the information was public information and could be obtained either from texitle industry analysts or Burlington's public financial statements.     Burlington lawyers said PaineWebber and Ammeen met with Edelman and Dominion in November and continued to meet with them until a couple of days before Edelman and Dominion went public April 24 with their intention to take over the company. Burlington lawyers claim Dominion's board decided to attempt a takeover of Burlington after Ammeen met with the board in February.     Burlington lawyers said Edelman and Dominion held discussions with PaineWebber and Ammeen about acting as financial advisers to Samjens. But they allege talks broke off because Painewebber and Ammeen could not satisfy Edelman and dominion with a written statement that they did not provide inside information.     Lawyers for Samjens contended that Painewebber and Ammeen withdrew as potential advisers because Burlington chairman Frank Greenberg had called a PaineWebber executive and threatened legal action if PaineWebber got involved in an effort to takeover Burlilgnton.     "The ultimate question is not the price per share or the profit, but rather the permissable standards of conduct for those who would takeover an American company," said burlington lawyer Humphrey.     Burlington lawyers also contended that Burlington, as the largest manufacturer of denim in the United States, would be in violation of anti-trust laws if it acquired Dominion, Canada's largest textile maker. Dominion has denim manufacturing plants in Georgia, which would reduce competition in the denim market, the lawyers said.     Samjens' lawyers discounted the concern. They said the market for denim is more fragmented than Burlington contends and that Burlington has the ability to switch between light weight and heavy weight denim production as demand and price dictate.     Samjens lawyers also pointed to a lawsuit filed by Burlington in Canada, in which it said it was considering a bid for Dominion. "Surely, what would have been sauce for the goose would have been sauce for the gander," said Sidney Rosdeitcher, a Samjens lawyer.  Reuter 3;

19870601	CHINA PROVINCE BECOMES GRAIN IMPORTER The south China province of Guangdong is importing millions of tonnes of grain a year from overseas and other parts of China because farmers have switched from grain to more profitable crops, the Peking Review magazine said.     The official magazine said the province's grain area fell to 4.33 mln hectares in 1985 from 5.7 mln in 1978 out of a total farmland area of 7.4 mln hectares.     Farmers have switched to cash crops such as sugarcane, bananas, oranges, papaya and freshwater fish-farming, in part to supply major consumer markets in Hong Kong and Macao, the magazine said. It gave no 1986 area figures.     The magazine said China aims to keep 80 pct of national farmland under grain, 10 pct under cash crops and 10 pct under other crops, although the ratio will vary from place to place.     It said primitive cultivation methods, labour-intensity and low productivity make grain the least profitable farm commodity. Farmers in one central region of China can from 0.1 hectare earn 2,250 yuan a year from vegetables, 375-450 yuan from cotton or 225 yuan from grain, it added.     It said consumer prices for foodgrain can be adjusted only gradually as part of a reform of the entire pricing system.  REUTER 3;

19870601	COCOA ORIGINS DISMAYED BY BUFFER STOCK ACTION Traders recently returned from West Africa say some producers there are dismayed by the ineffective action so far by the International Cocoa Organization (ICCO) buffer stock manager on buffer stock purchases.     One trader said some West African producers are annoyed the Buffer Stock manager is not playing his part as required by the International Cocoa Pact to stabilise prices from current lows.     So far, only 21,000 tonnes of second hand cocoa have been taken up for buffer stock purposes and this, traders noted, only on an intermittent basis.     They noted the purchases, of 8,000 tonnes in the first week he bought and 13,000 in the second, are well short of the limitations of no more than 5,000 tonnes in one day and 20,000 in one week which the cocoa agreement places on him.     The traders recently returned from West Africa say producers there are unhappy about the impact on cocoa prices so far, noting producing countries are part of the international cocoa pact and deserve the same treatment as consumers.     London traders say terminal market prices would have to gain around 300 stg a tonne to take the ICCO 10-day average indicator to its 1,935 sdr per tonne midway point (or reference price).     However, little progress has been made in that direction, and the 10-day average is still well below the 1,600 sdr lower intervention level at 1,562.87 from 1,569.46 previously.     The buffer stock manager may announce today he will be making purchases tomorrow, although under the rules of the agreement such action is not automatic, traders said.     Complaints about the inaction of the buffer stock manager are not confined to West African producers, they observed.     A Reuter report from Rotterdam quoted industry sources there saying Dutch cocoa processors also are unhappy with the intermittent buffer stock buying activities.     In London, traders expressed surprise that no more than 21,000 tonnes cocoa has been bought so far against total potential purchases under the new agreement of 150,000 tonnes. Carryover holdings from the previous International Cocoa Agreement in the stock total 100,000 tonnes.     Terminal prices today rose by up to 10 stg a tonne from Friday's close, basis July at its high of 1,271.     It seems that when the buffer stock manager is absent from the market, prices go up, while when he declares his intention to buy, quite often the reverse applies, traders said.  Reuter 3;

19870601	COMINCO <CLT.TO> SEES MEETING WITH STRIKING UNION LOCALS Cominco Ltd said it expects to meet today with two of five United Steelworkers of America locals on strike at its Trail smelter and Kimberley, B.C. lead-zinc mine, a Cominco spokesman said.     It had no meeting scheduled with the other three striking locals, which rejected a tentative three-year contract Saturday, Cominco spokesman Richard Fish said.     Fish said the pact that was rejected contained a cost of living increase tied to the Canadian consumer price index, but no wage increase. With 81 pct of the membership voting, 54.5 pct voted no and 45.5 pct voted yes, the union said.     The three locals represent about 2,600 production and maintenance workers, while the remaining two locals cover about 600 office and technical workers.     The office and technical workers last negotiated May 21. Production at Trail and Kimberley has been shut down since the strike began May 9 and Cominco has had to declare force majeure, which means the company may be unable to honor contracts for products from the smelter and mine.     Each of the five locals have separate contracts, all of which expired April 30, but the main issues are similar.     The Trail smelter, about 400 miles east of Vancouver, produced 240,000 long tons of zinc and 110,000 long tons of lead last year. The Sullivan mine at Kimberley, about 450 miles east of Vancouver, produced 2.2 mln long tons of ore last year, most for processing at the Trail smelter.     The smelter also produced cadmium, bismuth and indium.     Trail smelter revenue was 356 mln Canadian dlrs in 1986.  Reuter 3;
19870601	COMINCO <CLT.TO> UNION REJECTS CONTRACT Three United Steelworkers of America locals on strike at Cominco Ltd rejected a tentative three-year contract, a union representative said.

The locals' bargaining committees are expected to meet and prepare for the reopening of negotiations with Cominco, he said.      The three locals cover about 2,600 production and maintenance workers at Cominco's Trail smelter and Kimberley, B.C. lead-zinc mine.      Output at both sites has been shut down since the production and maintenance workers, along with about 600 office and technical workers, went on strike May nine.           The two Steelworkers locals representing the office and technical workers have not negotiated since May 21.      The strike caused Cominco to declare force majeire, which means the company may not be able to honor contracts for products from the smelter and mine.     Each of the five locals have separate contracts, all of which expired April 30, but the main issues are similar.

19870601	COMPROMISE SEEN LIKELY OVER CONOCO-STATOIL DISPUTE Norway is expected to seek a compromise solution to defuse a row between Den Norske Stats Oljeselskap A/S <STAT.OL> (Statoil) and Conoco Norge A/S over which firm will operate the Heidrun oil field, government sources said.     The sources, who asked not to be named, said the government will likely recommend that Conoco be allowed to continue as the field's operator through the development phase, with Statoil taking over only after production starts in the early 1990s.     Oil Minister Arne Oeien told Reuters the government had today discused the Heidrun matter but that no final decision had been taken and several questions remained unresolved.     It was unlikely the government would announce its decision on Heidrun operatorship until after Thursday's cabinet meeting and after discussing a proposed solution with both companies, the sources added.     This spring Norway's state-owned oil company Statoil exercised an option in the Heidrun field exploration license that, if approved by the government, would allow it to relieve Conoco as Heidrun operator, a move sharply criticised by Conoco.     Heidrun is often cited by the government and industry as the most likely candidate for the first field development project on the Haltenbanken exploration tract off central Norway.  Reuter 3;
19870601	COMPUTER ASSOC. <CA> BOLSTERS HAND AGAINST IBM Computer Associates International Inc's 800 mln dlr merger with Uccel Corp <UCE> will eliminate its strongest rival, but the company still faces stiff competition from International Business Machines Corp <IBM>, Wall Street analysts said.      "IBM is still the ruling force in mainframe systems software," said Scott Smith, an analyst with Donaldson Lufkin and Jenrette.     "But the combination of the two companies will clearly present a much stronger front," he said.     Besides IBM, "Computer Associates will be far and away the most powerful company in the field," added E.F. Hutton analyst Terence Quinn.     That field is a segment of the market known as system utilities, or software packages that boost the productivity of a company's data processing facilities by increasing the speed, power and efficiency of large mainframe computers.     The merger of Uccel and Computer Associates combines the two biggest systems utilities suppliers other than IBM. Analysts said the remaining players are mostly small firms that will find the competition much harder than in the past.     For Computer Associates, the merger with Uccel caps a six-year acquisition campaign that has vaulted the Garden City, N.Y.-based company to the top of the software industry.     When the deal is completed sometime in August, the company's revenues will exceed 450 mln dlrs, pushing it past  Microsoft Corp <MFST> as the world's largest independent software vendor.     Computer Associates founder and chairman Charles B. Wang took the company public in 1981, and since then he has bought 15 companies and boosted annual sales from 18.5 mln to 309.3 mln dlrs for the year ended March 31.     Liemandt took charge of Wyly, sold off its non-computer businesses and decided that it would focus solely on mainframe computer software. In 1984, the company was renamed Uccel Corp.     Liemandt, who said he will leave the company after the merger is completed, also turned to acquisitions for growth.     On the last day of 1986, Uccel completed the buyouts of six companies for a total of about 60 mln dlrs.     For 1986, it earned 17.0 mln dlrs, or 1.01 dlrs a share, on sales of 141.5 mln dlrs.     The agreement took industry analysts by surprise, largely because the companies had been such bitter rivals. Also, Dallas-based Uccel had engineered a strong comeback from the dark days of 1982, when, as Wyly Corp, it lost 7.7 mln dlrs, or 56 cts a share.    At that time, Wyly owned a potpourri of 13 different businesses, only three of which were involved in computer software. In 1983, Walter Haefner, a Swiss financier and a major Wyly investor, lured Gregory J. Liemandt away from his job as chairman of General Electric Co's <GE> computer services unit.     Computer Associates' Wang and Uccel's Liemandt said at a news conference that the merger would give computer users a single source for a wide range of software products.     In addition to system utilities, Computer Associates also sell products for microcomputers, while Uccel has made inroads in the applications software market, where analysts said it has been successful with accounting and banking systems.     Wang said Computer Associates would continue to support and enhance both companies' product lines, but noted that the company will eventually weed out duplicate offerings. He said about 20 pct of the companies' products overlap.     Analysts said the merger would dilute the holdings of current Computer Associates shareholders by about 10 pct. But they joined Wang in forecasting that the deal will not dilute Computer Associates' earnings for the current fiscal year.     Quinn of E.F. Hutton said Wang has a proven track record of completing acquisitions without earnings dilution. Therefore, he said he would not change his 1988 earnings estimate of 1.05 dlrs a share.     Wang said he would look closely at the combined operations of the two companies and cut duplication in sales, marketing and research and development.     Analysts said Computer Associates paid a premium for Uccel. Based on Friday's closing price, the company will swap 47.50 dlrs worth of its stock for each Uccel share, which is nearly 33 times Uccel's 1987 estimated earnings of 1.45 dlrs a share.     Stephen T. McClellan of Merrill Lynch Research said most software companies are currently valued at about 20 times per-share earnings. But the analyst said Uccel was worth the premium because of its earnings potential and customer base.      Wang said Haefner, the Swiss investor, would hold about 25 pct of Computer Associates stock after the merger. He currently owns 58 pct of Uccel.     The executive said the merger would not alter his target of maintaining sales and earnings growth of 30 pct to 35 pct.     In addition, he said he expects no problems in having the deal cleared by the antitrust division of the U.S. Justice Department.     Uccel's Liemandt declined to say what he will do after the merger, but he did not rule out working together with Wang.   Reuter 3;

Closing of the transaction is anticipated in August, the companies said. The companies said the resulting company wil retain the name Computer Associates International Inc.

19870601	CONGRESSMAN SAYS U.S. UNPREPARED FOR OIL CUTOFF Rep. Mike Synar said today that while President Reagan is ready to use military force to protect Kuwait tankers in the Gulf, the United States is ill-prepared at home to deal with a new energy crisis.     Synar, Democrat of Oklahoma, made his remarks in comments on a study by the General Accounting Office (GAO) on the U.S. participation in the 1985 test of the emergency oil sharing program of the International Energy Agency.     The IEA, an alliance of 21 oil consuming countries, was formed after the 1973-74 Arab oil embargo to find ways to deal with any future oil cutoff.     Synar said, "the president is prepared to take military action to protect Kuwaiti oil tankers but has been unwilling to take less dangerous, equally-important action to prepare our nation for the next energy crisis."     Reagan said the U.S. military would protect Kuwaiti oilers to assure the West of a continuing supply of Middle East oil, increasingly being threatened by the Iranian-Iraqi war. Synar, who asked for the GAO report after criticism of U.S. action in a previous IEA test, said the United States successfully advocated a test limited to training participants in oil sharing procedures and the system's mechanical aspects.

19870601	CONT'L MATERIALS <CUO> ENDS CONSIDERATION OF BID Continental Materials Corp said its directors decided not to give further consideration to "business combination" proposed by a stockholder group that holds 5.2 pct of Continental Materials stock.     Continental Materials said the offer had been received from Continental Associates, a group of St. Louis businessmen.     According to Continental Materials, the group said May 11 it might boost its stake in Continental Materials. But the group also said in a letter last week to the company that the group had no financing. The board "did not consider it an official offer," a Continental Materials spokeswoman said.  Reuter 3;

19870601	DUTCH COCOA PROCESSORS UNHAPPY WITH ICCO BUFFER Dutch cocoa processors are unhappy with the intermittent buying activities of the International Cocoa Organization's buffer stock manager, industry sources told Reuters.     "The way he is operating at the moment is doing almost nothing to support the market. In fact he could be said to be actively depressing it," one company spokesman said.     Including the 3,000 tonnes he acquired on Friday, the total amount of cocoa bought by the buffer stock manager since he recently began support operations totals 21,000 tonnes.     Despite this buying, the price of cocoa is well under the 1,600 Special Drawing Rights, SDRs, a tonne level below which the bsm is obliged to buy cocoa off the market.     "Even before he started operations, traders estimated the manager would need to buy at least up to his 75,000 tonnes maximum before prices moved up to or above the 1,600 SDR level, and yet he appears reluctant to do so," one manufacturer said.     "We all hoped the manager would move into the market to buy up to 75,000 tonnes in a fairly short period, and then simply step back," he added.     "The way the manager is only nibbling at the edge of the market at the moment is actually depressing sentiment and the market because everyone is holding back from both buying and selling waiting to see what the manager will do next," one processor said.     "As long as his buying tactics remain the same the market is likely to stay in the doldrums, and I see no indication he is about to alter his methods," he added.     Processors and chocolate manufacturers said consumer prices for cocoa products were unlikely to be affected by buffer stock buying for some time to come.  Reuter 3;
19870601	DUTCH OFFICIAL RATE CUT SEEN STILL LIKELY A cut of about half a percentage point in Dutch official interest rates is still in prospect, although economists said the timing would depend on Bundesbank moves.     Speculation has been rife that the Dutch Central Bank, encouraged by a strong guilder/mark relationship and wide premiums for Dutch money and capital market rates over German, might lower rates without the Bundesbank moving first.     Last month, the Central Bank lowered its special advances rate to 5.1 pct from 5.25 pct after the Bundesbank dropped its repurchase tender rate to 3.55 pct from 3.8 pct.     That rate has remained in force, just holding above the five pct official secured loans rate which governs commercial bank borrowings.     Given a strong guilder, a further fall in the West German repo rate would trigger a lower special advances tariff, forcing an official Dutch rate cut, analysts said.     In February, when the Bundesbank cut its discount rate to three pct from 3.5 pct, the Central Bank only lowered money market rates and removed a surcharge over the secured loans rate on lending under its three month credit quota.     Since then, however, both the Central Bank and Finance Ministry have made it clear they favour lower official rates.     In April, Central Bank President Wim Duisenberg said he would follow any Bundesbank cut, and last week the Finance Ministry expressed satisfaction when it raised 2.25 billion guilders with a six pct coupon state loan priced at 100.10 pct for an effective yield of 5.98 pct, the lowest since 1965.     Technically, analysts said, there has to be a difference between the secured loans rate which applies to lending under the credit quota, and the tariff on special advances which add extra liquidity to the money market.     Bank economists and dealers said a West German move to further lower the rate on securities repurchase pacts would result in the Central Bank easing the special advance rate, provided the guilder/mark relationship permitted.     The Central Bank aims to keep the guilder stable around its parity value within the European Monetary System of 112.673 guilders per 100 marks.     Today, foreign exchange buying pushed the mark up 10 guilder cents to 112.705 guilders per 100 at the fix, a level that would not permit a change in the interest rate differential between West Germany and the Netherlands, dealers said.     An economist at ABN Bank said he expected West German and Dutch interest rates to ease in the short term. However, he said new wage agreements in West Germany had raised inflation expectations which would put upward pressure on interest rates in the longer term.     In the Netherlands, the inflation outlook for 1987 is nil, or even negative, while the latest official economic forecasts point to a falling rate of economic growth.     "It will depend on the outcome of collective wage agreement negotiations here whether there could be cost push inflation," the ABN economist said.     He said Dutch money supply growth, which ran at 3.4 pct in January, could also contribute to some inflation.     At Amro Bank, a leading analyst said inflation could run to two pct next year. The bank expects Dutch capital market rates, currently averaging around 6.1 pct, to stop easing in the second half of this year and stabilize around 5.6 pct.     Analysts said an official rate cut could trigger a buying spree on the bond market which would bring yields down, probably only temporarily, while money rates could fall below five pct.     Currently, all periods are traded at 5.12 to 5.25 pct in the money market.  REUTER 3;
19870601	EC MINISTERS CONSIDER CUTBACKS IN STEEL SUPPORT A new steel quota system that would strictly limit European Community (EC) support to the industry could be forced on producers if they fail to find their own solution quickly, officials said.     EC industry ministers meeting here considered two key proposals aimed at cutting back surplus capacity by 30 mln tonnes by 1990.     The first would limit the current quota system, which has protected EC output for seven years, only to flat products and heavy sections, thereby forcing other types of steel products into free market competition.     The second proposal would link continuation of a quota system with progress toward plant closures, although less than a month ago the EC steelmakers' lobby group Eurofer said they had abandoned efforts to close plants voluntarily.     The ministers stopped short of imposing their own solution immediately, instead urging steel producers to try again to reach agreement on voluntary cutbacks.     The EC Commission has said it will come up with detailed proposals in July on the future of the EC steel industry and EC industry ministers meet again in September to reach a final decision.

19870601	ENTERTAINMENT MAKES BUYOUT OFFER TO CRAZY EDDIE Entertainment Marketing Inc <EM> said it has made an offer to the board of Crazy Eddie Inc to acquire all outstanding shares of Crazy Eddie Inc for eight dlrs a share in cash.     Entertainment said the offer would be conducted through a negotiated merger with a new corporation to be formed by Entertainment Marketing.     Entertaiment said it has requested an early meeting with Crazy Eddie Inc's board and that it has committed 50 mln dlrs toward the purchase of the shares including those already purchased.         The company also said it has retained Dean Witter Reynolds Inc to assist in raising the balance of the financing.     According to Entertainment, its company and its chairman own about 4.3 pct of Crazy Eddie's currently outstanding shares.     Additionally, the company said it is willing to negotiate all aspects of its offer and is willing to consider a transaction which would be tax free to Crazy Eddie's shareholders.  Reuter 3;
19870601	ENTERTAINMENT MARKETING TOPS CRAZY EDDIE OFFER A quickly growing Texas-based distributor of electronics products offered 240 mln dlrs for Crazy Eddie Inc <crzy>, the leading New York City electronics retailer, or one dlr per share more than its founder has bid.     The 8-dlr-a-share offer by Entertainment Marketing Inc <em> for Crazy Eddie comes less than two weeks after founder Eddie Antar and a firm controlled by the Belzbergs of Canada announced a bid to take the 32-store Crazy Eddie chain private.     Analysts said Entertainment Marketing, whose revenues and profits quadrupled in 1986, may be looking to break into the highly competitive New York City retail market for consumer electronics, the nation's biggest, at a time the fortunes of electronics retailers have sagged.     The analysts questioned whether Houston-based Entertainment Marketing, founded by a former electronics retailer but whose present buinesses are primarily as wholesale distributors, had the management expertise for retailing or was merely trying to drive up the price of the Crazy Eddie shares it already owns.     "I have mixed feelings," said analyst Dennis Telzrow of Eppler, Geurin and Turner, a Dallas brokerage. "On the one hand it's probably a cheap price. On the other hand, does Entertainment Marketing have the management talent to run it and will the Crazy Eddie people leave?"     "It's a risky strategy for Entertainment Marketing," said analyst Eliot Laurence of Wessels Arnold and Henderson, a Minneapolis brokerage. "Electronics retailing is very management concentrated; they'd want to keep Crazy Eddie's management in place."     Laurence said that, since Entertainment Marketing already owns 4.3 percent of Crazy Eddie's 31.3 million shares, it may be trying to get the Antar-Belzberg group to increase its 7-dlr-a-share offer.     Shares of Crazy Eddie, which have jumped from the high 4-dlr range to above 7 dlrs since the Antar-Belzberg bid was announced May 20, rose another 50 cents Monday to 8.375 a share in over-the- counter trading.      Antar, the reclusive founder of the chain in the New York City, Philadelphia and Connecticut areas, said last month that his group controlled 14 percent of Crazy Eddie's shares.     A Crazy Eddie spokesman said the company's board has taken no decision on the Antar-Belzberg offer, worth some 187 mln dlrs since they own more shares than Entertainment Marketing. He would not comment on the new offer.     Entertainment Marketing sells computer products such as disk drives and other, often discounted electronics goods to retailers, primarily in the southwest, and directly to consumers by cable television.     In fiscal 1986, ending last January, its revenues rose to 87.9 mln dlrs from 21.3 mln dlrs the previous year. Net profit went to 3.2 mln dlrs from 750,000 dlrs in 1985.     Entertainment Marketing, whose chief executive officer, Elias Zinn, once ran an electronics retailing business, said in a statement it had committed 50 mln dlrs toward the purchase of Crazy Eddie and had retained Dean Witter Reynolds Inc to assist in financing the balance.     Analyst Telzerow estimated that the company would have to borrow about 100 mln dlrs to complete the proposed buyout since Crazy Eddie has cash and other assets worth about the same amount.     Shares of Entertainment Marketing were up 12.5 cents Monday to 9.50.  Reuter 3;
19870601	EQUITICORP TASMAN TO BID FOR MONIER LTD <Equiticorp Tasman Ltd> (ETL) said it will offer 4.15 dlrs a share cash for all the issued capital of Monier Ltd <MNRA.S>, currently the subject of a 3.80 dlrs a share bid by CSR Ltd <CSRA.S>.     Alternatively, ETL will offer three shares plus 82 cents cash for each Monier share, it said in a statement.     As previously reported, ETL moved into the market for Monier shares last week, taking its stake to 13.7 pct by Friday.     It now holds 14.99 pct, the maximum allowed without Foreign Investment Review Board (FIRB) approval. ETL is classified as foreign because of its New Zealand base.     The ETL cash offer values Monier's issued capital of 156.28 mln shares at 649 mln dlrs, against 593 mln for the CSR bid.     Based on the current price of ETL shares of 1.05 dlrs, the alternative is worth 3.97 dlrs per share, but ETL said the value placed on its shares for the offer aproximates to the diluted asset backing of ETL as at March 31.     ETL said the offer will have no minimum acceptance conditions and will be subject to Australian foreign investment and U.S. Hart-Scott-Rodino anti-trust clearances.     ETL chairman Allan Hawkins said in the statement that the shareholding in Monier was a long term investment.     ETL and its <Feltex International Ltd> associate have targetted the building products sector as an area of expansion and Monier fits well with this aim, he added.     Monier chairman Bill Locke said in a separate statement that the independent directors of Monier intend to recommend acceptance of the ETL bid in the absence of a higher bid.     He also said Monier will not now proceed with the one-for-two bonus issue announced with its interim results on March 19 in view of the proposed takeover bids.     As previously reported, the CSR offer involves a complex put and call option deal with Monier's major shareholder, Redland Plc <RDLD.L>, which gives Redland the choice of accepting the CSR offer for its 49.8 pct stake or moving to 50.1 pct within six months of the bid closing.     CSR officials have made it clear that they see Redland taking the second option, resulting in the two companies running Monier as a joint venture.     CSR officials have also said they had no intention of raising the company's bid for Monier after ETL's intervention became public last week.  REUTER 3;

19870601	FRENCH SAY WHEAT STOCKS FORECAST NO SURPRISE The U.S. Department of Agriculture's forecast that French end-of-season soft wheat stocks will almost double in 1987/88 is premature but would not be surprising, according to French cereal organisation officials.     The Cereals Intervention Board, ONIC, Wheat Producers' Association and the National Union of Agricultural and Cereal Cooperatives have not yet forecast 1987/88 exports or end-of-season stocks.     However, the officials said the USDA's figure of end 1987/88 stocks at 5.03 mln tonnes against 1986/87's 2.87 mln was not surprising given a record high yield forecast in April.     The French Feed Cereals Research Institute, ITCF, forecast in mid-April an average yield of 6.58 tonnes per hectare for soft wheat in 1987/88 compared with 5.6 tonnes in 1986/87 and the record high yield of 6.5/6.6 tonnes in 1984.     This would result in a French soft wheat harvest of around 31 mln tonnes against 25.5 mln in 1986/87, given a Ministry of Agriculture estimate of area planted of 4.66 mln hectares against 4.61 mln in 1986/87.     ONIC's first preliminary forecast of the 1987/88 campaign will be released at the beginning of September, an ONIC official said.     Soft wheat exports in 1987/88 were extremely difficult to estimate at this stage, both within the European Community and to non-EC countries, an ONIC official said.     He said, however, that among countries to which France could increase its wheat exports were Egypt and the Maghreb countries (Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia), he said.     The USDA's forecast of an 11.65 mln tonne maize crop in 1987/88 against 11.48 mln in 1986/87, while again premature, was not out of line with estimates of the French Maize Producers Association, AGPM, an AGPM official said.     Maize plantings would be down in 1987/88 but yields were expected to be higher, the AGPM official said.     It estimated 1987/88 maize plantings of 1.73 mln hectares, down seven pct from the 1.87 mln hectares planted in 1986/87.  Reuter 3;

The debentures had been convertible at 34 dlrs per share. Harcourt's May 26 announcement said the conversion price would be adjusted according to the indenture covering the securities.

The exploratory well, spudded at a depth of 2,140 metres, yielded 2,000 barrels of oil and 180,000 cubic metres of gas per day, he said.     "The well, one of the four structures drilled in the area 80 km north-west of Bombay, indicates good prospects of both oil and gas.

19870601	INVESTORS MAY TAKE COMPUTERLAND PUBLIC The investor group that has agreed to buy <Computerland Corp> will likely take the leading personal computer retailer public or sell it to other investors, industry analysts said.     "Now's a good time," said Joe Levy of International Data Corp. "The personal computer industry has bottomed out and is on the way up again," he said.     Earlier today, closely held Computerland, the largest PC retailing chain in the country, said it agreed to be bought by an investor group led by E.M. Warburg Pincus and Co, New York.     Neither Computerland, which is 96 pct owned by its founder, William H. Millard, nor E.M. Warburg, a money management and venture capital firm, would disclose the value of the transaction.     Analysts estimated that Computerland, whose 800 stores generated 1.4 billion dlrs in sales last year, would fetch  150 mln dlrs to 250 mln dlrs. Computerland franchise owners pay royalties averaging 5.9 pct to the parent company.     Officials for E.M. Warburg referred all questions to Computerland. Computerland officials could not immediately be reached for comment.     E.M. Warburg currently manages 1.5 billion dlrs in venture capital funds, and its past investments have included Mattel Inc <MAT> and the Ingersoll newspaper chain. It is also a money manager, with 3.5 billion dlrs under management.    Although the PC retailers are benefitting from the strong upturn in PC sales, analysts said Computerland must make key changes if it is to fend off advances from rivals like Businessland Inc <BUSL.O> and Tandy Corp's <TAN> Radio Shack stores. "The name of the game now is outbound sales forces, customer service and customer support," said Levy of International Data.      Relations between Computerland and its franchise owners have mellowed recently after Millard was forced to give up managment control of the company in 1985.

19870601	LATIN DEBTORS MAKE NEW PUSH FOR DEBT RELIEF Rising interest rates and protectionist trade policies had prompted a new push by Latin American nations to win debt relief, regional foreign and finance ministry officials said here.     Officials of the Cartagena group of 11 debtor nations met here this week to draw up new proposals in reaction to what they called a deteriorating world panorama, and Citicorp's decision to create reserves against third world loans.     (SEE ECRA FOR SPOTLIGHT HEADLINES)     "We are looking at trade, interest rates and financial flows.....In order to put forward a basis for some permanent solutions," Mexico's public credit director Angel Gurria said.     Recent developments have led to moves for a summit of Latin American presidents and debate on new solutions.     Ideas include schemes to link debt payments to trade, and proposals for stable interest rates. The latter was proposed in a letter this week from Cartagena to G-7 leaders who are due to attend a summit in Venice this month.     Another idea is to include debt under Gatt negotiations, but Cartegena ministers have yet to endorse any proposals.     Speaking earlier in New York, Uruguay's Foreign Minister and Cartagena group chairman Enrique Iglesias said Citicorp's decision could discourage new lending. But it might help Cartagena's bid to have old and new debt treated separately.     The Cartagena group, which has not met at ministerial level for over a year, wants to repay debt contracted before the debt crisis at the low interest rates prevailing in the 1970s. It would pay new loans at current market rates.     "Many countries fear that what they have gained in months of arduous debt negotiations they can lose at a stroke with a one point rise in interest rates," one official here said.     "The new increase in interest rates has come precisely when we thought they had still not come down enough," Iglesias said.     Latin American officials are also concerned that varying interest spreads granted to different debtor nations could generate discord, as with the Philippines' recent protest at being given less favourable terms than Argentina.     There has been speculation Venezuela would demand a cut in its 7/8 pct spread, but public finances director Jorge Marcano said here there were no plans to renegotiate terms.     This week's meeting came after three Latin American presidents meeting in Montevideo called for stable interest rates on the region's 380 billion dlr foreign debt. It was called to review developments since the last ministerial meeting in February 1986 and to think up new ideas.     Since the last ministerial meeting there have been some advances, such as Mexico's growth-oriented 77 billion dlr loan and refinancing package agreed last September. But there have also been setbacks, like Brazil's payments moratorium.     The loans expected in the Baker plan have not materialized and debtors have been forced to browbeat reluctant banks.     "We have clearly stretched the restructuring process to its limits and and the question is now where do we go from here?" a senior Mexican foreign ministry official said.     Existing debt strategy has been based on nursing debtor economies back to a position where they can again service their debts and qualify for new loans.     But after five years of economic adjustment, Latin American debtors are currently unable to raise voluntary credits, with the exception of Colombia. Only Venezuela is paying back principal. Most countries have no prospect of paying their debts in the foreseeable future.     Citicorp has made clear its decision to move three billion dlrs to reserves does not mean it is writing-off the loans.     Latin American officials here said Citicorp's move would probably boost trading of discounted third world debt in the secondary market, implicitly downvaluing the amount owed. But they said it might make new lending even more remote.     Discounted debt can be bought by foreign investors through debt-equity schemes that generate new resources for debtor economies. Chile and Mexico are currently front-runners in this field, but most Latin American officials see these schemes as limited and no panacea for the overall problem.     Most Latin officials set greater store on building up export income than on debt-equity schemes.     Exports hit 97.7 billion dlrs in 1984, cutting the region's debt service ratio to 36 pct, but they fell to 78.3 billion last year. So, even though interest rates had dropped the ratio hardly changed.     The Cartagena group has called for the debt-trade link to be recognized before, but has not made detailed proposals.     Officials said initiatives discussed here would be submitted to foreign and finance ministers of the 11 nations, before IMF and World Bank annual meetings later this year.  REUTER 3;
19870601	LITTLE REACTION TO COMEX PRICE LIMIT REMOVAL The elimination of price limits on precious metals contracts trading at the Commodity Exchange in New York appears to be having little effect on the market, analysts said.     "There is nothing apparent from the change," said William O'Neill, director of futures research at Elders Futures Inc. "The market has not approached the old price limits and trading is relative quiet, in narrow ranges," he added.     Gold futures, which previously had a limit of 25 dlrs on market moves in most back months, were about 7.00 dlrs weaker in the nearby contracts amid thin conditions, traders said.     On May 5, COMEX did away with price limits on the two contracts following spot after a volatile market in silver futures at the end of April caused severe disruptions.     During the last week of April, silver futures traded up and down the price limit in the back months, causing traders to rush into the spot contract to offset those moves, analysts said.  As a result, Elders' O'Neill said, there was much confusion, many unmatched trades, and large losses.     The COMEX fined Elders Futures and three other large firms a total of 100,000 dlrs for failure to resolve unmatched trades in a timely manner.     Silver futures were trading about 30-40 cts weaker in the nearby contracts amid quiet trading today.     O'Neill said the elimination of price limits on all COMEX metals futures would add caution to trading since all contracts could move any distance.     "This is amore realistic approach because the metals market is a 24 hours market and prices can move without limit," O'Neill said.     Paul Cain, a vice president at Shearson Lehman Brothers, said the elimination of price limits will cut back on panic buying or selling  and contribute to more orderly markets.      Reuter 3;
19870601	LITTLE REACTION TO REMOVAL COMEX DAILY LIMITS The elimination of limits on daily price fluctuations for metals futures contracts traded on the Commodity Exchange, COMEX, appears to be having little effect on the market, analysts said.     "There is nothing apparent from the change," said William O'Neill, director of futures research at Elders Futures Inc.     "The market has not approached the old price limits and trading is relative quiet, in narrow ranges," he said.     On May 5, COMEX eliminated price limits on the two contracts following each spot delivery in gold, silver, copper and aluminum futures after a review of its clearing operations, which were severely tested by a volatile market in silver futures at the end of April. COMEX announced Friday the lifting of all daily limits, effective today.     Gold futures, which previously had a limit of 25 dlrs per ounce in most back months, were about 7.00 dlrs weaker in the nearby contracts amid thin volume conditions, traders said.     Silver futures, previously limited at 50 cents in most back months, were trading about 30-40 cts weaker in the nearby contracts amid quiet trading today.     During the last week of April, silver futures often traded at the daily allowable limit amid concerns about inflation, the dollar, and other factors. Traders rushed into the spot, or unlimited, contract to offset those moves, analysts said.     As a result, O'Neill said, there was much confusion, many unmatched trades, and large losses for some traders.     The COMEX fined four large firms a total of 100,000 dlrs for failure to resolve unmatched trades in a timely manner.

19870601	MAJOR U.S. OIL PIPELINE SHUT DOWN BY FLOODS Flooding in the Red River on the Texas/Oklahoma border has shut down the Basin Pipeline, a 24-inch pipeline that transports as much as 300,000 barrels per day of sweet and sour crudes from Texas to Cushing, Okla, a Texaco Pipeline Co spokesman confirmed.     "The water is rushing by so fast that we can't get any divers down to assess the damage but there is some possibility that the pipeline could be up by the end of the week," a company source said.     The pipeline transmits roughly two-thirds sour crude and one-third sweet crude oil from the Midland, Texas region.     Texaco sources said that if the pipeline service is restored by Friday there would be little problem in restoring oil which has been lost to the flood.     "But if the pipeline is down more than 10 days it will be difficult to make up without prorationing and we would not like to proration this pipeline, if we don't have to."     The Basin Pipeline is jointly owned by Atlantic Richfield Corp <ARC>, Shell Oil Co, a subsidiary of the Royal Dutch/Shell Group <RD> and Texaco Inc <TX>, which is the pipeline's operator.      Peter Beutel, analyst at Elders Futures Inc, said crude oil futures contracts on New York Mercantile Exchange rose to new highs this afternoon following news of the pipeline break.     July crude futures of West Texas Intermediate traded up to 19.60 dlrs a barrel, a rise of more than 20 cts.     Cash market prices also firmed on the news with sellers of WTI raising offers to 19.60 dlrs a barrel.     Sour crudes, which would be most affected by the pipeline shutdown, however, were slow to react to the news with West Texas Sour and Alaska North Slope holding 50 cts to one dlr a barrel below WTI, respectively.     Dan Stevens, manager of public and government affairs at Texaco, said the company hopes to fix the pipeline in five days but that will depend on when the water level of the Red River recedes. There is already evidence that the water level is dropping and it appears the rain has stopped in the area affecting the pipeline, Stevens said.     He said the segment of the pipeline that was damaged was underground and at a distance from the Red River that flooded. The pipeline runs over the Red River and under the subsoil nearby, according to Stevens. He said some of this subsoil was apparently washed away.         The potential for environmental damage is being downplayed at this time despite the volume of oil that runs through this line.     Texaco's Stevens said that aerial surveillance has not found any crude on the water in the river or in Lake Texoma, which is nearby.  Reuter 3;

19870601	MAXWELL FILES SUIT TO STOP HARCOURT <HBJ> Publisher Robert Maxwell's British Printing and Communicaton Corp PLC said it filed a lawsuit in U.S. district court against Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc, its directors and advisers to stop, among other things, payment of the special dividend Harcourt is paying as part of its recapitalization.     The suit, filed in Manhattan, also names First Boston Corp <FBC> and seeks to void the issue by Harcourt of 40,000 shares of super voting preferred stock to First Boston Securities Corp and the issue of convertible voting preferred stock with 4,700,000 votes in the Harcourt employee stock ownership plan.     The preferred shares to be issued to First Boston have 8,160,000 votes. The suit, brought derivatively on behalf of Harcourt and individually in British Printing's capacity as a substantial holder of Harcourt common shares and 6-3/8 pct convertible debentures.     The suit alleges Harcourt's special dividend exceeds by more than one billion dlrs Harcout's surplus available for dividends under New York law and contstitutes a fraudulent conveyance.     The lawsuit also alleges that Harcourt failed to disclose that one consequence of the payment of the dividend, which it terms illegal, will be that shareholders will be liable to repay it.     Harcourt last week said it would pay 40 dlrs per share to stockholders as a special dividend. Harcourt also announced an extensive recapitalization plan, which analysts said was aimed at thwarting a takeover effort by British Printing.     British Printing last week withdrew its 44 dlr per share, or two billion dlr offer for Harcourt because of the recapitalizaton plan. At the time, it said it was reviewing its alternatives.     British Printing said it filed the suit after consultation with its advisers. Its lawsuit also alleges that Harcourt failed to disclose the effect of the special dividend on Harcourt 6-3/8 pct convertible debentures.     British Printing alleges the effect will be an enormous increase effective on the June eight record date for the dividend in the number of Harcourt common shares issuable upon conversion of the debentures. British Printing also charged  Harcourt is unlawfully coercing debenture holders to convert denbentures before the record date because Harcourt may not have enough authorized common shares to honor conversion after the date.     British Printing holds 460,600 shares and 5.6 mln dlrs worth of debentures.     The suit also alleges that management, the board of directors, and First Boston engaged in an illegal scheme of entrenchment through a combination of selling to First Boston Securities Corp the super voting preferred at a bargain price, the grant to the company employee stock plan of convertible voting preferred, the six mln share open market repurchase program and the manner in which its financing has been structured.

19870601	MAXWELL WOULD NOT RENEW BID IF SUIT FAILS British press magnate Robert Maxwell said his British Printing and Communication Corp Plc would not renew its bid for Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc <HBJ> if the lawsuit filed against Harcourt in New York today fails.

"I don't believe in chasing mirages," maxwell said.     British Printing filed suit in U.S. District Court in Manhattan to block what Maxwell called a fraudulent recapitalization announced by Harcourt last week.     Harcourt, in response to a hostile two billion dlr takeover proposal from Maxwell, planned a recapitalization that would pay shareholders 40 dlrs per share. Under the plan, it also said 40 pct of its shares will be controlled by its employees, management, and its financial adviser, First Boston Corp <FBC>.  Reuter 3;

Council president Tom Miller said he was disappointed by the court ruling and said the council will accelerate activities in support of an amendment to the 1930 Tariff Act that would address the objections outlined in the Trade Commission's ruling.     The Commission had said there was insufficient economic integration between the pork production industry and the pork packing industry to justify extending the duty on live hogs to fresh, chilled or frozen pork.     The legislation has already passed the House of Representatives and recently passed the Senate Finance Committee. It is expected to be considered by the full Senate by the end of the summer.

19870601	PAY N' PAK <PNP> GETS TWO OFFERS FOR COMPANY Pay N' Pak Stores Inc said it received two proposals in response to its previously announced solicitation of potential buyers for the company.     The company said it is evaluating the proposals from Paul Bilzerian and from a third party which is active in the leveraged buyout field but which Pay N' Pak declined to identify.     It said the Bilzerian proposal calls for shareholders to receive on a blended basis 16.67 dlrs in cash and 3.30 dlrs in liquidation value of cumulative exchangeable redeemable preferred stock for each common share.         Pay N' Pak said the second proposal is structured as a merger in which each holder would receive a combination of 17.50 dlrs in cash and 2.50 dlrs in liquidation value of 13-1/2 pct cumulative preferred.     The company said the dividend on the preferred offered by Bilzerian would be set so that in the opinion his financial advisor and the company's financial advisor the preferred would trade in the public market at its liquidation value.     Dividends on the preferred could be paid at the option of the surviving corporation in cash or additional shares of preferred for the first five years, it added..         Pay N' Pak said Bilzerian's proposal is subject to a physical inventory of merchandise at June 30. Bilzerian did not provide details with respect to financing of his proposal, which is not subject to a financing condition.     The company said dividends on the preferred being offered in the second proposal would be paid in additional preferred in the first three years and the preferred would be redeemed in years 12 and 13.     It said the second offer is contingent on the arrangement of financing, adding the party making the offer is confident of its ability to obtain the balance of the financing.         Pay N' Pak said the second proposal is conditioned upon a satisfactory agreement with the company's management regarding its equity participation in the new company.     The second party anticipates executing a letter of intent when it delivers its financing commitment to the Pay N' Pak board that would incorporate an expense reinbursement and option arrangement, the company said.

19870601	PEMEX OFFICIAL SAYS OPEC OUTPUT CRITICAL TO PRICE Crude oil prices could remain around 18 dlrs a barrel until the end of the year, but OPEC's decision on output at its next meeting would be the critical factor, an official of Mexico's state oil company, Petroleos Mexicanos (Pemex), told a group of Japanese businessmen.     Adrian Lajous, Pemex' executive vice president of international trade, said current OPEC output already appeared to be very near the 16.6 mln barrel per day level it set itself for the third quarter. "Production is surging ahead of what was originally planned, while demand is growing more slowly than envisaged a few months ago," he said.     He said OPEC had to look very carefully at what level of production in the third quarter would effectively sustain the 18 dlrs price, and that an increase to what had originally been envisaged might soften price levels.     The 13-member cartel is scheduled to meet on June 25 in Vienna to review its December accord on prices and output.     "I hope OPEC will follow a very conservative attitude in terms of volume decisions," Lajous said.     A repetition of what happened last year, when OPEC boosted output and sent oil prices tumbling down below 10 dlrs, is always there as a possibility, he said.     "I hope never again to go through the trauma of 1986. I expect other oil exporters have learned their lessons and discipline will be maintained," he said.     Lajous said there was still excess supply and as long as this remains there will be a tendency to instability in oil markets, but prices should remain around 18 to 19 dlrs during 1987 if output remains under control.     He said Saudi King Fahd's remarks last month, that increased production was not so important as long as incomes would not be affected by the output, were "very relevant and welcome from such a powerful producer."

19870601	PHILIPPINE COCONUT CHIEF TO LOBBY AGAINST EC TAX Philippine Coconut Authority (PCA) chairman Jose Romero said he would visit Brussels later this month to lobby against a proposed 100 pct European Community (EC) levy on vegetable oil imports.     "I intend to visit Brussels and talk to whoever is putting up this devilish scheme to impoverish third world countries like the Philippines," Romero said in an interview.     He said he did not know how much support the levy had within the EC but he said he believed those originally opposed to the tax were under pressure to change their position.     Romero said a group of EC members led by West Germany, the Netherlands, Denmark and Norway were opposed to the tax. But there was a danger some of them would be persuaded to change sides, and if that happened opposition could crumble.     Romero said another threat to exports lay in an EC warning that copra meal cake used in livestock feeds contained dangerous levels of aflatoxin, a carcinogenic chemical.     He said the EC standard of 0.02 parts of aflatoxin per million parts of meal, which EC countries had been asked to apply by October 1988, was too rigid. He said Philippine copra cake contained much higher levels of aflatoxin.     Aflatoxin comes from moulds which develop in copra when it is not properly dried or ground.     Romero said he would tell big buyers of copra meal in London that the Philippines was doing its best to meet EC standards. It was also trying to eliminate aflatoxin totally, but this was likely to take several years of research.     Copra meal exports were 817,641 tonnes or 35 pct of total coconut exports in 1986. The meal was worth 73.5 mln dlrs.     Romero said he would also visit Oxford University's department of agricultural economics to discuss ways of avoiding the copra process altogether.     "There are ways of producing coconut products outside of copra," Romero said. "We can process fresh coconut without drying the meat in the sun. Through the wet process we can process coconuts into other food or non-food products, or we can go to the chemical root."     He said there was a tendency for agricultural countries to become more protectionist and he expected export prices of coconut products to drop.     "In the long term we will be getting less and less for more and more production, and I'm not comfortable with that," he said.     With countries like Indonesia and Malaysia stepping up production of palm oil, a coconut oil substitute, palm oil output had risen nearly 70 pct since 1971, Romero said.     "To add to that the U.S. Soybean Association is spending billions of dollars to discredit palm oil and coconut oil by saying that they are polysaturated fats and bad for the heart," he said.     Romero said he expected coconut product export prices to stay up for the rest of the year. They would probably touch a high of 20 cents/pound from the current level of 18.59 cents, and a sharp rise from year-ago levels of 10.50 cents.     Romero said the Philippines was at the end of a five-year coconut production cycle which showed production tended to fall after two successive years of good harvests.     He said 1985 and 1986 were good harvests and this year, to add to the production fall, drought had affected output.     "Traders are stocking up and when they have overbought the prices will start declining again. The only sure way to keep prices stable is by processing, adding more value," he said.     Coconut farmers were being encouraged to intercrop by planting other cash crops between coconut trees, he said.     "A typical farm may have from 100 to 150 trees sitting on 10,000 square metres of land. That's a lot of space," Romero said. He said the government's proposed land reform program would exclude about 75 pct of the coconut farmers because they had less than the proposed seven-hectares of land.     "If the idea of land reform is to increase income levels, production and employment then it won't happen," he said.

19870601	REAGAN HINTS U.S. WANTS HELP IN PATROLLING GULF President Reagan said he would discuss the Mideast Gulf situation with allied leaders at next week's Venice economic summit and hinted he would seek their help in preserving free navigation.     In a speech prepared for delivery as the United States made plans to protect 11 Kuwaiti oil tankers from Iranian attack, Reagan said the American people were aware that "it is not our interests alone that are being protected."     Saying that allied dependence on gulf oil was no secret, Reagan declared, "During the upcoming summit in Venice, we will be discussing the common security interests shared by the western democracies in the MIDEAST Gulf.     "The future belongs to the brave. Free men should not cower before such challenges, and they should not expect to stand alone."     Reagan will meet the leaders of Britain, France, West Germany, Italy, Canada and Japan at the economic summit, which will take place in Venice June 8-10.         The 13th annual top-level meeting of the major industrial democracies will take place against a backdrop of rising congressional concern over Reagan's plan to protect gulf shipping and demands that the allies do more.      These concerns were heightened by the May 17 Iraqi missile attack on the U.S. frigate Stark which killed 37 seamen.     "They died while guarding a chokepoint of freedom, deterring aggression and reaffirming America's willingness to protect its vital interests," Reagan said.         In a pre-summit speech celebrating the 40th anniversary of the Marshall Plan, Reagan, who spoke to an audience of foreign affairs experts, also pledged to push for economic expansion by West Germany and Japan to bolster the world trading system.     "While the vibrancy of the U.S. economy has contributed enormously to the world expansion, preserving a growing world economy is the business of every member of the world trading community," he said.         "It will be made clear, especially to our friends in Japan and the Federal Republic of Germany, that growth-oriented domestic policies are needed to bolster the world trading system on which they depend."     Reagan coupled this appeal with a call for compliance with allied accords on exchange rate stability.     "Economic policy decisions made last year in Tokyo and at this year's meetings of Group of Seven finance ministers in Paris and in Washington cannot be ignored or forgotten," he said. "The commitments made at these meetings need to be translated into action."  Reuter 3;
19870601	RENISON GC AND CITY RESOURCES SET PNG GOLD VENTURE Renison Goldfields Consolidated Ltd <RGFJ.S> (RGC) and explorer <City Resources Ltd> have agreed in principle on a joint venture to re-examine the Bulolo alluvial gold field in Papua New Guinea, City Resources said.     City Resources would progressively earn up to 66.66 pct of RGC's Prospecting Authority 585, which covers all the field, by spending a total of 6.5 mln kina, it said in a statement.     It said it believed Bulolo was not fully exploited in the past, noting the literature refers to heavy gold losses in tailings during dredging from 1931 to 1967 which produced a total of 2.1 mln ounces.     City Resources also said previous dredging was only carried out to a depth of 36 metres and high grade gold values are reported to at least 60 metres in the central part of the Bulolo Valley and possibly as deep as 90 metres.     In its productive life, recovered average grade at Bulolo was 0.3 rpt 0.3 grams a tonne from some 207 mln cubic metres of gravel, it said. City Resources will act as operator.     The Bulolo field, in Morobe Province, was the first successful gold mining operation of <Placer Development Ltd> after it was floated in Canada in 1926. It operated the field until dredging ceased in 1967.  REUTER 3;

19870601	SAUDI RENEGOTIATION OF ARAMCO DEAL MOVING ALONG Saudi Arabia's renegotiation of its collective agreement with Aramco to purchase oil for the latter's ex-partners is moving along and should lead to a fundamental structural change in the contract, oil industry sources said.     Petroleum Intelligence Weekly, in this Monday's edition, said negotiations are moving along for adjustment of the 1.34 mln bpd joint long term agreement at official prices and volumes and other terms may be rearranged.     The agreement signed in January for the months from February to June is up for renegotiation.     Under the January contract Aramco was to purchase 1.34 mln bpd for the four partners allocated among them as Exxon Corp <XON> 440,000 bpd, Texaco Inc <TX> 350,000 bpd, Mobil Corp <MOB> and Chevron Corp <CHV> 550,000 bpd between them.     But an overlifting by Texaco Inc in the first quarter allowed other companies like Exxon Corp to underlift its obligations under the contract     PIW said that that one alternative under consideration is to revert to four individual contracts rather than a collective agrement.     John Lichtblau, director of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation Inc said that renegotiation of the pact was more of a formality as the Saudis have each company on a separate schedule although separate agreements with the companies would favor one on one negotiations and ensure that contracted liftings occur .     "The companies will probably follow the Saudi wants within limits as they do not want to antagonize them for the long haul," he said.     Lichtblau said that the renegotiations would most likely concentrate on volume rather than price.     Saudi displeasure with the agreement has long been noted and in April industry publications said that renegotiation were being sought, a fact later confirmed by Reuters with Aramco.     Aramco Corp was formerly owned by Chevron Corp <CHV>, Exxon Corp <XON>, Mobil Corp <MOB> and Texaco Inc <TX> but is now owned by Saudi Arabia which bought its assets although the ex-partners have various agreements with Saudi Arabia.

19870601	SEOUL ANNOUNCES MORE TARIFF CUTS FOR U.S. South Korea will cut import taxes on 50 items, including construction equipment, photographic film, cigarettes and pipe tobacco, to help reduce its trade surplus with the United States, the finance ministry said.     The tariff cuts, of between five and 30 percentage points, take effect on July 1.     This brings to 157 the number of goods on which import taxes have been cut this year, a ministry official said.     The 157 are among about 290 items on which Washington has asked Seoul to lower tariffs, he added.     Today's announcement follows Saturday's removal of import curbs on 170 products. For 46 of those products, the U.S. Had had sought free access to the South Korean market.     "This is in line with the government's policy to limit our trade surplus with the United States to help reduce trade friction between the two countries," the official said.     South Korea's trade surplus with the U.S. Rose to 7.3 billion dlrs in 1986 from 4.3 billion in 1985. Officials said the surplus was expected to widen further in 1987 but Seoul would try to hold it below eight billion dlrs.     The finance ministry said tariffs would be cut later this month on a further 53 items, including acrylic yarn and ethylene, by an average 7.7 percentage points in order to check inflation.     The officials said the tariff cuts would contribute to holding wholesale and consumer price rises at less than three pct this year.  REUTER 3;

Spectra-Physics said it also filed a lawsuit in Delaware federal court this morning seeking to enjoin the offer and alleging, among other things, that the offer vilates federal securities laws, certain agreements between Ciba-Geigy and Spectra-Physics, and Ciba-Geigy's fiduciary duties.     Spectra-Physics said the two Ciba-Geigy designess to its board were not present at yesterday's special meeting which voted to reject the offer as financially inadequate, unfair and not in the best interests of Spectra-Physics or its stockholders.

19870601	TIN TRADERS' RESPONSE MUTED TO KL FUTURES MARKET European free market tin traders made a somewhat muted response to plans for a Kuala Lumpur dollar-based tin futures market due to be launched in October.     Traders said the new market would probably be a useful trading medium for Japan and other South East Asian tin interests although European traders generally appear to be reasonably satisfied with the current "free market" system which has been operating since London Metal Exchange, LME, tin trading ceased in October 1985. Dealers here will also want to see how acceptable foreign metal will be on the new market and what sort of demand develops for forward deliveries.     There is also a view among European traders that, while the proposed Kuala Lumpur tin futures market would provide another useful reference point, a market inaugurated by the Malaysian government -- in the past viewed as a major player at times by the trade -- would make participants uncomfortable.     Some traders expressed a preference for a resumption of trading on the London Metal Exchange, but they added that while there has been some behind the scenes discussion on the subject a definite move is unlikely until outstanding High Court litigation actions have been resolved.     Spot tin prices on the European free market are currently around 4,200 stg per tonne for high grade metal in warehouse Rotterdam. Over the past 18 months the price moved to a ten year low of 3,400 stg in March 1986 and rebounded to as high as 4,680 stg in December 1986.     This compares with 8,140 stg last paid when LME trading ceased in October 1985 and a record high tin price of 10,350 stg traded for Cash Standard Grade metal in June of that year.     LME warehouse stocks are now near a two-year low at 28,065 tonnes, having fallen steadily from a record high of 72,485 tonnes reached in February 1986.     Traders said the free market turned bullish during late last year based on producer forecasts of a supply/demand deficit of some 28,000/29,000 tonnes. Analysts were predicting prices of up to 5,000 stg per tonne during 1987.     However, the trend was reversed following a strong upswing in sterling versus the dollar and values fell back briefly to 4,100 stg last month after approaching 4,700 stg in December.     The decline accelerated as producers who had sold very little metal at the higher levels became competitive sellers.     There was also a lack of significant demand from major steel mills who made large purchases prior to the new year.     Traders say the 15 ITC creditor banks' original tin holdings of nearly 45,000 tonnes have now been almost halved, and the bulk of material still available is being held by Malaysian and Japanese firms which are reluctant to depress the market with unwanted metal.     Some 80,000 tonnes were held by banks and brokers after the International Tin Council's, ITC, buffer stock manager halted support operations on the LME on behalf of the 22 members nations of the International Tin Agreement.     The overhang of metal was reduced further by broker Shearson Lehman Brothers, which earlier this year reported having sold its ITC-related holdings and halved its overall tin position.     Analysts see no immediate sign of a rally in European tin prices and movements are still expected to be largely related to currency fluctuations, unless significant consumer demand emerges for the third quarter.     The Association of Tin Producing Countries, ATPC, has made efforts since the collapse of the ITA to achieve higher world prices by attempting to bring all major producers under an export control umbrella, but to date Brazil and China, two major producers, remain unaffected by the ATPC argument and apparently are continuing to offer material at discounts to consumers in main European trading centres, dealers said.

Total shut a 12-inch line that runs across the Ouachita River from Wynnewood to Ardmore with a capacity of 62,000 bpd as well as several smaller pipelines a few inches wide with capacities of several thousand bpd or less, Zollinger said.

One other small pipeline that Total also closed has a capacity of 3,000 to 4,000 bpd and crosses the Red River in Fargo, Texas, Zollinger said.

19870601	U.K. BANKERS CONSIDER NEW ECGD FINANCING PLAN Representatives of major U.K. Based banks are meeting here today to consider a new plan for reducing the cost of financing British exports guaranteed by the Export Credits Guarantee Department (ECGD), senior banking sources said.     The plan is being developed in conjunction with the ECGD and the Bank of England.     Neither the ECGD nor the Bank of England would comment on the plan. However, bankers said one of the main points under discussion is a plan to refinance the bulk of the ECGD's medium term credit portfolio in the international capital markets.      The proposals involve introducing a set of interest margins on ECGD backed debt of 5/16 to 7/8 pct, depending on the size and maturity of the credit and the currency.     The banks are likely to push for a higher margin. Bankers said that while these rates would reduce a bank's return they would still be more than those proposed about a year ago when the government attempted unsuccessfully to initiate another cost reduction plan.     At the same time, the banks would be expected to allow the ECGD to realise additional savings by refinancing existing government backed credit in the capital markets.      On credits that are refinanced an original lender would receive a residual margin of 7/16 pct for loans up to 10 mln stg and 3/16 pct on larger transactions.   REUTER 3;

19870601	U.S. STUDY SAYS TARIFFS AND QUOTAS COULD BACKFIRE The use of tariffs and quotas to reduce the flow of foreign goods into the United States will do little to cut the nation's swelling trade deficit, a government study said.     In fact, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) report said, such protectionist policies could make U.S. Products less competitive in the world marketplace by raising the cost of imported products that are re-exported in different forms.     "Such policies are much more likely to hurt, rather than help, the productive capabilities of the U.S. Economy," it said.     The 218-page report, written by FTC economists John Hilke and Philip Nelson, blamed the rising trade shortfall, which climbed to a record 166.3 billion dlrs last year, on shifting currency exchange rates and growing U.S consumer demand.     Other factors commonly blamed for the deficit, such as foreign trade practices, deteriorating U.S. Industrial competitiveness, high labour costs and government restrictions on mergers, added little to the problem, it said.     "Although each industry's competitiveness affects the level of imports and exports in that industry, in general we find that there have been no significant industry-specific changes affecting competitiveness that would explain the increase in the overall trade deficit," the study said.     "To the extent any government action is needed to deal with the trade deficits, policies should focus on economy-wide phenomena such as exchange rates and relative economic growth," the FTC study said.     Supporting its conclusion that broad-based economic shifts were the cause of the increase in the trade deficit, the report said it found that nearly all U.S. Industries lost some domestic market share to foreign competitors in the 1980s.     It also said it found a "fairly direct relationship" between the increased trade deficit and the influence of shifting currency exchange rates, U.S. Economic growth and domestic demand for goods and services, which has outpaced foreign consumer demand.     The study examined seven factors which have been commonly blamed for the trade deficit: foreign government subsidies and trade barriers to protect foreign industries, a lack of investment in U.S. Industry, declining research and development in U.S. Industry, high labour costs, union work rules, the oil prices rises of the 1970s and U.S. Antitrust regulations.     In each case, the study found little or no evidence that the factor had any impact on the trade deficit.  REUTER 3;
19870601	U.S. TRADE BILL VERY DANGEROUS FOR CANADA, LOBBY A trade bill before the United States House of Representatives "is a very dangerous bill for Canadian industry," Canadian Forest Industry Council chairman Adam Zimmerman told reporters.     By changing the definition of subsidy under U.S. countervailing duty law, House of Representatives Bill 3 removes protection for companies that take advantage of widely used government programs, Zimmerman told a media briefing.     "Clearly, any industry to which Canadian governments grant rights to fish, mine, cut timber, or produce power could be vulnerable to a finding of a subsidy under this language," he said.     The Canadian forest lobby's Zimmerman also said the House of Representative Bill would adopt a new way of measuring subsidies that would greatly increase the size of any countervailing duties that might be imposed on Canadian resource exports to the U.S.     Under the bill, any difference between Canadian prices and U.S. or world market prices would constitute a subsidy, he said. Such a method would make Canadian resource industries vulnerable to similar penalties like a 15 pct export tax imposed last January on shipments of Canadian softwood lumber to the U.S., Zimmerman added.     Canadian negotiators agreed to levy the new tax if a U.S. forest industry lobby would drop its request for a countervail duty on imports of Canadian softwood lumber.     "We represent the first victim of the move to price other countries' natural resources according to the U.S. system," Zimmerman said.     "If we're an example, than other resource industries had better watch out," he added.

"The trade data will be a deciding factor to see if the dollar has bottomed out," said Jim McGroarty of Discount Corp.     Since February 1985, the dollar has nearly halved its value against the yen and the mark as part of an officially orchestrated campaign to make U.S. goods more competitive on world markets and redress gaping world trade imbalances.     On April 27, the dollar fell to a 40-year low of 137.25 yen but has enjoyed a modest recovery over the last few weeks, topping 145 yen today for the first time in nearly two months.     Many economists now believe that the dollar has fallen far enough to ease the trade deficit's drag on the U.S. economy.     The U.S. trade gap narrowed to 13.6 billion dlrs in March from 15.1 billion in February and is expected to show continued improvement in April in volume, if not in real, terms.     Keiichi Udagawa of Bank of Tokyo in New York said that if further progress is reported, the dollar would head back up towards 150 yen.     "There is growing consensus that the dollar has bottomed out for the medium term," added Tom Campbell of First National Bank of Chicago.     Other factors supporting this bullish view were growing expectations that Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker would be reappointed for a third four-year term in August, Japan's larger-than-expected economic stimulus package last week and  more favorably technical chart signals, analysts said.     The dollar was also aided by Japan's moves to dampen speculative selling in Tokyo and by reports of active central bank intervention to support the dollar.     The Federal Reserve Bank of New York said last week that the U.S. monetary authorities bought more than four billion dlrs during the February-April period -- the largest amount since the dollar crisis of the late 1970's.     Discount Corp's McGroarty described the Fed's intervention volume as "impressive".     James O'Neill of Marine Midland Bank was not so positive, however: "the dollar has not yet bottomed out. After the trade data are released, the dollar could fall towards 1.77 marks and 140 yen."     Similarly, Natsuo Okada of Sumitomo Bank in New York warned, "I don't think the dollar has bottomed out yet."     Although the dollar could rise as high as 146.50 yen, Okada said market impatience about the painstakingly slow decline of the U.S. trade deficit may lead to renewed pressure.     Currency analysts also warned about an unfavorable reaction to the seven-nation economic Summit on June 8 to 10 in Venice, which is likely to focus on the implementation of previous commitments rather than yield any fresh initiatives.     President Reagan said today, "economic policy decisions made last year in Tokyo and at this year's meetings of Group of Seven finance ministers in Paris and Washington cannot be ignored or forgotten."     "The commitments made at these meetings need to be translated into action," he added in a speech, celebrating the 40th anniversary of the Marshall aid plan for Europe.     Now that Tokyo has unveiled its fiscal stimulus package, analysts expected Bonn and the dollar/mark rate to bear the brunt of U.S. calls for further action.     Marine Midland's O'Neill said, "pressure will build up on Germany to take stimulative action like Japan."     Some Japanese bank dealers warned that although the dollar could hold above 145 yen for some months it could also come under attack again if it seems the latest economic package is not having much impact on Japan's economy and its trade surplus. Reflecting a longer-term uncertainty, some some trust banks and Japanese insurers are keeping their short dollar positons hedged against exchange losses in their foreign portfolios, while some others have started covering those short positions, Japanese bank dealers said.

19870601	USPCI <UPC> SEEN REJECTING UNION PACIFIC BID share bid made last Wednesday by Union Pacific Corp (UNP),  analysts said.     "The offer is inadequate," said Douglas Augenthaler, an analyst with E.F. Hutton, noting that it does not represent the needed premium over the company's fundamental value based on earnings estimates.     USPCI, which has 8.7 mln shares outstanding, was trading at 48-1/8, down 3/8.     USPCI vice president of finance Larry Shelton said he could not comment on the adequacy of the offer or on when the board would meet to consider it.     Augenthaler said that while USPCI was trading at only 34 dlrs a share at the time of the takeover bid, its announcement that same day of higher earnings expectations changed its value. USPCI said its second quarter earnings would exceed analysts expectations of 24 to 30 cts a share.     At that price, USPCI could maintain a stock price in the low 40s, Augenthaler said.     Hutton revised its 1987 earnings estimate for the waste management concern to 1.40 dlrs a share from 1.20 dlrs on the announcment, he said. It lifted its 1988 projection to 1.90 dlrs a share from 1.70 dlrs.     In addition, analysts said the hazardous waste management business holds significant growth potential. The industry has grown from 16 to 35 pct over the last five years, based on earnings per share, said Jeffrey Klein, an analyst with Kidder Peabody and Co. The industry is expected to continue growing at 15 to 35 pct over the next five years, he said.     Augenthaler said the 43-dlr-a-share offer, or 375 mln dlrs total, would be a bargain for Union Pacific. The transportation and energy company would both gain entry into a profitable business and win cost-control benefits, he said.     "Union Pacific has what are rumored to be some fairly signficant environmmental problems of its own," he said.     Herb Mee Jr., president of Beard Oil Co (BEC), which holds a 30.4 pct stake in USPCI, said last week Union Pacific's offer was "grossly inadequate."  Reuter 3;
19870601	VENEZUELA GETS 300 MLN DLRS CREDIT FOR ALUMINUM Venezuela has obtained more than 300 mln dlrs in financing for industrial projects and increased its lines of credit for import financing, finance minister Manuel Azpurua said.     'We can say that we are achieving the recuperation of credit, but that cannot be done overnight,' Azpurua said in a television interview.     He said a credit agreement for 100 mln marks will be signed this week with the German state bank Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau (KFW), to finance an expansion of the state aluminum company Venalum.     The credit will be divided into two separate agreements, one for 85 mln marks with an interest rate of 6.13 pct, and another for 15 mln marks, at 6.20 pct.     Azpurua said financing has also been obtained for expansion of Alcasa, another state aluminum company, and for projects in the state steel and petrochemical industries.     Yesterday, he said Venezuela obtained two new credits of 5.0 mln dlrs each for export financing, one from Credit du Nord of France and the other from Britain's Midland Bank.     The Venezuelan government has been criticised at home for failing to obtain new credits, despite its insistence on repaying foreign debt according to the terms of a rescheduling accord reached last February.     Azpurua recently visited Tokyo hoping to acquire new credits for industrial expansions but clinched no agreements. Japanese officials refused to allow a new issue of Venezuelan bonds until the country regains its 'Triple A' credit rating.  Reuter 3;
19870601	VENEZUELA HAS NO PLANS TO SEEK REVISED DEBT ACCORD Venezuela has no plans to try to renegotiate the debt rescheduling agreement it worked out with creditor banks in February, public finance director Jorge Marcano told Reuters.     Speaking here after a meeting of the 11-nation Cartagena group, Marcano said he was aware of political pressure at home to reduce debt payments but did not think such a move would benefit Venezuela.     "We have no intention of revising the terms of the accord," he said. "There would be little to gain and in fact it would probably be detrimental."     Venezuela agreed with its bank advisory committee on a 14.5 year rescheduling of 20.3 billion dlrs in public sector foreign debt, with an interest rate 7/8 pct over Libor. The previous agreement, reached a year before but never implemented, was for 12-1/2 years with a 1-1/8 pct spread.     In Caracas there have recently been calls to invoke the agreement's contingency clause which the government used last year to amend the original terms after a 40 pct drop in oil income.     But Marcano said the bulk of payments to be made this year are on private debts and non-rescheduled public debts.     Marcano said Venezuela, which has reduced its debt by six billion dlrs since 1983, should have no problems in repaying restructured debt this year or next.     Asked whether the government felt badly treated with its 7/8 pct spread when Mexico and Argentina have won a 13/16 pct margin, Marcano said he still felt Venezuela had a good deal.     "Venezuela has restructured its debt so that most of it is being repaid at 7/8 pct, which I think is better than the other countries," he said. The rescheduling accord covers some 90 pct of Venezuela's commercial bank debt, which accounts for more than 90 pct of the total public sector external debt.     Venezuela has almost no debt outstanding to multilateral agencies.     Marcano said attempting to revise the rescheduling accord a second time would probably hurt Venezuela's bid to restore it credit rating and raise new loans.     He said Venezuela now obtains trade credit lines without a government guarantee, something that Argentina and others are just starting to try to negotiate in their restructuring packages.     Venezuela is currently seeking loans in Japan and West Germany to finance steel and aluminium expansion.     According to finance minister Manuel Azpurua, a 100 mln mark credit has been lined up for the Venalum aluminium plant.     Marcano said no mandate has yet been given for a planned 100 mln dlr bond issue, although he confirmed that talks were continuing with Morgan Guaranty and other banks.     Banking sources said one option was to privately place the bonds through the Caracas-based Banco de Venezuela, which would underwrite the issue, but Marcano said no decision has yet been made.

The finance minister's statements came as the government is under sharp criticism for failing to obtain new credits, despite its insistence on repaying the foreign debt according to the terms of a rescheduling accord reached last february.     Azpurua and other senior economic officals returned from a trip to tokyo last week in which they hoped to acquire new credits for industrial expansions, but no agreements were reached.     Japanese officials also refused to allow a new issue of venezuelan debt bonds because until the country regains its 'triple a' credit classification.  Reuter 3;
19870601	VENEZUELA TIGHTENS FOREIGN EXCHANGE RESTRICTIONS Venezuela's central bank has ordered Venezuelan banks and exchange houses to cease foreign exchange operations with brokers based outside the country, according to a copy of a central bank telex made available to Reuters.     The measure, confirmed by a brokerage firm here, has effectively cut off all foreign participation in Venezuela's volatile currency market.     The telex, issued on May 19, was signed by Carlos Hernandez Delfino, manager of the bank's department of international operations.     The telex said the restriction on business with foreign brokers is in line with an earlier measure prohibiting foreign exchange houses from selling dollars or other foreign currencies to anyone living outside Venezuela.     In recent weeks the Venezuelan government has denied rumours that it intends to impose foreign exchange controls to prop up the weakening bolivar.     But brokers said the central bank's move is seen as a de facto currency control. "It is definitely a control in the sense that there's no longer complete freedom to operate," one broker here said.     "Gradually they're imposing restrictions and the direction is towards complete control," the broker said.     The broker, who requested anonymity, said virtually all his Venezuelan customers had stopped doing business with him since the central bank issued the telex and followed it up with telephone calls.     He said that before the restriction was imposed the volume of his firm's transactions with Venezuela was about 10 mln dlrs a day. "It was a frenetic market, it was really quite active," he said.     The broker said he saw no logical explanation for the prohibition because his firm only acted act as an intermediary between Venezuelan brokers, exchange houses and banks.     "We weren't buying dollars from Venezuelans, that's ridiculous," he said. "They've been on a rampage against foreigners."     The broker noted that two months ago Venezuela's central bank quietly announced that banks doing foreign exchange business outside Venezuela would have to respect a new 200 pct reserve requirement.     In February, the central bank also prohibited trading in bolivar futures, the broker said.     "We used to have a forward market," he said. "For a small currency it was miraculous."     He said the bolivar, which averaged 20.29 to the U.S. Dollar in 1986, would continue to slip from its current range of 28.35 to 28.50 because the central bank was rapidly running out of foreign reserves to support the currency on the free market.

19870601	WINDOW FOR BANK AID IN KUWAIT REMAINS SHUT The Kuwait Central Bank kept its window for funds to the domestic interbank deposit market shut as banks returned from a four day holiday, dealers said.     The move drove short-term interest rates sharply higher, with overnight and tomorrow-next funds more than doubling from last Wednesday and hitting 20 pct.     There were few offers in a tight market and traders scrambled for any available funds. One-month to one-year deposits were indicated one point higher at eight, seven pct but there was little activity at the longer end of the market.     Bankers see the suspension of central bank aid as a deliberate move to drive up Kuwaiti dinar interest rates and stem a flow of funds out of the country, where market nervousness is increasing over the growing tension in the Gulf.     The central bank's move has been combined with a steady cut in the dinar exchange rate.     Today's rate was reduced to 0.27939/73 to the dollar from 0.27758/92 on Wednesday before the four day bank holiday that celebrated the end of the fasting month of Ramadan.  REUTER 3;
19870601	ZAMBIA CUTS PRICES AS TROOPS PATROL COPPERBELT The Zambian government today announced minor price cuts for essential commodities as part of its new economic strategy, while police and troops patrolled the northern Copperbelt to prevent any outbreaks of rioting.     However, staple foods, such as bread, sugar and maize meal, were not affected by the cuts and many people said this could provoke trouble from disgruntled elements who had expected more sweeping reductions.     Observers in the capital expressed disillusionment with the small extent of the price cuts, which ranged up to 10 pct on items such as blankets, soap, detergents and baby food.     Residents in the Copperbelt contacted by telephone said government forces had set up roadblocks around the main towns.     In Lusaka, business went on as usual and there was no sign of troops or police reinforcements on the streets.     President Kaunda had ordered the price reductions to take account of lower import costs following the revaluation of the kwacha to a fixed rate of eight per dlr from 21 on May 1.     The revaluation formed part of a new go-it-alone economic strategy which Kaunda adopted to replace Zambia's IMF austerity program.     Labour leaders in the Copperbelt said last week gangs of unemployed youths were being formed in the politically volatile region to take action against shops that did not reduce their prices after today's deadline. Fifteen people were killed in the Copperbelt during food riots last December after the government tried to lift maize subsidies.  Reuter 3;
19870602	KUWAIT REJECTS IRANIAN SPY BOAT CHARGES Kuwait, a target of Iranian anger over the emirate's backing for Iraq in the Gulf war, today rejected charges that fishing vessels seized recently by Iran were spy boats.     "There are no bases of truth to the contents of the Iranian accusation on the nature of the operations of the vessels recently taken into custody by Iran. These vessels were out fishing," the Foreign Ministry said in a statement.     It said Iranian Charge d'Affaires Mohammad Baqeri was summoned by the Ministry yesterday to confer with Foreign Undersecretary Suleiman Majed al-Shaheen.     The Iranian News Agency IRNA said on Sunday Iran had seized seven Kuwaiti speed boats and detained their crew, who confessed to spying for Iraq under the cover of fishing.     It said the boats were intercepted in the Khur Abdullah waterway which separates Kuwait and Iraq's Faw peninsula at the head of the Gulf, captured by Iran last year.     The Kuwaiti response came as Iranian envoys toured Gulf Arab states saying responsibility for security and stability in the waterway was a regional matter. A U.S. Senate team was scheduled today to meet Kuwait's Crown Prince and Prime Minister Sheikh Saad al-Abdulla al-Sabah and the defence and oil ministers.     Today's Foreign Ministry statement, carried by the Kuwait News Agency KUNA, said the recent detention of Kuwaiti fishing vessels by Iran was not the first.     Tehran in the past had held back a number of vessels Kuwait had sought to release through diplomatic contacts, it said.     "However, Kuwait is perplexed that this time the Iranian charges are accompanied by accusations that the vessels were undertaking espionage activities," it said.     Shaheen condemned the detentions and accusations, and asked Tehran to free all fishing boats and sailors held by Iran, the statement said.  REUTER 3;
19870602	LAWSON CALLS INTERVENTION PROOF OF STABILITY GOAL The scale of foreign exchange intervention the Bank of England has carried out recently is clear proof of Britain's determination to stabilise exchange rates as agreed between the Group of Seven industrialised countries in Paris in February, Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson said.     Saying he was "content" with sterling's current value, Lawson told reporters he wanted "to maintain the exchange rate stability we have all signed up for." He declined to say if he favoured a rise or a fall from present sterling levels.  May currency reserves, out today, showed a record 4.8 billion stg rise, pointing to massive currency intervention.     In April, reserves rose a hefty 2.9 billion stg.     Pointing to the reserves data, Lawson said, "We have been playing a very full part ourselves" in meeting our commitments toward exchange rate stability as agreed in Paris.     "We wish to see it (stability) continuing," he added.     Asked which techniques were available to preserve stability, Lawson said both central bank intervention and interest rate changes could be used to tackle "the market pressures there are from time to time."     "Interest rate stability is not an objective in that sense...Rates have to be moved up and down at times," he added.     Lawson said he expected intervention to be "sterilised" by draining excess sterling liquidity from the market through new issues of government securities and foreign currency sales, when the market allowed.     This would limit the inflationary impact of intervention, he said.     "Sterilisation will be dictated by market tactics...Not necessarily in the month in which intervention occurs," Lawson said. "I am confident that we can sterilise on this scale."  REUTER 3;
19870602	LAWSON SAYS LOUVRE CURRENCY ACCORD SATISFACTORY The Louvre agreement by the Group of Seven finance ministers and central bankers to stabilise currencies has worked well and needs no fundamental strengthening at the economic summit in Venice on June 8-10, U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson said.     Previewing the summit, which he expected would not produce any major new economic initiatives, Lawson told reporters work remained to be done on improving the conditions for lasting world economic growth.5;30;side measures to boost growth, he said.      "I think it is possible that there may be scope for a further reduction in interest rates in Germany," he added, but stressed that he had had no indication that such a move was likely. He made no mention of Japanese interest rates.     Lawson said the U.S. Should embark on "a gradual reduction of its fiscal deficits over the next two or three years."     He said the February 22 Louvre accord had produced "satisfactory exchange rate stability," in part thanks to heavy coordinated intervention of Group of Seven central banks, and he was "content" with sterling's exchange rate.     Pointing to the record 4.8 billion stg rise in U.K. May currency reserves announced today he said, "we have been playing a very full part ourselves ... We have been intervening to a very much greater extent than we had done hitherto."     Lawson said there was a risk that the Louvre agreement may falter if member states did not implement the macro-economic commitments underlying the accord.     "Certainly it would be more difficult to maintain exchange rate stability if countries are seen not to implement their commitments in Paris ... In this respect." He said the U.S. Budget deficit was "very important."     Noting the 6,000 billion yen economic package announced by Japanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone last week Lawson said, "what is really needed in Japan is an increase in merchandise imports. Supply side measures are critical."     "There is a specific range of consumer and agricultural goods where they have an extremely restrictive regime which is wholly unjustified," he said.     Lawson doubted that Tokyo's partners would indulge in "Japan bashing" at the summit especially after the economic stimulation package and the announcement of Nakasone's plans to increase Japanese development aid over the next three years.     Japan's more flexible stance on Tokyo stock exchange membership would also help deflect criticism, he said.     He said he thought West Germany would instead come under pressure at the summit to adopt similar stimulation measures to jack up faltering economic growth.     In this respect Lawson said he hoped Bonn would bring forward to January 1988 part of its agreed package of tax cuts scheduled for 1990. He also called on Bonn to push ahead with the privatisation of German national industries.     On debt, Lawson said he expected a three point British plan to alleviate the burden of the poorest sub-saharan countries to make progress in Venice.     The plan, involving concessional rescheduling of sovereign debt in the Paris Club, was first proposed at the IMF and World Bank meetings in Washington earlier this year.     Lawson said he would seek "to consolidate political backing for the plan at the Venice summit" and hoped the programme would be finalised at the Autumn meetings of the IMF and World Bank.     He welcomed the recent moves by Citicorp and Chase Manhattan to increase sharply their Third World debt provisions.     "First, it is a blow for realism. Second, because the market response has shown that banks have much less to fear from this sort of move than they felt before Citicorp," he said.     U.K. Banks should follow Bank of England recommendations, strengthening their balance sheets and making more provisions. "They have done it to some extent, they need to do it more," Lawson said, adding it was up to the banks themselves to determine the appropriate size of provisions.     He also said the dismantling of farm subsidies would be discussed at the summit. "There is a consensus, which we have to push further."  REUTER 3;
19870602	U.K. RESERVES LIFT HOPES OF FURTHER BASE RATE CUT The record 4.9 billion dlrs rise in U.K. Reserves in May to a total 34.7 billion has lifted hopes for a further cut in bank base lending rates after the June 11 general election, market analysts said.     Sterling would have risen on the much better than expected number but for market nerves about the poll outcome, they said.     But the weight of foreign currency and gold reserves now available to the authorities to support the pound should curb any market tendency to panic if U.K. Opinion polls show the ruling Conservative Party's lead slipping, they added.     "We have been intervening to a very much greater extent than we have done hitherto," Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson said at a news conference today, commenting on the news of the record reserves rise.     He put the U.K. Intervention in the context of the Louvre accord between leading industrial nations to stabilise the dollar, partly through direct intervention on foreign exchanges. "We have been playing a very full part ourselves," he said.     But market analysts see the recent upward pressure on sterling, and consequent need for official sales to damp down its rise, more in the light of local factors.     Steven Bell, chief economist at Morgan Grenfell Securities, said that corporate money has been flowing back into Britain amid hopes of another Conservative government, after fears last autumn of a Labour election victory sent it flooding out.     U.K. Portfolio investment is also returning, while foreign buyers see U.K. Growth propects and high bond yields as attractive. They will be strong buyers of U.K. Assets, notably equities, once the election is out of the way, Bell said.     Analysts see this pressure as the main hope for lower interest rates, as the government is expected to try to reverse the loss of export competitiveness caused by a strong pound.     Today, however, the pound hardly moved on the reserves news, dipping on its trade-weighted index against a basket of currencies from 73.1 pct of its 1975 value at 1000 GMT to 73.0 pct at 1100 GMT, half an hour after the figures were released.     "The market doesn't want to do anything because of the election," commented an economist at a big U.S. Investment bank.     Several dealers and analysts added that market forecasts of a rise in reserves of between one and three billion dlrs had overestimated the amount of pound sales that were likely to have been disguised by swap arrangements or transactions on the forward market.     The market also seemed to have overestimated the amount of sterling the Bank of England bought at the end of May to smooth the pound's sudden downturn, while some of the intervention reported in May probably occurred in April, they said.     The key three months interbank money market rates eased about 1/8 point, reflecting cautious hopes that the downtrend in U.K. Interest rates will be revived following the reserves news, analysts said.     Government bond prices initially firmed, but the market was muted as traders worried about the funding implications of another huge rise in reserves, they added.     Morgan Grenfell's Bell forecast a half point base rate cut from the current nine pct level soon after the election, so long as poll projections of another Conservative victory prove accurate, with another half point later.     Justin Silverton, equity economist at Credit Suisse Buckmaster and Moore, said a full point reduction might be possible. "Sterling will be held down by interest rate cuts in future, rather than this active intervention," he predicted.     Kevin Boakes of Greenwell Montagu Gilt-Edged cautioned against over-optimistic forecasts, but agreed a half point cut looked likely.     A cut before the election has been virtually ruled out.     "The Bank (of England) is both worried about the political problem of cutting rates during an election campaign ... And has signalled some worry about broad money (growth)," said Robin Marshall, chief U.K. Economist at Chase Manhattan Securities.     He said the 10 billion dlrs increase in total reserves in the past seven months may foreshadow full U.K. Entry into the European Monetary System.     But Bell said the authorities would like to see another 10 or 15 billion dlrs in the reserves before joining, if they did so. But, unlike many analysts, he doubted the U.K. Will go in.  REUTER 3;
19870602	U.K. RESERVES SHOW RECORD UNDERLYING RISE IN MAY Britain's gold and currency reserves rose a record underlying 4.76 billion dlrs in May, following April's 2.9 billion dlrs increase, the Treasury said.     The underlying trend indicates the level of recent Bank of England intervention on currency markets to curb sterling's strength. It was above market expectations which had been for a rise of between one billion and three billion dlrs.     The Treasury declined comment on the figures.     Actual reserves rose 4.87 billion dlrs in May, compared with April's 2.8 billion increase, to a total value of 34.68 billion dlrs, compared with 29.81 billion at the end of April.     Borrowings under the exchange cover scheme were 238 mln dlrs, against April's 66 mln. Repayments under the scheme were 85 mln dlrs, after 90 mln previously, with capital repayments of eight mln, after three mln last month.     Repayments of government debt amounted to 33 mln dlrs.     The underlying reserves increase is net of borrowings and repayments.     It was larger than the previous record 3.04 billion dlrs rise seen in October 1977. The May increase represents the seventh monthly rise, with reserves up 9.947 billion dlrs in that period, and up 9.816 billion since the start of 1987.  REUTER 3;
