/**
 * An iterator that locates ISO 15924 script boundaries in text.
 *
 * <p>This is not the same as simply looking at the Unicode block, or even the Script property. Some
 * characters are 'common' across multiple scripts, and some 'inherit' the script value of text
 * surrounding them.
 *
 * <p>This is similar to ICU (internal-only) UScriptRun, with the following differences:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Doesn't attempt to match paired punctuation. For tokenization purposes, this is not
 *       necessary. It's also quite expensive.
 *   <li>Non-spacing marks inherit the script of their base character, following recommendations
 *       from UTR #24.
