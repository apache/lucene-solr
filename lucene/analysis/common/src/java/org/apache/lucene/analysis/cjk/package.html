Analyzer for Chinese, Japanese, and Korean, which indexes bigrams. 
This analyzer generates bigram terms, which are overlapping groups of two adjacent Han, Hiragana, Katakana, or Hangul characters.
<p>
Three analyzers are provided for Chinese, each of which treats Chinese text in a different way.
<ul>
	<li>ChineseAnalyzer (in the analyzers/cn package): Index unigrams (individual Chinese characters) as a token.
	<li>CJKAnalyzer (in this package): Index bigrams (overlapping groups of two adjacent Chinese characters) as tokens.
	<li>SmartChineseAnalyzer (in the analyzers/smartcn package): Index words (attempt to segment Chinese text into words) as tokens.
</ul>

Example phrase： "我是中国人"
<ol>
	<li>ChineseAnalyzer: 我－是－中－国－人</li>
	<li>CJKAnalyzer: 我是－是中－中国－国人</li>
	<li>SmartChineseAnalyzer: 我－是－中国－人</li>
</ol>
