    <title>Apache Lucene Analyzers</title>
  </head>
  <body>
  Analyzers for indexing content in different languages and domains.
    <p>
    For an introduction to Lucene's analysis API, see the {@link org.apache.lucene.analysis} package documentation.
    </p>
    <p>
    This module contains concrete components ({@link org.apache.lucene.analysis.CharFilter}s,
    {@link org.apache.lucene.analysis.Tokenizer}s, and ({@link org.apache.lucene.analysis.TokenFilter}s) for 
    analyzing different types of content. It also provides a number of {@link org.apache.lucene.analysis.Analyzer}s
    for different languages that you can use to get started quickly. To define fully custom Analyzers
    (like in the index schema of Apache Solr), this module provides {@link org.apache.lucene.analysis.custom.CustomAnalyzer}.
