 * are then applied by supplying (x,y,z) tuples.  It is also
 * possible to indicate the following edge cases:
 * (1) No longitude bound possible
 * (2) No upper latitude bound possible
 * (3) No lower latitude bound possible
 * When any of these have been applied, further application of
 * points cannot override that decision.
