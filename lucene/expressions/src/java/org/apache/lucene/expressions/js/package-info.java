/**
 * Javascript expressions.
 *
 * <p>A Javascript expression is a numeric expression specified using an expression syntax that's
 * based on JavaScript expressions. You can construct expressions using:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Integer, floating point, hex and octal literals
 *   <li>Arithmetic operators: <code>+ - * / %</code>
 *   <li>Bitwise operators: <code>| &amp; ^ ~ &lt;&lt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;</code>
 *   <li>Boolean operators (including the ternary operator): <code>&amp;&amp; || ! ?:</code>
 *   <li>Comparison operators: <code>&lt; &lt;= == &gt;= &gt;</code>
 *   <li>Common mathematic functions: <code>abs ceil exp floor ln log10 logn max min sqrt pow</code>
 *   <li>Trigonometric library functions: <code>
 *       acosh acos asinh asin atanh atan atan2 cosh cos sinh sin tanh tan</code>
 *   <li>Distance functions: <code>haversin</code>
 *   <li>Miscellaneous functions: <code>min, max</code>
 *   <li>Arbitrary external variables - see {@link org.apache.lucene.expressions.Bindings}
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>JavaScript order of precedence rules apply for operators. Shortcut evaluation is used for
 * logical operatorsâ€”the second argument is only evaluated if the value of the expression cannot be
 * determined after evaluating the first argument. For example, in the expression <code>a || b
 * </code>, <code>b</code> is only evaluated if a is not true.
 *
 * <p>To compile an expression, use {@link org.apache.lucene.expressions.js.JavascriptCompiler}.
