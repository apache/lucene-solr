    <title>Apache Lucene Expressions Module</title>
  </head>
  <body>

  <h1>The Expressions Module for Apache Lucene</h1>

  <p>
    The expressions module is new to Lucene 4.6. It provides an API for dynamically computing per-document values based on string expressions.
  </p>
  <p>
    The module is organized in two sections:
    <ol>
      <li>{@link org.apache.lucene.expressions} - The abstractions and simple utilities for common operations like sorting on an expression</li>
      <li>{@link org.apache.lucene.expressions.js} - A compiler for a subset of JavaScript expressions</li>
    </ol>
  <p>
    For sample code showing how to use the API, see {@link org.apache.lucene.expressions.Expression}.
