# Apache Lucene Migration Guide

## Similarity.SimScorer.computeXXXFactor methods removed (LUCENE-8014) ##

SpanQuery and PhraseQuery now always calculate their slops as (1.0 / (1.0 +
distance)).  Payload factor calculation is performed by PayloadDecoder in the
queries module


## Scorer must produce positive scores (LUCENE-7996) ##

Scorers are no longer allowed to produce negative scores. If you have custom
query implementations, you should make sure their score formula may never produce
negative scores.

As a side-effect of this change, negative boosts are now rejected and
FunctionScoreQuery maps negative values to 0.


## CustomScoreQuery, BoostedQuery and BoostingQuery removed (LUCENE-8099) ##

Instead use FunctionScoreQuery and a DoubleValuesSource implementation.  BoostedQuery
and BoostingQuery may be replaced by calls to FunctionScoreQuery.boostByValue() and
FunctionScoreQuery.boostByQuery().  To replace more complex calculations in
CustomScoreQuery, use the lucene-expressions module:

SimpleBindings bindings = new SimpleBindings();
bindings.add("score", DoubleValuesSource.SCORES);
bindings.add("boost1", DoubleValuesSource.fromIntField("myboostfield"));
bindings.add("boost2", DoubleValuesSource.fromIntField("myotherboostfield"));
Expression expr = JavascriptCompiler.compile("score * (boost1 + ln(boost2))");
FunctionScoreQuery q = new FunctionScoreQuery(inputQuery, expr.getDoubleValuesSource(bindings));

## Index options can no longer be changed dynamically (LUCENE-8134) ##

Changing index options on the fly is now going to result into an
IllegalArgumentException. If a field is indexed
(FieldType.indexOptions() != IndexOptions.NONE) then all documents must have
the same index options for that field.


## IndexSearcher.createNormalizedWeight() removed (LUCENE-8242) ##

Instead use IndexSearcher.createWeight(), rewriting the query first, and using
a boost of 1f.

## Memory codecs removed (LUCENE-8267) ##

Memory codecs have been removed from the codebase (MemoryPostings, MemoryDocValues).

## QueryCachingPolicy.ALWAYS_CACHE removed (LUCENE-8144) ##

Caching everything is discouraged as it disables the ability to skip non-interesting documents.
ALWAYS_CACHE can be replaced by a UsageTrackingQueryCachingPolicy with an appropriate config.

## English stopwords are no longer removed by default in StandardAnalyzer (LUCENE_7444) ##

To retain the old behaviour, pass StandardAnalyzer.ENGLISH_STOP_WORDS_SET as an argument
to the constructor

## StandardAnalyzer.ENGLISH_STOP_WORD_SET has been moved ##

English stop words are now defined in EnglishAnalyzer#ENGLISH_STOP_WORD_SET in the
analysis-common module

## TopDocs.maxScore removed ##

TopDocs.maxScore is removed. IndexSearcher and TopFieldCollector no longer have
an option to compute the maximum score when sorting by field. If you need to
know the maximum score for a query, the recommended approach is to run a
separate query:

  TopDocs topHits = searcher.search(query, 1);
  float maxScore = topHits.scoreDocs.length == 0 ? Float.NaN : topHits.scoreDocs[0].score;

Thanks to other optimizations that were added to Lucene 8, this query will be
able to efficiently select the top-scoring document without having to visit
all matches.

## TopFieldCollector always assumes fillFields=true ##

Because filling sort values doesn't have a significant overhead, the fillFields
option has been removed from TopFieldCollector factory methods. Everything
behaves as if it was set to true.

## TopFieldCollector no longer takes a trackDocScores option ##

Computing scores at collection time is less efficient than running a second
request in order to only compute scores for documents that made it to the top
hits. As a consequence, the trackDocScores option has been removed and can be
replaced with the new TopFieldCollector#populateScores helper method.

## TopDocs.totalHits is no longer a long ##

Lucene 8 received optimizations for collection of top-k matches by not visiting
all matches. However these optimizations won't help if all matches still need
to be visited in order to compute the total number of hits. As a consequence,
TopDocs.totalHits is now an TotalHits object that is either an exact hit count
or a lower bound of the hit count.
