# Apache Lucene Migration Guide

## Query.hashCode and Query.equals are now abstract methods (LUCENE-7277)

Any custom query subclasses should redeclare equivalence relationship according
to the subclass's details. See code patterns used in existing core Lucene query
classes for details.

## CompressionTools removed (LUCENE-7322)

Per-field compression has been superseded by codec-level compression, which has
the benefit of being able to compress several fields, or even documents at once,
yielding better compression ratios. In case you would still like to compress on
top of the codec, you can do it on the application side by using the utility
classes from the java.util.zip package.
