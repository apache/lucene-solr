# Apache Lucene Migration Guide

## Similarity.SimScorer.computeXXXFactor methods removed (LUCENE-8014) ##

SpanQuery and PhraseQuery now always calculate their slops as (1.0 / (1.0 +
distance)).  Payload factor calculation is performed by PayloadDecoder in the
queries module


## Scorer must produce positive scores (LUCENE-7996) ##

Scorers are no longer allowed to produce negative scores. If you have custom
query implementations, you should make sure their score formula may never produce
negative scores.

As a side-effect of this change, negative boosts are now rejected and
FunctionScoreQuery maps negative values to 0.
