<h1>Misc Tools</h1>

The misc package has various tools for splitting/merging indices,
changing norms, finding high freq terms, and others.

<h2>DirectIODirectory</h2>

<p>
{@link org.apache.lucene.misc.store.DirectIODirectory} is a Directory implementation that bypasses the
OS's buffer cache (using direct IO) for any IndexInput and IndexOutput
used during merging of segments larger than a specified size (default
10 MB).  This avoids evicting hot pages that are still in-use for
searching, keeping search more responsive while large merges run.
