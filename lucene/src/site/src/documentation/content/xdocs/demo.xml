<section id="About this Document"><title>About this Document</title>
<p>
This document is intended as a "getting started" guide to using and running the Lucene demos.
It walks you through some basic installation and configuration.
</p>
</section>


<section id="About the Demo"><title>About the Demo</title>
<p>
The Lucene command-line demo code consists of an application that demonstrates various
functionalities of Lucene and how you can add Lucene to your applications.

<section id="Setting your CLASSPATH"><title>Setting your CLASSPATH</title>
<p>
First, you should <a href="http://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.cgi/lucene/java/">download</a> the
latest Lucene distribution and then extract it to a working directory.
</p>
<p>
You need three JARs: the Lucene JAR, the common analysis JAR, and the Lucene demo JAR.  You should
see the Lucene JAR file in the directory you created when you extracted the archive -- it
should be named something like <code>lucene-core-{version}.jar</code>.  You should also see files
called <code>lucene-analyzers-common-{version}.jar</code> and <code>lucene-demo-{version}.jar</code>.
</p>
<p>
Put all three of these files in your Java CLASSPATH.
</p>
</section>

<section id="Indexing Files"><title>Indexing Files</title>
<p>
Once you've gotten this far you're probably itching to go.  Let's <b>build an index!</b> Assuming
you've set your CLASSPATH correctly, just type:

<pre>
    java org.apache.lucene.demo.IndexFiles -docs {path-to-lucene}/src
</pre>

This will produce a subdirectory called <code>index</code> which will contain an index of all of the
Lucene source code.
</p>
<p>
To <b>search the index</b> type:

<pre>
    java org.apache.lucene.demo.SearchFiles
</pre>

You'll be prompted for a query.  Type in a swear word and press the enter key.  You'll see that the
Lucene developers are very well mannered and get no results. Now try entering the word "string".
That should return a whole bunch of documents.  The results will page at every tenth result and ask
you whether you want more results.
