Support for testing analysis components.
<p>
The main classes of interest are:
<ul>
   <li>{@link org.apache.lucene.analysis.BaseTokenStreamTestCase}: Highly recommended
       to use its helper methods, (especially in conjunction with 
       {@link org.apache.lucene.analysis.MockAnalyzer} or {@link org.apache.lucene.analysis.MockTokenizer}), 
       as it contains many assertions and checks to catch bugs. </li>
   <li>{@link org.apache.lucene.analysis.MockTokenizer}: Tokenizer for testing.
       Tokenizer that serves as a replacement for WHITESPACE, SIMPLE, and KEYWORD
       tokenizers. If you are writing a component such as a TokenFilter, it's a great idea to test
       it wrapping this tokenizer instead for extra checks. </li>
   <li>{@link org.apache.lucene.analysis.MockAnalyzer}: Analyzer for testing.
       Analyzer that uses MockTokenizer for additional verification. If you are testing a custom 
       component such as a queryparser or analyzer-wrapper that consumes analysis streams, it's a great 
       idea to test it with this analyzer instead. </li>
</ul>
