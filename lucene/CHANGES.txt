======================= Lucene 4.3.1 =======================

Bug Fixes

* SOLR-4813: Fix SynonymFilterFactory to allow init parameters for
  tokenizer factory used when parsing synonyms file.  (Shingo Sasaki, hossman)

* LUCENE-4935: CustomScoreQuery wrongly applied its query boost twice
  (boost^2).  (Robert Muir)

* LUCENE-4948: Fixed ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in PostingsHighlighter
  if you had a 64-bit JVM without compressed OOPS: IBM J9, or Oracle with
  large heap/explicitly disabled.  (Mike McCandless, Uwe Schindler, Robert Muir)

* LUCENE-4953: Fixed ParallelCompositeReader to inform ReaderClosedListeners of
  its synthetic subreaders. FieldCaches keyed on the atomic childs will be purged
  earlier and FC insanity prevented.  In addition, ParallelCompositeReader's
  toString() was changed to better reflect the reader structure.
  (Mike McCandless, Uwe Schindler)

* LUCENE-4968: Fixed ToParentBlockJoinQuery/Collector: correctly handle parent
  hits that had no child matches, don't throw IllegalArgumentEx when
  the child query has no hits, more aggressively catch cases where childQuery
  incorrectly matches parent documents (Mike McCandless)

* LUCENE-4970: Fix boost value of rewritten NGramPhraseQuery.
  (Shingo Sasaki via Adrien Grand)

* LUCENE-4974: CommitIndexTask was broken if no params were set. (Shai Erera)

* LUCENE-4986: Fixed case where a newly opened near-real-time reader
  fails to reflect a delete from IndexWriter.tryDeleteDocument (Reg,
  Mike McCandless)

* LUCENE-4991: Fix handling of synonyms in classic QueryParser.getFieldQuery for
  terms not separated by whitespace. PositionIncrementAttribute was ignored, so with
  default AND synonyms wrongly became mandatory clauses, and with OR, the
  coordination factor was wrong.  (李威, Robert Muir)

* LUCENE-4994: Fix PatternKeywordMarkerFilter to have public constructor.
  (Uwe Schindler)

* LUCENE-4993: Fix BeiderMorseFilter to preserve custom attributes when
  inserting tokens with position increment 0.  (Uwe Schindler)

* LUCENE-5002: IndexWriter#deleteAll() caused a deadlock in DWPT / DWSC if a
  DwPT was flushing concurrently while deleteAll() aborted all DWPT. The IW
  should never wait on DWPT via the flush control while holding on to the IW
  Lock. (Simon Willnauer)

Optimizations

* LUCENE-4938: Don't use an unnecessarily large priority queue in IndexSearcher
  methods that take top-N.  (Uwe Schindler, Mike McCandless, Robert Muir)

======================= Lucene 4.3.0 =======================

Changes in backwards compatibility policy

* LUCENE-4810: EdgeNGramTokenFilter no longer increments position for
  multiple ngrams derived from the same input token. (Walter Underwood
  via Mike McCandless)

* LUCENE-4822: KeywordTokenFilter is now an abstract class. Subclasses
  need to implement #isKeyword() in order to mark terms as keywords. 
  The existing functionality has been factored out into a new 
  SetKeywordTokenFilter class. (Simon Willnauer, Uwe Schindler)
  
* LUCENE-4642: Remove Tokenizer's and subclasses' ctors taking
  AttributeSource. (Renaud Delbru, Uwe Schindler, Steve Rowe)

* LUCENE-4833: IndexWriterConfig used to use LogByteSizeMergePolicy when
  calling setMergePolicy(null) although the default merge policy is
  TieredMergePolicy. IndexWriterConfig setters now throw an exception when
  passed null if null is not a valid value. (Adrien Grand)

* LUCENE-4849: Made ParallelTaxonomyArrays abstract with a concrete
  implementation for DirectoryTaxonomyWriter/Reader. Also moved it under
  o.a.l.facet.taxonomy. (Shai Erera)

* LUCENE-4876: IndexDeletionPolicy is now an abstract class instead of an
  interface. IndexDeletionPolicy, MergeScheduler and InfoStream now implement
  Cloneable. (Adrien Grand)

* LUCENE-4874: FilterAtomicReader and related classes (FilterTerms,
  FilterDocsEnum, ...) don't forward anymore to the filtered instance when the
  method has a default implementation through other abstract methods.
  (Adrien Grand, Robert Muir)

* LUCENE-4642, LUCENE-4877: Implementors of TokenizerFactory, TokenFilterFactory,
  and CharFilterFactory now need to provide at least one constructor taking
  Map<String,String> to be able to be loaded by the SPI framework (e.g., from Solr).
  In addition, TokenizerFactory needs to implement the abstract
  create(AttributeFactory,Reader) method.  (Renaud Delbru, Uwe Schindler,
  Steve Rowe, Robert Muir)

API Changes

* LUCENE-4896: Made PassageFormatter abstract in PostingsHighlighter, made
  members of DefaultPassageFormatter protected.  (Luca Cavanna via Robert Muir)

* LUCENE-4844: removed TaxonomyReader.getParent(), you should use
  TaxonomyReader.getParallelArrays().parents() instead. (Shai Erera)

* LUCENE-4742: Renamed spatial 'Node' to 'Cell', along with any method names
  and variables using this terminology. (David Smiley)

New Features

* LUCENE-4815: DrillSideways now allows more than one FacetRequest per
  dimension (Mike McCandless)
  
* LUCENE-3918: IndexSorter has been ported to 4.3 API and now supports
  sorting documents by a numeric DocValues field, or reverse the order of
  the documents in the index. Additionally, apps can implement their own
  sort criteria. (Anat Hashavit, Shai Erera)

* LUCENE-4817: Added KeywordRepeatFilter that allows to emit a token twice
  once as a keyword and once as an ordinary token allow stemmers to emit
  a stemmed version along with the un-stemmed version. (Simon Willnauer)

* LUCENE-4822: PatternKeywordTokenFilter can mark tokens as keywords based
  on regular expressions. (Simon Willnauer, Uwe Schindler)

* LUCENE-4821: AnalyzingSuggester now uses the ending offset to
  determine whether the last token was finished or not, so that a
  query "i " will no longer suggest "Isla de Muerta" for example.
  (Mike McCandless)
  
* LUCENE-4642: Add create(AttributeFactory) to TokenizerFactory and
  subclasses with ctors taking AttributeFactory. 
  (Renaud Delbru, Uwe Schindler, Steve Rowe)

* LUCENE-4820: Add payloads to Analyzing/FuzzySuggester, to record an
  arbitrary byte[] per suggestion (Mike McCandless)

* LUCENE-4816: Add WholeBreakIterator to PostingsHighlighter
  for treating the entire content as a single Passage.  (Robert
  Muir, Mike McCandless)

* LUCENE-4827: Add additional ctor to PostingsHighlighter PassageScorer
  to provide bm25 k1,b,avgdl parameters. (Robert Muir)

* LUCENE-4607: Add DocIDSetIterator.cost() and Spans.cost() for optimizing
  scoring.  (Simon Willnauer, Robert Muir)

* LUCENE-4795: Add SortedSetDocValuesFacetFields and
  SortedSetDocValuesAccumulator, to compute topK facet counts from a
  field's SortedSetDocValues.  This method only supports flat
  (dim/label) facets, is a bit (~25%) slower, has added cost
  per-IndexReader-open to compute its ordinal map, but it requires no
  taxonomy index and it tie-breaks facet labels in an understandable
  (by Unicode sort order) way.  (Robert Muir, Mike McCandless)
  
* LUCENE-4843: Add LimitTokenPositionFilter: don't emit tokens with 
  positions that exceed the configured limit.  (Steve Rowe)

* LUCENE-4832: Add ToParentBlockJoinCollector.getTopGroupsWithAllChildDocs, to retrieve
  all children in each group.  (Aleksey Aleev via Mike McCandless)

* LUCENE-4846: PostingsHighlighter subclasses can override where the
  String values come from (it still defaults to pulling from stored
  fields).  (Robert Muir, Mike McCandless)

* LUCENE-4853: Add PostingsHighlighter.highlightFields method that
  takes int[] docIDs instead of TopDocs.  (Robert Muir, Mike
  McCandless)

* LUCENE-4856: If there are no matches for a given field, return the
  first maxPassages sentences (Robert Muir, Mike McCandless)

* LUCENE-4859: IndexReader now exposes Terms statistics: getDocCount,
  getSumDocFreq, getSumTotalTermFreq. (Shai Erera)

* LUCENE-4862: It is now possible to terminate collection of a single
  IndexReader leaf by throwing a CollectionTerminatedException in
  Collector.collect. (Adrien Grand, Shai Erera)

* LUCENE-4752: New SortingMergePolicy (in lucene/misc) that sorts documents
  before merging segments. (Adrien Grand, Shai Erera, David Smiley)

* LUCENE-4860: Customize scoring and formatting per-field in
  PostingsHighlighter by subclassing and overriding the getFormatter
  and/or getScorer methods.  This also changes Passage.getMatchTerms()
  to return BytesRef[] instead of Term[].  (Robert Muir, Mike
  McCandless)

* LUCENE-4839: Added SorterTemplate.timSort, a O(n log n) stable sort algorithm
  that performs well on partially sorted data. (Adrien Grand)

* LUCENE-4644: Added support for the "IsWithin" spatial predicate for
  RecursivePrefixTreeStrategy. It's for matching non-point indexed shapes; if
  you only have points (1/doc) then "Intersects" is equivalent and faster.
  See the javadocs.  (David Smiley)

* LUCENE-4861: Make BreakIterator per-field in PostingsHighlighter. This means
  you can override getBreakIterator(String field) to use different mechanisms
  for e.g. title vs. body fields.  (Mike McCandless, Robert Muir)

* LUCENE-4645: Added support for the "Contains" spatial predicate for
  RecursivePrefixTreeStrategy.  (David Smiley)

* LUCENE-4898: DirectoryReader.openIfChanged now allows opening a reader
  on an IndexCommit starting from a near-real-time reader (previously
  this would throw IllegalArgumentException).  (Mike McCandless)

* LUCENE-4905: Made the maxPassages parameter per-field in PostingsHighlighter.
  (Robert Muir)

* LUCENE-4897: Added TaxonomyReader.getChildren for traversing a category's 
  children. (Shai Erera)

* LUCENE-4902: Added FilterDirectoryReader to allow easy filtering of a
  DirectoryReader's subreaders. (Alan Woodward, Adrien Grand, Uwe Schindler)

* LUCENE-4858: Added EarlyTerminatingSortingCollector to be used in conjunction
  with SortingMergePolicy, which allows to early terminate queries on sorted
  indexes, when the sort order matches the index order. (Adrien Grand, Shai Erera)

* LUCENE-4904: Added descending sort order to NumericDocValuesSorter. (Shai Erera)

* LUCENE-3786: Added SearcherTaxonomyManager, to manage access to both
  IndexSearcher and DirectoryTaxonomyReader for near-real-time
  faceting.  (Shai Erera, Mike McCandless)

* LUCENE-4915: DrillSideways now allows drilling down on fields that
  are not faceted. (Mike McCandless)

* LUCENE-4895: Added support for the "IsDisjointTo" spatial predicate for
  RecursivePrefixTreeStrategy.  (David Smiley)

* LUCENE-4774: Added FieldComparator that allows sorting parent documents based on
  fields on the child / nested document level. (Martijn van Groningen)

Optimizations

* LUCENE-4839: SorterTemplate.merge can now be overridden in order to replace
  the default implementation which merges in-place by a faster implementation
  that could require fewer swaps at the expense of some extra memory.
  ArrayUtil and CollectionUtil override it so that their mergeSort and timSort
  methods are faster but only require up to 1% of extra memory. (Adrien Grand)

* LUCENE-4571: Speed up BooleanQuerys with minNrShouldMatch to use
  skipping.  (Stefan Pohl via Robert Muir)

* LUCENE-4863: StemmerOverrideFilter now uses a FST to represent its overrides
  in memory. (Simon Willnauer)

* LUCENE-4889: UnicodeUtil.codePointCount implementation replaced with a
  non-array-lookup version. (Dawid Weiss)

* LUCENE-4923: Speed up BooleanQuerys processing of in-order disjunctions.
  (Robert Muir)

* LUCENE-4926: Speed up DisjunctionMatchQuery.  (Robert Muir)

* LUCENE-4930: Reduce contention in older/buggy JVMs when using
  AttributeSource#addAttribute() because java.lang.ref.ReferenceQueue#poll()
  is implemented using synchronization.  (Christian Ziech, Karl Wright,
  Uwe Schindler)

Bug Fixes

* LUCENE-4868: SumScoreFacetsAggregator used an incorrect index into
  the scores array. (Shai Erera)

* LUCENE-4882: FacetsAccumulator did not allow to count ROOT category (i.e.
  count dimensions). (Shai Erera)

* LUCENE-4876: IndexWriterConfig.clone() now clones its MergeScheduler,
  IndexDeletionPolicy and InfoStream in order to make an IndexWriterConfig and
  its clone fully independent. (Adrien Grand)

* LUCENE-4893: Facet counts were multiplied as many times as 
  FacetsCollector.getFacetResults() is called. (Shai Erera)

* LUCENE-4888: Fixed SloppyPhraseScorer, MultiDocs(AndPositions)Enum and
  MultiSpansWrapper which happened to sometimes call DocIdSetIterator.advance
  with target<=current (in this case the behavior of advance is undefined).
  (Adrien Grand)

* LUCENE-4899: FastVectorHighlighter failed with StringIndexOutOfBoundsException
  if a single highlight phrase or term was greater than the fragCharSize producing
  negative string offsets. (Simon Willnauer)

* LUCENE-4877: Throw exception for invalid arguments in analysis factories.
  (Steve Rowe, Uwe Schindler, Robert Muir)

* LUCENE-4914: SpatialPrefixTree's Node/Cell.reset() forgot to reset the 'leaf'
  flag.  It affects SpatialRecursivePrefixTreeStrategy on non-point indexed
  shapes, as of Lucene 4.2. (David Smiley)

* LUCENE-4913: FacetResultNode.ordinal was always 0 when all children
  are returned. (Mike McCandless)

* LUCENE-4918: Highlighter closes the given IndexReader if QueryScorer
  is used with an external IndexReader. (Simon Willnauer, Sirvan Yahyaei)

* LUCENE-4880: Fix MemoryIndex to consume empty terms from the tokenstream consistent
  with IndexWriter. Previously it discarded them.  (Timothy Allison via Robert Muir)

* LUCENE-4885: FacetsAccumulator did not set the correct value for
  FacetResult.numValidDescendants. (Mike McCandless, Shai Erera)

* LUCENE-4925: Fixed IndexSearcher.search when the argument list contains a Sort
  and one of the sort fields is the relevance score. Only IndexSearchers created
  with an ExecutorService are concerned. (Adrien Grand)

* LUCENE-4738, LUCENE-2727, LUCENE-2812: Simplified
  DirectoryReader.indexExists so that it's more robust to transient
  IOExceptions (e.g. due to issues like file descriptor exhaustion),
  but this will also cause it to err towards returning true for
  example if the directory contains a corrupted index or an incomplete
  initial commit.  In addition, IndexWriter with OpenMode.CREATE will
  now succeed even if the directory contains a corrupted index (Billow
  Gao, Robert Muir, Mike McCandless)

* LUCENE-4928: Stored fields and term vectors could become super slow in case
  of tiny documents (a few bytes). This is especially problematic when switching
  codecs since bulk-merge strategies can't be applied and the same chunk of
  documents can end up being decompressed thousands of times. A hard limit on
  the number of documents per chunk has been added to fix this issue.
  (Robert Muir, Adrien Grand)

* LUCENE-4934: Fix minor equals/hashcode problems in facet/DrillDownQuery, 
  BoostingQuery, MoreLikeThisQuery, FuzzyLikeThisQuery, and block join queries.
  (Robert Muir, Uwe Schindler)

* LUCENE-4504: Fix broken sort comparator in ValueSource.getSortField,
  used when sorting by a function query.  (Tom Shally via Robert Muir)

* LUCENE-4937: Fix incorrect sorting of float/double values (+/-0, NaN).
  (Robert Muir, Uwe Schindler)

Documentation

* LUCENE-4841: Added example SimpleSortedSetFacetsExample to show how
  to use the new SortedSetDocValues backed facet implementation.
  (Shai Erera, Mike McCandless)

Build

* LUCENE-4879: Upgrade randomized testing to version 2.0.9: 
  Filter stack traces on console output. (Dawid Weiss, Robert Muir)


======================= Lucene 4.2.1 =======================

Bug Fixes

* LUCENE-4713: The SPI components used to load custom codecs or analysis
  components were fixed to also scan the Lucene ClassLoader in addition
  to the context ClassLoader, so Lucene is always able to find its own
  codecs. The special case of a null context ClassLoader is now also
  supported.  (Christian Kohlschütter, Uwe Schindler)

* LUCENE-4819: seekExact(BytesRef, boolean) did not work correctly with
  Sorted[Set]DocValuesTermsEnum.  (Robert Muir)

* LUCENE-4826: PostingsHighlighter was not returning the top N best
  scoring passages. (Robert Muir, Mike McCandless)

* LUCENE-4854: Fix DocTermOrds.getOrdTermsEnum() to not return negative
  ord on initial next().  (Robert Muir)

* LUCENE-4836: Fix SimpleRateLimiter#pause to return the actual time spent
  sleeping instead of the wakeup timestamp in nano seconds. (Simon Willnauer)

* LUCENE-4828: BooleanQuery no longer extracts terms from its MUST_NOT
  clauses.  (Mike McCandless)

* SOLR-4589: Fixed CPU spikes and poor performance in lazy field loading 
  of multivalued fields. (hossman)

* LUCENE-4870: Fix bug where an entire index might be deleted by the IndexWriter
  due to false detection if an index exists in the directory when
  OpenMode.CREATE_OR_APPEND is used. This might also affect application that set
  the open mode manually using DirectoryReader#indexExists. (Simon Willnauer)

* LUCENE-4878: Override getRegexpQuery in MultiFieldQueryParser to prefent
  NullPointerException when regular expression syntax is used with
  MultiFieldQueryParser. (Simon Willnauer, Adam Rauch)

Optimizations

* LUCENE-4819: Added Sorted[Set]DocValues.termsEnum(), and optimized the
  default codec for improved enumeration performance.  (Robert Muir)

* LUCENE-4854: Speed up TermsEnum of FieldCache.getDocTermOrds.
  (Robert Muir)

* LUCENE-4857: Don't unnecessarily copy stem override map in
  StemmerOverrideFilter. (Simon Willnauer)

======================= Lucene 4.2.0 =======================

Changes in backwards compatibility policy

* LUCENE-4602: FacetFields now stores facet ordinals in a DocValues field, 
  rather than a payload. This forces rebuilding existing indexes, or do a
  one time migration using FacetsPayloadMigratingReader. Since DocValues 
  support in-memory caching, CategoryListCache was removed too.
  (Shai Erera, Michael McCandless)

* LUCENE-4697: FacetResultNode is now a concrete class with public members
  (instead of getter methods). (Shai Erera)
  
* LUCENE-4600: FacetsCollector is now an abstract class with two
  implementations: StandardFacetsCollector (the old version of 
  FacetsCollector) and CountingFacetsCollector. FacetsCollector.create()
  returns the most optimized collector for the given parameters.
  (Shai Erera, Michael McCandless)
  
* LUCENE-4700: OrdinalPolicy is now per CategoryListParams, and is no longer
  an interface, but rather an enum with values NO_PARENTS and ALL_PARENTS.
  PathPolicy was removed, you should extend FacetFields and DrillDownStream
  to control which categories are added as drill-down terms. (Shai Erera)

* LUCENE-4547: DocValues improvements:
  - Simplified codec API: codecs are now only responsible for encoding and
    decoding docvalues, they do not need to do buffering or RAM accounting.
  - Per-Field support: added PerFieldDocValuesFormat, which allows you to
    use a different DocValuesFormat per field (like postings).
  - Unified with FieldCache api: DocValues can be accessed via FieldCache API,
    so it works automatically with grouping/join/sort/function queries, etc.
  - Simplified types: There are only 3 types (NUMERIC, BINARY, SORTED), so its
    not necessary to specify for example that all of your binary values have
    the same length. Instead its easy for the Codec API to optimize encoding
    based on any properties of the content.
   (Simon Willnauer, Adrien Grand, Mike McCandless, Robert Muir)

* LUCENE-4757: Cleanup and refactoring of FacetsAccumulator, FacetRequest,
  FacetsAggregator and FacetResultsHandler API. If your application did 
  FacetsCollector.create(), you should not be affected, but if you wrote
  an Aggregator, then you should migrate it to the per-segment
  FacetsAggregator. You can still use StandardFacetsAccumulator, which works
  with the old API (for now). (Shai Erera) 

* LUCENE-4761: Facet packages reorganized. Should be easy to fix your import
  statements, if you use an IDE such as Eclipse. (Shai Erera)

* LUCENE-4750: Convert DrillDown to DrillDownQuery, so you can initialize it
  and add drill-down categories to it. (Michael McCandless, Shai Erera)

* LUCENE-4759: remove FacetRequest.SortBy; result categories are always 
  sorted by value, while ties are broken by category ordinal. (Shai Erera)

* LUCENE-4772: Facet associations moved to new FacetsAggregator API. You
  should override FacetsAccumualtor and return the relevant aggregator,
  for aggregating the association values. (Shai Erera)
  
* LUCENE-4748: A FacetRequest on a non-existent field now returns an
  empty FacetResult instead of skipping it.  (Shai Erera, Mike McCandless)

* LUCENE-4806: The default category delimiter character was changed
  from U+F749 to U+001F, since the latter uses 1 byte vs 3 bytes for
  the former.  Existing facet indices must be reindexed.  (Robert
  Muir, Shai Erera, Mike McCandless)

Optimizations

* LUCENE-4687: BloomFilterPostingsFormat now lazily initializes delegate
  TermsEnum only if needed to do a seek or get a DocsEnum. (Simon Willnauer) 

* LUCENE-4677, LUCENE-4682: unpacked FSTs now use vInt to encode the node target,
  to reduce their size (Mike McCandless)

* LUCENE-4678: FST now uses a paged byte[] structure instead of a
  single byte[] internally, to avoid large memory spikes during
  building (James Dyer, Mike McCandless)

* LUCENE-3298: FST can now be larger than 2.1 GB / 2.1 B nodes.
  (James Dyer, Mike McCandless)

* LUCENE-4690: Performance improvements and non-hashing versions
  of NumericUtils.*ToPrefixCoded() (yonik)

* LUCENE-4715: CategoryListParams.getOrdinalPolicy now allows to return a
  different OrdinalPolicy per dimension, to better tune how you index
  facets. Also added OrdinalPolicy.ALL_BUT_DIMENSION. 
  (Shai Erera, Michael McCandless)

* LUCENE-4740: Don't track clones of MMapIndexInput if unmapping
  is disabled. This reduces GC overhead. (Kristofer Karlsson, Uwe Schindler)

* LUCENE-4733: The default Lucene 4.2 codec now uses a more compact
  TermVectorsFormat (Lucene42TermVectorsFormat) based on
  CompressingTermVectorsFormat. (Adrien Grand)

* LUCENE-3729: The default Lucene 4.2 codec now uses a more compact
  DocValuesFormat (Lucene42DocValuesFormat). Sorted values are stored in an
  FST, Numerics and Ordinals use a number of strategies (delta-compression, 
  table-compression, etc), and memory addresses use MonotonicBlockPackedWriter.
  (Simon Willnauer, Adrien Grand, Mike McCandless, Robert Muir)

* LUCENE-4792: Reduction of the memory required to build the doc ID maps used
  when merging segments. (Adrien Grand)

* LUCENE-4794: Spatial RecursivePrefixTreeStrategy's search filter: Skip calls
  to termsEnum.seek() when the next term is known to follow the current cell.
  (David Smiley)

New Features

* LUCENE-4686: New specialized DGapVInt8IntEncoder for facets (now the 
  default). (Shai Erera)

* LUCENE-4703: Add simple PrintTaxonomyStats tool to see summary
  information about the facets taxonomy index.  (Mike McCandless)

* LUCENE-4599: New oal.codecs.compressing.CompressingTermVectorsFormat which
  compresses term vectors into chunks of documents similarly to
  CompressingStoredFieldsFormat. (Adrien Grand)

* LUCENE-4695: Added LiveFieldValues utility class, for getting the
  current (live, real-time) value for any indexed doc/field.  The
  class buffers recently indexed doc/field values until a new
  near-real-time reader is opened that contains those changes.
  (Robert Muir, Mike McCandless)

* LUCENE-4723: Add AnalyzerFactoryTask to benchmark, and enable analyzer
  creation via the resulting factories using NewAnalyzerTask.  (Steve Rowe)

* LUCENE-4728: Unknown and not explicitly mapped queries are now rewritten
  against the highlighting IndexReader to obtain primitive queries before 
  discarding the query entirely. WeightedSpanTermExtractor now builds a
  MemoryIndex only once even if multiple fields are highlighted.
  (Simon Willnauer)

* LUCENE-4035: Added ICUCollationDocValuesField, more efficient
  support for Locale-sensitive sort and range queries for
  single-valued fields.  (Robert Muir)

* LUCENE-4547: Added MonotonicBlockPacked(Reader/Writer), which provide 
  efficient random access to large amounts of monotonically increasing 
  positive values (e.g. file offsets). Each block stores the minimum value
  and the average gap, and values are encoded as signed deviations from
  the expected value.  (Adrien Grand)
  
* LUCENE-4547: Added AppendingLongBuffer, an append-only buffer that packs
  signed long values in memory and provides an efficient iterator API.
  (Adrien Grand) 

* LUCENE-4540: It is now possible for a codec to represent norms with
  less than 8 bits per value. For performance reasons this is not done
  by default, but you can customize your codec (e.g. pass PackedInts.DEFAULT
  to Lucene42DocValuesConsumer) if you want to make this tradeoff.
  (Adrien Grand, Robert Muir)

* LUCENE-4764: A new Facet42Codec and Facet42DocValuesFormat provide
  faster but more RAM-consuming facet performance.  (Shai Erera, Mike
  McCandless) 

* LUCENE-4769: Added OrdinalsCache and CachedOrdsCountingFacetsAggregator
  which uses the cache to obtain a document's ordinals. This aggregator
  is faster than others, however consumes much more RAM.
  (Michael McCandless, Shai Erera)
  
* LUCENE-4778: Add a getter for the delegate in RateLimitedDirectoryWrapper.
  (Mark Miller)

* LUCENE-4765: Add a multi-valued docvalues type (SORTED_SET). This is equivalent
  to building a FieldCache.getDocTermOrds at index-time.  (Robert Muir)

* LUCENE-4780: Add MonotonicAppendingLongBuffer: an append-only buffer for
  monotonically increasing values.  (Adrien Grand)

* LUCENE-4748: Added DrillSideways utility class for computing both
  drill-down and drill-sideways counts for a DrillDownQuery.  (Mike
  McCandless)
 
API Changes

* LUCENE-4709: FacetResultNode no longer has a residue field. (Shai Erera)

* LUCENE-4716: DrillDown.query now takes Occur, allowing to specify if
  categories should be OR'ed or AND'ed. (Shai Erera)

* LUCENE-4695: ReferenceManager.RefreshListener.afterRefresh now takes
  a boolean indicating whether a new reference was in fact opened, and
  a new beforeRefresh method notifies you when a refresh attempt is
  starting.  (Robert Muir, Mike McCandless)

* LUCENE-4794: Spatial RecursivePrefixTreeFilter replaced by
  IntersectsPrefixTreeFilter and some extensible base classes. (David Smiley)
  
Bug Fixes

* LUCENE-4705: Pass on FilterStrategy in FilteredQuery if the filtered query is 
  rewritten. (Simon Willnauer)

* LUCENE-4712: MemoryIndex#normValues() throws NPE if field doesn't exist. 
  (Simon Willnauer, Ricky Pritchett)

* LUCENE-4550: Shapes wider than 180 degrees would use too much accuracy for the
  PrefixTree based SpatialStrategy. For a pathological case of nearly 360
  degrees and barely any height, it would generate so many indexed terms
  (> 500k) that it could even cause an OutOfMemoryError. Fixed. (David Smiley)

* LUCENE-4704: Make join queries override hashcode and equals methods.
  (Martijn van Groningen)

* LUCENE-4724: Fix bug in CategoryPath which allowed passing null or empty
  string components. This is forbidden now (throws an exception). Note that if
  you have a taxonomy index created with such strings, you should rebuild it.
  (Michael McCandless, Shai Erera)

* LUCENE-4732: Fixed TermsEnum.seekCeil/seekExact on term vectors.
  (Adrien Grand, Robert Muir)

* LUCENE-4739: Fixed bugs that prevented FSTs more than ~1.1GB from
  being saved and loaded (Adrien Grand, Mike McCandless)

* LUCENE-4717: Fixed bug where Lucene40DocValuesFormat would sometimes write 
  an extra unused ordinal for sorted types. The bug is detected and corrected
  on-the-fly for old indexes.  (Robert Muir)

* LUCENE-4547: Fixed bug where Lucene40DocValuesFormat was unable to encode
  segments that would exceed 2GB total data. This could happen in some surprising
  cases, for example if you had an index with more than 260M documents and a 
  VAR_INT field.  (Simon Willnauer, Adrien Grand, Mike McCandless, Robert Muir)

* LUCENE-4775: Remove SegmentInfo.sizeInBytes() and make
  MergePolicy.OneMerge.totalBytesSize thread safe (Josh Bronson via
  Robert Muir, Mike McCandless)

* LUCENE-4770: If spatial's TermQueryPrefixTreeStrategy was used to search
  indexed non-point shapes, then there was an edge case where a query should
  find a shape but it didn't. The fix is the removal of an optimization that
  simplifies some leaf cells into a parent. The index data for such a field is
  now ~20% larger. This optimization is still done for the query shape, and for
  indexed data for RecursivePrefixTreeStrategy. Furthermore, this optimization
  is enhanced to roll up beyond the bottom cell level. (David Smiley,
  Florian Schilling)

* LUCENE-4790: Fix FieldCacheImpl.getDocTermOrds to not bake deletes into the
  cached datastructure. Otherwise this can cause inconsistencies with readers
  at different points in time.  (Robert Muir)

* LUCENE-4791: A conjunction of terms (ConjunctionTermScorer) scanned on
  the lowest frequency term instead of skipping, leading to potentially
  large performance impacts for many non-random or non-uniform
  term distributions.  (John Wang, yonik)

* LUCENE-4798: PostingsHighlighter's formatter sometimes didn't highlight 
  matched terms.  (Robert Muir)

* LUCENE-4796, SOLR-4373: Fix concurrency issue in NamedSPILoader and
  AnalysisSPILoader when doing reload (e.g. from Solr).
  (Uwe Schindler, Hossman)

* LUCENE-4802: Don't compute norms for drill-down facet fields. (Mike McCandless)

* LUCENE-4804: PostingsHighlighter sometimes applied terms to the wrong passage,
  if they started exactly on a passage boundary.  (Robert Muir)

Documentation

* LUCENE-4718: Fixed documentation of oal.queryparser.classic.
  (Hayden Muhl via Adrien Grand)

* LUCENE-4784, LUCENE-4785, LUCENE-4786: Fixed references to deprecated classes
  SinkTokenizer, ValueSourceQuery and RangeQuery. (Hao Zhong via Adrien Grand) 

Build

* LUCENE-4654: Test duration statistics from multiple test runs should be 
  reused. (Dawid Weiss)

* LUCENE-4636: Upgrade ivy to 2.3.0 (Shawn Heisey via Robert Muir)

* LUCENE-4570: Use the Policeman Forbidden API checker, released separately
  from Lucene and downloaded via Ivy.  (Uwe Schindler, Robert Muir)

* LUCENE-4758: 'ant jar', 'ant compile', and 'ant compile-test' should
  recurse.  (Steve Rowe)

======================= Lucene 4.1.0 =======================

Changes in backwards compatibility policy

* LUCENE-4514: Scorer's freq() method returns an integer value indicating
  the number of times the scorer matches the current document. Previously
  this was only sometimes the case, in some cases it returned a (meaningless)
  floating point value.  Scorer now extends DocsEnum so it has attributes().
  (Robert Muir)

* LUCENE-4543: TFIDFSimilarity's index-time computeNorm is now final to
  match the fact that its query-time norm usage requires a FIXED_8 encoding. 
  Override lengthNorm and/or encode/decodeNormValue to change the specifics,
  like Lucene 3.x. (Robert Muir)

* LUCENE-3441: The facet module now supports NRT. As a result, the following
  changes were made:
  - DirectoryTaxonomyReader has a new constructor which takes a 
    DirectoryTaxonomyWriter. You should use that constructor in order to get
    the NRT support (or the old one for non-NRT).
  - TaxonomyReader.refresh() removed in exchange for TaxonomyReader.openIfChanged
    static method. Similar to DirectoryReader, the method either returns null
    if no changes were made to the taxonomy, or a new TR instance otherwise.
    Instead of calling refresh(), you should write similar code to how you reopen
    a regular DirectoryReader.
  - TaxonomyReader.openIfChanged (previously refresh()) no longer throws
    InconsistentTaxonomyException, and supports recreate. InconsistentTaxoEx
    was removed.
  - ChildrenArrays was pulled out of TaxonomyReader into a top-level class.
  - TaxonomyReader was made an abstract class (instead of an interface), with
    methods such as close() and reference counting management pulled from
    DirectoryTaxonomyReader, and made final. The rest of the methods, remained
    abstract.
    (Shai Erera, Gilad Barkai)

* LUCENE-4576: Remove CachingWrapperFilter(Filter, boolean). This recacheDeletes
  option gave less than 1% speedup at the expense of cache churn (filters were
  invalidated on reopen if even a single delete was posted against the segment).
  (Robert Muir)

* LUCENE-4575: Replace IndexWriter's commit/prepareCommit versions that take
  commitData with setCommitData(). That allows committing changes to IndexWriter
  even if the commitData is the only thing that changes.
  (Shai Erera, Michael McCandless)

* LUCENE-4565: TaxonomyReader.getParentArray and .getChildrenArrays consolidated
  into one getParallelTaxonomyArrays(). You can obtain the 3 arrays that the
  previous two methods returned by calling parents(), children() or siblings()
  on the returned ParallelTaxonomyArrays. (Shai Erera)
  
* LUCENE-4585: Spatial PrefixTree based Strategies (either TermQuery or
  RecursivePrefix based) MAY want to re-index if used for point data. If a
  re-index is not done, then an indexed point is ~1/2 the smallest grid cell
  larger and as such is slightly more likely to match a query shape.
  (David Smiley)

* LUCENE-4604: DefaultOrdinalPolicy removed in favor of OrdinalPolicy.ALL_PARENTS.
  Same for DefaultPathPolicy (now PathPolicy.ALL_CATEGORIES). In addition, you
  can use OrdinalPolicy.NO_PARENTS to never write any parent category ordinal
  to the fulltree posting payload (but note that you need a special 
  FacetsAccumulator - see javadocs). (Shai Erera)

* LUCENE-4594: Spatial PrefixTreeStrategy no longer indexes center points of
  non-point shapes.  If you want to call makeDistanceValueSource() based on
  shape centers, you need to do this yourself in another spatial field.
  (David Smiley)

* LUCENE-4615: Replace IntArrayAllocator and FloatArrayAllocator by ArraysPool.
  FacetArrays no longer takes those allocators; if you need to reuse the arrays,
  you should use ReusingFacetArrays. (Shai Erera, Gilad Barkai)

* LUCENE-4621: FacetIndexingParams is now a concrete class (instead of DefaultFIP).
  Also, the entire IndexingParams chain is now immutable. If you need to override
  a setting, you should extend the relevant class.
  Additionally, FacetSearchParams is now immutable, and requires all FacetRequests
  to specified at initialization time. (Shai Erera)

* LUCENE-4647: CategoryDocumentBuilder and EnhancementsDocumentBuilder are replaced
  by FacetFields and AssociationsFacetFields respectively. CategoryEnhancement and
  AssociationEnhancement were removed in favor of a simplified CategoryAssociation
  interface, with CategoryIntAssociation and CategoryFloatAssociation 
  implementations.
  NOTE: indexes that contain category enhancements/associations are not supported
  by the new code and should be recreated. (Shai Erera)

* LUCENE-4659: Massive cleanup to CategoryPath API. Additionally, CategoryPath is 
  now immutable, so you don't need to clone() it. (Shai Erera)

* LUCENE-4670: StoredFieldsWriter and TermVectorsWriter have new finish* callbacks
  which are called after a doc/field/term has been completely added.
  (Adrien Grand, Robert Muir)

* LUCENE-4620: IntEncoder/Decoder were changed to do bulk encoding/decoding. As a
  result, few other classes such as Aggregator and CategoryListIterator were
  changed to handle bulk category ordinals. (Shai Erera)

* LUCENE-4683: CategoryListIterator and Aggregator are now per-segment. As such
  their implementations no longer take a top-level IndexReader in the constructor
  but rather implement a setNextReader. (Shai Erera)
  
New Features

* LUCENE-4226: New experimental StoredFieldsFormat that compresses chunks of
  documents together in order to improve the compression ratio. (Adrien Grand)

* LUCENE-4426: New ValueSource implementations (in lucene/queries) for
  DocValues fields. (Adrien Grand)

* LUCENE-4410: FilteredQuery now exposes a FilterStrategy that exposes
  how filters are applied during query execution. (Simon Willnauer) 

* LUCENE-4404: New ListOfOutputs (in lucene/misc) for FSTs wraps
  another Outputs implementation, allowing you to store more than one
  output for a single input.  UpToTwoPositiveIntsOutputs was moved
  from lucene/core to lucene/misc.  (Mike McCandless)

* LUCENE-3842: New AnalyzingSuggester, for doing auto-suggest
  using an analyzer.  This can create powerful suggesters: if the analyzer
  remove stop words then "ghost chr..." could suggest "The Ghost of
  Christmas Past"; if SynonymFilter is used to map wifi and wireless
  network to hotspot, then "wirele..." could suggest "wifi router";
  token normalization likes stemmers, accent removal, etc. would allow
  the suggester to ignore such variations. (Robert Muir, Sudarshan
  Gaikaiwari, Mike McCandless)

* LUCENE-4446: Lucene 4.1 has a new default index format (Lucene41Codec)
  that incorporates the previously experimental "Block" postings format
  for better search performance. 
  (Han Jiang, Adrien Grand, Robert Muir, Mike McCandless)

* LUCENE-3846: New FuzzySuggester, like AnalyzingSuggester except it
  also finds completions allowing for fuzzy edits in the input string.
  (Robert Muir, Simon Willnauer, Mike McCandless)

* LUCENE-4515: MemoryIndex now supports adding the same field multiple
  times. (Simon Willnauer)

* LUCENE-4489: Added consumeAllTokens option to LimitTokenCountFilter
  (hossman, Robert Muir)

* LUCENE-4566: Add NRT/SearcherManager.RefreshListener/addListener to
  be notified whenever a new searcher was opened. (selckin via Shai
  Erera, Mike McCandless)

* SOLR-4123: Add per-script customizability to ICUTokenizerFactory via
  rule files in the ICU RuleBasedBreakIterator format.
  (Shawn Heisey, Robert Muir, Steve Rowe)

* LUCENE-4590: Added WriteEnwikiLineDocTask - a benchmark task for writing
  Wikipedia category pages and non-category pages into separate line files.
  extractWikipedia.alg was changed to use this task, so now it creates two
  files. (Doron Cohen)

* LUCENE-4290: Added PostingsHighlighter to the highlighter module. It uses
  offsets from the postings lists to highlight documents. (Robert Muir)

* LUCENE-4628: Added CommonTermsQuery that executes high-frequency terms
  in a optional sub-query to prevent slow queries due to "common" terms 
  like stopwords. (Simon Willnauer)

API Changes

* LUCENE-4399: Deprecated AppendingCodec. Lucene's term dictionaries
  no longer seek when writing.  (Adrien Grand, Robert Muir)

* LUCENE-4479: Rename TokenStream.getTokenStream(IndexReader, int, String)
  to TokenStream.getTokenStreamWithOffsets, and return null on failure
  rather than throwing IllegalArgumentException.  (Alan Woodward)

* LUCENE-4472: MergePolicy now accepts a MergeTrigger that provides 
  information about the trigger of the merge ie. merge triggered due
  to a segment merge or a full flush etc. (Simon Willnauer)

* LUCENE-4415: TermsFilter is now immutable. All terms need to be provided
  as constructor argument. (Simon Willnauer)

* LUCENE-4520: ValueSource.getSortField no longer throws IOExceptions
  (Alan Woodward)
  
* LUCENE-4537: RateLimiter is now separated from FSDirectory and exposed via
  RateLimitingDirectoryWrapper. Any Directory can now be rate-limited.
  (Simon Willnauer)  

* LUCENE-4591: CompressingStoredFields{Writer,Reader} now accept a segment
  suffix as a constructor parameter. (Renaud Delbru via Adrien Grand)
  
* LUCENE-4605: Added DocsEnum.FLAG_NONE which can be passed instead of 0 as
  the flag to .docs() and .docsAndPositions(). (Shai Erera)

* LUCENE-4617: Remove FST.pack() method. Previously to make a packed FST,
  you had to make a Builder with willPackFST=true (telling it you will later pack it),
  create your fst with finish(), and then call pack() to get another FST.
  Instead just pass true for doPackFST to Builder and finish() returns a packed FST.
  (Robert Muir)

* LUCENE-4663: Deprecate IndexSearcher.document(int, Set). This was not intended
  to be final, nor named document(). Use IndexSearcher.doc(int, Set) instead.
  (Robert Muir)

* LUCENE-4684: Made DirectSpellChecker extendable.
  (Martijn van Groningen)
  
Bug Fixes

* LUCENE-1822: BaseFragListBuilder hard-coded 6 char margin is too naive.
  (Alex Vigdor, Arcadius Ahouansou, Koji Sekiguchi)

* LUCENE-4468: Fix rareish integer overflows in Lucene41 postings 
  format. (Robert Muir)
  
* LUCENE-4486: Add support for ConstantScoreQuery in Highlighter.
 (Simon Willnauer)

* LUCENE-4485: When CheckIndex terms, terms/docs pairs and tokens,
  these counts now all exclude deleted documents.  (Mike McCandless)

* LUCENE-4479: Highlighter works correctly for fields with term vector
  positions, but no offsets.  (Alan Woodward)

* SOLR-3906: JapaneseReadingFormFilter in romaji mode will return
  romaji even for out-of-vocabulary kana cases (e.g. half-width forms).
  (Robert Muir)

* LUCENE-4511: TermsFilter might return wrong results if a field is not 
  indexed or doesn't exist in the index. (Simon Willnauer)

* LUCENE-4521: IndexWriter.tryDeleteDocument could return true
  (successfully deleting the document) but then on IndexWriter
  close/commit fail to write the new deletions, if no other changes
  happened in the IndexWriter instance.  (Ivan Vasilev via Mike
  McCandless)

* LUCENE-4513: Fixed that deleted nested docs are scored into the
  parent doc when using ToParentBlockJoinQuery. (Martijn van Groningen)

* LUCENE-4534: Fixed WFSTCompletionLookup and Analyzing/FuzzySuggester
  to allow 0 byte values in the lookup keys.  (Mike McCandless)

* LUCENE-4532: DirectoryTaxonomyWriter use a timestamp to denote taxonomy
  index re-creation, which could cause a bug in case machine clocks were
  not synced. Instead, it now tracks an 'epoch' version, which is incremented
  whenever the taxonomy is re-created, or replaced. (Shai Erera)

* LUCENE-4544: Fixed off-by-1 in ConcurrentMergeScheduler that would
  allow 1+maxMergeCount merges threads to be created, instead of just
  maxMergeCount (Radim Kolar, Mike McCandless)

* LUCENE-4567: Fixed NullPointerException in analyzing, fuzzy, and
  WFST suggesters when no suggestions were added (selckin via Mike
  McCandless)

* LUCENE-4568: Fixed integer overflow in
  PagedBytes.PagedBytesData{In,Out}put.getPosition. (Adrien Grand)

* LUCENE-4581: GroupingSearch.setAllGroups(true) was failing to
  actually compute allMatchingGroups (dizh@neusoft.com via Mike
  McCandless)

* LUCENE-4009: Improve TermsFilter.toString (Tim Costermans via Chris
  Male, Mike McCandless)

* LUCENE-4588: Benchmark's EnwikiContentSource was discarding last wiki 
  document and had leaking threads in 'forever' mode. (Doron Cohen)   

* LUCENE-4585: Spatial RecursivePrefixTreeFilter had some bugs that only
  occurred when shapes were indexed.  In what appears to be rare circumstances,
  documents with shapes near a query shape were erroneously considered a match.
  In addition, it wasn't possible to index a shape representing the entire
  globe.

* LUCENE-4595: EnwikiContentSource had a thread safety problem (NPE) in 
  'forever' mode (Doron Cohen)

* LUCENE-4587: fix WordBreakSpellChecker to not throw AIOOBE when presented
  with 2-char codepoints, and to correctly break/combine terms containing
  non-latin characters. (James Dyer, Andreas Hubold)

* LUCENE-4596: fix a concurrency bug in DirectoryTaxonomyWriter.
  (Shai Erera)

* LUCENE-4594: Spatial PrefixTreeStrategy would index center-points in addition
  to the shape to index if it was non-point, in the same field.  But sometimes
  the center-point isn't actually in the shape (consider a LineString), and for
  highly precise shapes it could cause makeDistanceValueSource's cache to load
  parts of the shape's boundary erroneously too.  So center points aren't
  indexed any more; you should use another spatial field. (David Smiley)

* LUCENE-4629: IndexWriter misses to delete documents if a document block is
  indexed and the Iterator throws an exception. Documents were only rolled back
  if the actual indexing process failed. (Simon Willnauer)

* LUCENE-4608: Handle large number of requested fragments better.
  (Martijn van Groningen)

* LUCENE-4633: DirectoryTaxonomyWriter.replaceTaxonomy did not refresh its
  internal reader, which could cause an existing category to be added twice.
  (Shai Erera)

* LUCENE-4461: If you added the same FacetRequest more than once, you would get
  inconsistent results. (Gilad Barkai via Shai Erera)

* LUCENE-4656: Fix regression in IndexWriter to work with empty TokenStreams
  that have no TermToBytesRefAttribute (commonly provided by CharTermAttribute),
  e.g., oal.analysis.miscellaneous.EmptyTokenStream.
  (Uwe Schindler, Adrien Grand, Robert Muir)

* LUCENE-4660: ConcurrentMergeScheduler was taking too long to
  un-pause incoming threads it had paused when too many merges were
  queued up. (Mike McCandless)

* LUCENE-4662: Add missing elided articles and prepositions to FrenchAnalyzer's
  DEFAULT_ARTICLES list passed to ElisionFilter.  (David Leunen via Steve Rowe)

* LUCENE-4671: Fix CharsRef.subSequence method.  (Tim Smith via Robert Muir)

* LUCENE-4465: Let ConstantScoreQuery's Scorer return its child scorer.
  (selckin via Uwe Schindler)
    
Changes in Runtime Behavior
  
* LUCENE-4586: Change default ResultMode of FacetRequest to PER_NODE_IN_TREE.
  This only affects requests with depth>1. If you execute such requests and
  rely on the facet results being returned flat (i.e. no hierarchy), you should
  set the ResultMode to GLOBAL_FLAT. (Shai Erera, Gilad Barkai) 

* LUCENE-1822: Improves the text window selection by recalculating the starting margin
  once all phrases in the fragment have been identified in FastVectorHighlighter. This
  way if a single word is matched in a fragment, it will appear in the middle of the highlight,
  instead of 6 characters from the beginning. This way one can also guarantee that
  the entirety of short texts are represented in a fragment by specifying a large
  enough fragCharSize.
  
Optimizations

* LUCENE-2221: oal.util.BitUtil was modified to use Long.bitCount and
  Long.numberOfTrailingZeros (which are intrinsics since Java 6u18) instead of
  pure java bit twiddling routines in order to improve performance on modern
  JVMs/hardware. (Dawid Weiss, Adrien Grand)

* LUCENE-4509: Enable stored fields compression by default in the Lucene 4.1
  default codec. (Adrien Grand)

* LUCENE-4536: PackedInts on-disk format is now byte-aligned (it used to be
  long-aligned), saving up to 7 bytes per array of values.
  (Adrien Grand, Mike McCandless)

* LUCENE-4512: Additional memory savings for CompressingStoredFieldsFormat.
  (Adrien Grand, Robert Muir)

* LUCENE-4443: Lucene41PostingsFormat no longer writes unnecessary offsets 
  into the skipdata. (Robert Muir)

* LUCENE-4459: Improve WeakIdentityMap.keyIterator() to remove GCed keys
  from backing map early instead of waiting for reap(). This makes test
  failures in TestWeakIdentityMap disappear, too.
  (Uwe Schindler, Mike McCandless, Robert Muir)

* LUCENE-4473: Lucene41PostingsFormat encodes offsets more efficiently
  for low frequency terms (< 128 occurrences).  (Robert Muir)

* LUCENE-4462: DocumentsWriter now flushes deletes, segment infos and builds
  CFS files if necessary during segment flush and not during publishing. The latter
  was a single threaded process while now all IO and CPU heavy computation is done
  concurrently in DocumentsWriterPerThread. (Simon Willnauer)

* LUCENE-4496: Optimize Lucene41PostingsFormat when requesting a subset of
  the postings data (via flags to TermsEnum.docs/docsAndPositions) to use
  ForUtil.skipBlock.  (Robert Muir)

* LUCENE-4497: Don't write PosVIntCount to the positions file in 
  Lucene41PostingsFormat, as its always totalTermFreq % BLOCK_SIZE. (Robert Muir)

* LUCENE-4498: In Lucene41PostingsFormat, when a term appears in only one document, 
  Instead of writing a file pointer to a VIntBlock containing the doc id, just 
  write the doc id.  (Mike McCandless, Robert Muir)

* LUCENE-4515: MemoryIndex now uses Byte/IntBlockPool internally to hold terms and 
  posting lists. All index data is represented as consecutive byte/int arrays to 
  reduce GC cost and memory overhead. (Simon Willnauer) 

* LUCENE-4538: DocValues now caches direct sources in a ThreadLocal exposed via SourceCache. 
  Users of this API can now simply obtain an instance via DocValues#getDirectSource per thread.
  (Simon Willnauer)
  
* LUCENE-4580: DrillDown.query variants return a ConstantScoreQuery with boost set to 0.0f
  so that documents scores are not affected by running a drill-down query. (Shai Erera)  

* LUCENE-4598: PayloadIterator no longer uses top-level IndexReader to iterate on the
  posting's payload. (Shai Erera, Michael McCandless)

* LUCENE-4661: Drop default maxThreadCount to 1 and maxMergeCount to 2
  in ConcurrentMergeScheduler, for faster merge performance on
  spinning-magnet drives (Mike McCandless)
  
Documentation

* LUCENE-4483: Refer to BytesRef.deepCopyOf in Term's constructor that takes BytesRef.
  (Paul Elschot via Robert Muir)

Build

* LUCENE-4650: Upgrade randomized testing to version 2.0.8: make the
  test framework more robust under low memory conditions. (Dawid Weiss)

* LUCENE-4603: Upgrade randomized testing to version 2.0.5: print forked
  JVM PIDs on heartbeat from hung tests (Dawid Weiss)

* Upgrade randomized testing to version 2.0.4: avoid hangs on shutdown
  hooks hanging forever by calling Runtime.halt() in addition to 
  Runtime.exit() after a short delay to allow graceful shutdown (Dawid Weiss)

* LUCENE-4451: Memory leak per unique thread caused by 
  RandomizedContext.contexts static map. Upgrade randomized testing
  to version 2.0.2 (Mike McCandless, Dawid Weiss)

* LUCENE-4589: Upgraded benchmark module's Nekohtml dependency to version
  1.9.17, removing the workaround in Lucene's HTML parser for the
  Turkish locale.  (Uwe Schindler)

* LUCENE-4601: Fix ivy availability check to use typefound, so it works
  if called from another build file.  (Ryan Ernst via Robert Muir)
  
  
======================= Lucene 4.0.0 =======================

Changes in backwards compatibility policy

* LUCENE-4392: Class org.apache.lucene.util.SortedVIntList has been removed.
  (Adrien Grand)

* LUCENE-4393: RollingCharBuffer has been moved to the o.a.l.analysis.util
  package of lucene-analysis-common. (Adrien Grand)

New Features

* LUCENE-1888: Added the option to store payloads in the term
  vectors (IndexableFieldType.storeTermVectorPayloads()). Note 
  that you must store term vector positions to store payloads.
  (Robert Muir)

* LUCENE-3892: Add a new BlockPostingsFormat that bulk-encodes docs,
  freqs and positions in large (size 128) packed-int blocks for faster
  search performance.  This was from Han Jiang's 2012 Google Summer of
  Code project (Han Jiang, Adrien Grand, Robert Muir, Mike McCandless)

* LUCENE-4323: Added support for an absolute maximum CFS segment size
  (in MiB) to LogMergePolicy and TieredMergePolicy.
  (Alexey Lef via Uwe Schindler)
  
* LUCENE-4339: Allow deletes against 3.x segments for easier upgrading.
  Lucene3x Codec is still otherwise read-only, you should not set it
  as the default Codec on IndexWriter, because it cannot write new segments.
  (Mike McCandless, Robert Muir)

* SOLR-3441: ElisionFilterFactory is now MultiTermAware
  (Jack Krupansky via hossman)
  
API Changes

* LUCENE-4391, LUCENE-4440: All methods of Lucene40Codec but
  getPostingsFormatForField are now final. To reuse functionality 
  of Lucene40, you should extend FilterCodec and delegate to Lucene40
  instead of extending Lucene40Codec.  (Adrien Grand, Shai Erea,
  Robert Muir, Uwe Schindler)

* LUCENE-4299: Added Terms.hasPositions() and Terms.hasOffsets().
  Previously you had no real way to know that a term vector field
  had positions or offsets, since this can be configured on a 
  per-field-per-document basis. (Robert Muir)

* Removed DocsAndPositionsEnum.hasPayload() and simplified the
  contract of getPayload(). It returns null if there is no payload,
  otherwise returns the current payload. You can now call it multiple
  times per position if you want. (Robert Muir)

* Removed FieldsEnum. Fields API instead implements Iterable<String>
  and exposes Iterator, so you can iterate over field names with
  for (String field : fields) instead.  (Robert Muir)

* LUCENE-4152: added IndexReader.leaves(), which lets you enumerate
  the leaf atomic reader contexts for all readers in the tree.
  (Uwe Schindler, Robert Muir)

* LUCENE-4304: removed PayloadProcessorProvider. If you want to change
  payloads (or other things) when merging indexes, its recommended
  to just use a FilterAtomicReader + IndexWriter.addIndexes. See the
  OrdinalMappingAtomicReader and TaxonomyMergeUtils in the facets
  module if you want an example of this.
  (Mike McCandless, Uwe Schindler, Shai Erera, Robert Muir)

* LUCENE-4304: Make CompositeReader.getSequentialSubReaders()
  protected. To get atomic leaves of any IndexReader use the new method
  leaves() (LUCENE-4152), which lists AtomicReaderContexts including
  the doc base of each leaf.  (Uwe Schindler, Robert Muir)

* LUCENE-4307: Renamed IndexReader.getTopReaderContext to 
  IndexReader.getContext.  (Robert Muir)

* LUCENE-4316: Deprecate Fields.getUniqueTermCount and remove it from
  AtomicReader. If you really want the unique term count across all
  fields, just sum up Terms.size() across those fields. This method
  only exists so that this statistic can be accessed for Lucene 3.x 
  segments, which don't support Terms.size().  (Uwe Schindler, Robert Muir)

* LUCENE-4321: Change CharFilter to extend Reader directly, as FilterReader
  overdelegates (read(), read(char[], int, int), skip, etc). This made it
  hard to implement CharFilters that were correct. Instead only close() is
  delegated by default: read(char[], int, int) and correct(int) are abstract
  so that its obvious which methods you should implement.  The protected 
  inner Reader is 'input' like CharFilter in the 3.x series, instead of 'in'.  
  (Dawid Weiss, Uwe Schindler, Robert Muir)

* LUCENE-3309: The expert FieldSelector API, used to load only certain
  fields in a stored document, has been replaced with the simpler
  StoredFieldVisitor API.  (Mike McCandless)

* LUCENE-4343: Made Tokenizer.setReader final. This is a setter that should
  not be overridden by subclasses: per-stream initialization should happen
  in reset().  (Robert Muir)

* LUCENE-4377: Remove IndexInput.copyBytes(IndexOutput, long). 
  Use DataOutput.copyBytes(DataInput, long) instead.
  (Mike McCandless, Robert Muir)

* LUCENE-4355: Simplify AtomicReader's sugar methods such as termDocsEnum,
  termPositionsEnum, docFreq, and totalTermFreq to only take Term as a
  parameter. If you want to do expert things such as pass a different
  Bits as liveDocs, then use the flex apis (fields(), terms(), etc) directly.
  (Mike McCandless, Robert Muir)

* LUCENE-4425: clarify documentation of StoredFieldVisitor.binaryValue
  and simplify the api to binaryField(FieldInfo, byte[]).
  (Adrien Grand, Robert Muir)

Bug Fixes

* LUCENE-4423: DocumentStoredFieldVisitor.binaryField ignored offset and
  length. (Adrien Grand)

* LUCENE-4297: BooleanScorer2 would multiply the coord() factor
  twice for conjunctions: for most users this is no problem, but
  if you had a customized Similarity that returned something other
  than 1 when overlap == maxOverlap (always the case for conjunctions),
  then the score would be incorrect.  (Pascal Chollet, Robert Muir)

* LUCENE-4298: MultiFields.getTermDocsEnum(IndexReader, Bits, String, BytesRef)
  did not work at all, it would infinitely recurse.
  (Alberto Paro via Robert Muir)

* LUCENE-4300: BooleanQuery's rewrite was not always safe: if you
  had a custom Similarity where coord(1,1) != 1F, then the rewritten
  query would be scored differently.  (Robert Muir)

* Don't allow negatives in the positions file. If you have an index
  from 2.4.0 or earlier with such negative positions, and you already 
  upgraded to 3.x, then to Lucene 4.0-ALPHA or -BETA, you should run 
  CheckIndex. If it fails, then you need to upgrade again to 4.0  (Robert Muir)

* LUCENE-4303: PhoneticFilterFactory and SnowballPorterFilterFactory load their
  encoders / stemmers via the ResourceLoader now instead of Class.forName().
  Solr users should now no longer have to embed these in its war. (David Smiley)

* SOLR-3737: StempelPolishStemFilterFactory loaded its stemmer table incorrectly.
  Also, ensure immutability and use only one instance of this table in RAM (lazy
  loaded) since its quite large. (sausarkar, Steven Rowe, Robert Muir)

* LUCENE-4310: MappingCharFilter was failing to match input strings
  containing non-BMP Unicode characters.  (Dawid Weiss, Robert Muir,
  Mike McCandless)

* LUCENE-4224: Add in-order scorer to query time joining and the
  out-of-order scorer throws an UOE. (Martijn van Groningen, Robert Muir)

* LUCENE-4333: Fixed NPE in TermGroupFacetCollector when faceting on mv fields.
  (Jesse MacVicar, Martijn van Groningen)

* LUCENE-4218: Document.get(String) and Field.stringValue() again return
  values for numeric fields, like Lucene 3.x and consistent with the documentation.
  (Jamie, Uwe Schindler, Robert Muir)

* NRTCachingDirectory was always caching a newly flushed segment in
  RAM, instead of checking the estimated size of the segment
  to decide whether to cache it. (Mike McCandless)

* LUCENE-3720: fix memory-consumption issues with BeiderMorseFilter.
  (Thomas Neidhart via Robert Muir)

* LUCENE-4401: Fix bug where DisjunctionSumScorer would sometimes call score()
  on a subscorer that had already returned NO_MORE_DOCS.  (Liu Chao, Robert Muir)

* LUCENE-4411: when sampling is enabled for a FacetRequest, its depth
  parameter is reset to the default (1), even if set otherwise.
  (Gilad Barkai via Shai Erera)

* LUCENE-4455: Fix bug in SegmentInfoPerCommit.sizeInBytes() that was
  returning 2X the true size, inefficiently.  Also fixed bug in
  CheckIndex that would report no deletions when a segment has
  deletions, and vice/versa.  (Uwe Schindler, Robert Muir, Mike McCandless)

* LUCENE-4456: Fixed double-counting sizeInBytes for a segment
  (affects how merge policies pick merges); fixed CheckIndex's
  incorrect reporting of whether a segment has deletions; fixed case
  where on abort Lucene could remove files it didn't create; fixed
  many cases where IndexWriter could leave leftover files (on
  exception in various places, on reuse of a segment name after crash
  and recovery.  (Uwe Schindler, Robert Muir, Mike McCandless)
  
Optimizations

* LUCENE-4322: Decrease lucene-core JAR size. The core JAR size had increased a
  lot because of generated code introduced in LUCENE-4161 and LUCENE-3892.
  (Adrien Grand)

* LUCENE-4317: Improve reuse of internal TokenStreams and StringReader
  in oal.document.Field.  (Uwe Schindler, Chris Male, Robert Muir)

* LUCENE-4327: Support out-of-order scoring in FilteredQuery for higher
  performance.  (Mike McCandless, Robert Muir)

* LUCENE-4364: Optimize MMapDirectory to not make a mapping per-cfs-slice,
  instead one map per .cfs file. This reduces the total number of maps.
  Additionally factor out a (package-private) generic 
  ByteBufferIndexInput from MMapDirectory.  (Uwe Schindler, Robert Muir)

Build

* LUCENE-4406, LUCENE-4407: Upgrade to randomizedtesting 2.0.1.
  Workaround for broken test output XMLs due to non-XML text unicode
  chars in strings. Added printing of failed tests at the end of a
  test run (Dawid Weiss)

* LUCENE-4252: Detect/Fail tests when they leak RAM in static fields
  (Robert Muir, Dawid Weiss)

* LUCENE-4360: Support running the same test suite multiple times in 
  parallel (Dawid Weiss)

* LUCENE-3985: Upgrade to randomizedtesting 2.0.0. Added support for 
  thread leak detection. Added support for suite timeouts. (Dawid Weiss)

* LUCENE-4354: Corrected maven dependencies to be consistent with
  the licenses/ folder and the binary release. Some had different
  versions or additional unnecessary dependencies. (selckin via Robert Muir)

* LUCENE-4340: Move all non-default codec, postings format and terms
  dictionary implementations to lucene/codecs. (Adrien Grand)

Documentation

* LUCENE-4302: Fix facet userguide to have HTML loose doctype like
  all other javadocs.  (Karl Nicholas via Uwe Schindler)

======================= Lucene 4.0.0-BETA =======================

New features

* LUCENE-4249: Changed the explanation of the PayloadTermWeight to use the
  underlying PayloadFunction's explanation as the explanation
  for the payload score. (Scott Smerchek via Robert Muir)
  
* LUCENE-4069: Added BloomFilteringPostingsFormat for use with low-frequency terms
  such as primary keys (Mark Harwood, Mike McCandless) 
  
* LUCENE-4201: Added JapaneseIterationMarkCharFilter to normalize Japanese
  iteration marks. (Robert Muir, Christian Moen)

* LUCENE-3832: Added BasicAutomata.makeStringUnion method to efficiently
  create automata from a fixed collection of UTF-8 encoded BytesRef
  (Dawid Weiss, Robert Muir)

* LUCENE-4153: Added option to fast vector highlighting via BaseFragmentsBuilder to
  respect field boundaries in the case of highlighting for multivalued fields.
  (Martijn van Groningen)

* LUCENE-4227: Added DirectPostingsFormat, to hold all postings in
  memory as uncompressed simple arrays.  This uses a tremendous amount
  of RAM but gives good search performance gains.  (Mike McCandless)

* LUCENE-2510, LUCENE-4044: Migrated Solr's Tokenizer-, TokenFilter-, and
  CharFilterFactories to the lucene-analysis module. The API is still
  experimental.  (Chris Male, Robert Muir, Uwe Schindler)

* LUCENE-4230: When pulling a DocsAndPositionsEnum you can now
  specify whether or not you require payloads (in addition to
  offsets); turning one or both off may allow some codec
  implementations to optimize the enum implementation.  (Robert Muir,
  Mike McCandless)

* LUCENE-4203: Add IndexWriter.tryDeleteDocument(AtomicReader reader,
  int docID), to attempt deletion by docID as long as the provided
  reader is an NRT reader, and the segment has not yet been merged
  away (Mike McCandless).
  
* LUCENE-4286: Added option to CJKBigramFilter to always also output
  unigrams. This can be used for a unigram+bigram approach, or at 
  index-time only for better support of short queries.
  (Tom Burton-West, Robert Muir)

API Changes

* LUCENE-4138: update of morfologik (Polish morphological analyzer) to 1.5.3.
  The tag attribute class has been renamed to MorphosyntacticTagsAttribute and
  has a different API (carries a list of tags instead of a compound tag). Upgrade
  of embedded morfologik dictionaries to version 1.9. (Dawid Weiss)

* LUCENE-4178: set 'tokenized' to true on FieldType by default, so that if you
  make a custom FieldType and set indexed = true, its analyzed by the analyzer.
  (Robert Muir)

* LUCENE-4220: Removed the buggy JavaCC-based HTML parser in the benchmark
  module and replaced by NekoHTML. HTMLParser interface was cleaned up while
  changing method signatures.  (Uwe Schindler, Robert Muir)

* LUCENE-2191: Rename Tokenizer.reset(Reader) to Tokenizer.setReader(Reader).
  The purpose of this method was always to set a new Reader on the Tokenizer,
  reusing the object. But the name was often confused with TokenStream.reset().
  (Robert Muir)

* LUCENE-4228: Refactored CharFilter to extend java.io.FilterReader. CharFilters
  filter another reader and you override correct() for offset correction.
  (Robert Muir)

* LUCENE-4240: Analyzer api now just takes fieldName for getOffsetGap. If the
  field is not analyzed (e.g. StringField), then the analyzer is not invoked
  at all. If you want to tweak things like positionIncrementGap and offsetGap,
  analyze the field with KeywordTokenizer instead.  (Grant Ingersoll, Robert Muir)

* LUCENE-4250: Pass fieldName to the PayloadFunction explain method, so it
  parallels with docScore and the default implementation is correct.
  (Robert Muir)

* LUCENE-3747: Support Unicode 6.1.0. (Steve Rowe)

* LUCENE-3884: Moved ElisionFilter out of org.apache.lucene.analysis.fr
  package into org.apache.lucene.analysis.util.  (Robert Muir)

* LUCENE-4230: When pulling a DocsAndPositionsEnum you now pass an int
  flags instead of the previous boolean needOffsets.  Currently
  recognized flags are DocsAndPositionsEnum.FLAG_PAYLOADS and
  DocsAndPositionsEnum.FLAG_OFFSETS (Robert Muir, Mike McCandless)

* LUCENE-4273: When pulling a DocsEnum, you can pass an int flags
  instead of the previous boolean needsFlags; consistent with the changes
  for DocsAndPositionsEnum in LUCENE-4230. Currently the only flag
  is DocsEnum.FLAG_FREQS. (Robert Muir, Mike McCandless)
  
* LUCENE-3616: TextField(String, Reader, Store) was reduced to TextField(String, Reader),
  as the Store parameter didn't make sense: if you supplied Store.YES, you would only 
  receive an exception anyway. (Robert Muir)

Optimizations

* LUCENE-4171: Performance improvements to Packed64.
  (Toke Eskildsen via Adrien Grand)

* LUCENE-4184: Performance improvements to the aligned packed bits impl.
  (Toke Eskildsen, Adrien Grand)

* LUCENE-4235: Remove enforcing of Filter rewrite for NRQ queries.
  (Uwe Schindler)

* LUCENE-4279: Regenerated snowball Stemmers from snowball r554,
  making them substantially more lightweight. Behavior is unchanged. 
  (Robert Muir)

* LUCENE-4291: Reduced internal buffer size for Jflex-based tokenizers 
  such as StandardTokenizer from 32kb to 8kb.  
  (Raintung Li, Steven Rowe, Robert Muir)

Bug Fixes

* LUCENE-4109: BooleanQueries are not parsed correctly with the 
  flexible query parser. (Karsten Rauch via Robert Muir)

* LUCENE-4176: Fix AnalyzingQueryParser to analyze range endpoints as bytes,
  so that it works correctly with Analyzers that produce binary non-UTF-8 terms
  such as CollationAnalyzer. (Nattapong Sirilappanich via Robert Muir) 

* LUCENE-4209: Fix FSTCompletionLookup to close its sorter, so that it won't
  leave temp files behind in /tmp. Fix SortedTermFreqIteratorWrapper to not
  leave temp files behind in /tmp on Windows. Fix Sort to not leave
  temp files behind when /tmp is a separate volume. (Uwe Schindler, Robert Muir)

* LUCENE-4221: Fix overeager CheckIndex validation for term vector offsets.
  (Robert Muir)

* LUCENE-4222: TieredMergePolicy.getFloorSegmentMB was returning the
  size in bytes not MB (Chris Fuller via Mike McCandless)

* LUCENE-3505: Fix bug (Lucene 4.0alpha only) where boolean conjunctions
  were sometimes scored incorrectly. Conjunctions of only termqueries where
  at least one term omitted term frequencies (IndexOptions.DOCS_ONLY) would 
  be scored as if all terms omitted term frequencies.  (Robert Muir)

* LUCENE-2686, LUCENE-3505: Fixed BooleanQuery scorers to return correct 
  freq().  Added support for scorer navigation API (Scorer.getChildren) to 
  all queries.  Made Scorer.freq() abstract. 
  (Koji Sekiguchi, Mike McCandless, Robert Muir)

* LUCENE-4234: Exception when FacetsCollector is used with ScoreFacetRequest, 
  and the number of matching documents is too large. (Gilad Barkai via Shai Erera)

* LUCENE-4245: Make IndexWriter#close() and MergeScheduler#close()
  non-interruptible.  (Mark Miller, Uwe Schindler)

* LUCENE-4190: restrict allowed filenames that a codec may create to
  the patterns recognized by IndexFileNames.  This also fixes
  IndexWriter to only delete files matching this pattern from an index
  directory, to reduce risk when the wrong index path is accidentally
  passed to IndexWriter (Robert Muir, Mike McCandless)
  
* LUCENE-4277: Fix IndexWriter deadlock during rollback if flushable DWPT
  instance are already checked out and queued up but not yet flushed. 
  (Simon Willnauer)

* LUCENE-4282: Automaton FuzzyQuery didn't always deliver all results.
  (Johannes Christen, Uwe Schindler, Robert Muir)

* LUCENE-4289: Fix minor idf inconsistencies/inefficiencies in highlighter.
  (Robert Muir)

Changes in Runtime Behavior

* LUCENE-4109: Enable position increments in the flexible queryparser by default.
  (Karsten Rauch via Robert Muir)
  
* LUCENE-3616: Field throws exception if you try to set a boost on an 
  unindexed field or one that omits norms. (Robert Muir)

Build

* LUCENE-4094: Support overriding file.encoding on forked test JVMs
  (force via -Drandomized.file.encoding=XXX). (Dawid Weiss)

* LUCENE-4189: Test output should include timestamps (start/end for each 
  test/ suite). Added -Dtests.timestamps=[off by default]. (Dawid Weiss)

* LUCENE-4110: Report long periods of forked jvm inactivity (hung tests/ suites).
  Added -Dtests.heartbeat=[seconds] with the default of 60 seconds.
  (Dawid Weiss)

* LUCENE-4160: Added a property to quit the tests after a given
  number of failures has occurred. This is useful in combination
  with -Dtests.iters=N (you can start N iterations and wait for M
  failures, in particular M = 1). -Dtests.maxfailures=M. Alternatively,
  specify -Dtests.failfast=true to skip all tests after the first failure.
  (Dawid Weiss)

* LUCENE-4115: JAR resolution/ cleanup should be done automatically for ant 
  clean/ eclipse/ resolve (Dawid Weiss)

* LUCENE-4199, LUCENE-4202, LUCENE-4206: Add a new target "check-forbidden-apis"
  that parses all generated .class files for use of APIs that use default
  charset, default locale, or default timezone and fail build if violations
  found. This ensures, that Lucene / Solr is independent on local configuration
  options.  (Uwe Schindler, Robert Muir, Dawid Weiss)
  
* LUCENE-4217: Add the possibility to run tests with Atlassian Clover
  loaded from IVY. A development License solely for Apache code was added in
  the tools/ folder, but is not included in releases.  (Uwe Schindler)

Documentation

* LUCENE-4195: Added package documentation and examples for 
  org.apache.lucene.codecs (Alan Woodward via Robert Muir)

Changes in backwards compatibility policy

* LUCENE-1458, LUCENE-2111, LUCENE-2354: Changes from flexible indexing:

  - On upgrading to 4.0, if you do not fully reindex your documents,
    Lucene will emulate the new flex API on top of the old index,
    incurring some performance cost (up to ~10% slowdown, typically).
    To prevent this slowdown, use oal.index.IndexUpgrader
    to upgrade your indexes to latest file format (LUCENE-3082).

    Mixed flex/pre-flex indexes are perfectly fine -- the two
    emulation layers (flex API on pre-flex index, and pre-flex API on
    flex index) will remap the access as required.  So on upgrading to
    4.0 you can start indexing new documents into an existing index.
    To get optimal performance, use oal.index.IndexUpgrader
    to upgrade your indexes to latest file format (LUCENE-3082).

  - The postings APIs (TermEnum, TermDocsEnum, TermPositionsEnum)
    have been removed in favor of the new flexible
    indexing (flex) APIs (Fields, FieldsEnum, Terms, TermsEnum,
    DocsEnum, DocsAndPositionsEnum). One big difference is that field
    and terms are now enumerated separately: a TermsEnum provides a
    BytesRef (wraps a byte[]) per term within a single field, not a
    Term.  Another is that when asking for a Docs/AndPositionsEnum, you
    now specify the skipDocs explicitly (typically this will be the
    deleted docs, but in general you can provide any Bits).

  - The term vectors APIs (TermFreqVector, TermPositionVector, 
    TermVectorMapper) have been removed in favor of the above
    flexible indexing APIs, presenting a single-document inverted
    index of the document from the term vectors.

  - MultiReader ctor now throws IOException

  - Directory.copy/Directory.copyTo now copies all files (not just
    index files), since what is and isn't and index file is now
    dependent on the codecs used.

  - UnicodeUtil now uses BytesRef for UTF-8 output, and some method
    signatures have changed to CharSequence.  These are internal APIs
    and subject to change suddenly.

  - Positional queries (PhraseQuery, *SpanQuery) will now throw an
    exception if use them on a field that omits positions during
    indexing (previously they silently returned no results).

  - FieldCache.{Byte,Short,Int,Long,Float,Double}Parser's API has
    changed -- each parse method now takes a BytesRef instead of a
    String.  If you have an existing Parser, a simple way to fix it is
    invoke BytesRef.utf8ToString, and pass that String to your
    existing parser.  This will work, but performance would be better
    if you could fix your parser to instead operate directly on the
    byte[] in the BytesRef.

  - The internal (experimental) API of NumericUtils changed completely
    from String to BytesRef. Client code should never use this class,
    so the change would normally not affect you. If you used some of
    the methods to inspect terms or create TermQueries out of
    prefix encoded terms, change to use BytesRef. Please note:
    Do not use TermQueries to search for single numeric terms.
    The recommended way is to create a corresponding NumericRangeQuery
    with upper and lower bound equal and included. TermQueries do not
    score correct, so the constant score mode of NRQ is the only
    correct way to handle single value queries.
  
  - NumericTokenStream now works directly on byte[] terms. If you
    plug a TokenFilter on top of this stream, you will likely get
    an IllegalArgumentException, because the NTS does not support
    TermAttribute/CharTermAttribute. If you want to further filter
    or attach Payloads to NTS, use the new NumericTermAttribute.
    
  (Mike McCandless, Robert Muir, Uwe Schindler, Mark Miller, Michael Busch)

* LUCENE-2858, LUCENE-3733: IndexReader was refactored into abstract
  AtomicReader, CompositeReader, and DirectoryReader. To open Directory-
  based indexes use DirectoryReader.open(), the corresponding method in
  IndexReader is now deprecated for easier migration. Only DirectoryReader
  supports commits, versions, and reopening with openIfChanged(). Terms,
  postings, docvalues, and norms can from now on only be retrieved using
  AtomicReader; DirectoryReader and MultiReader extend CompositeReader,
  only offering stored fields and access to the sub-readers (which may be
  composite or atomic). SlowCompositeReaderWrapper (LUCENE-2597) can be
  used to emulate atomic readers on top of composites.
  Please review MIGRATE.txt for information how to migrate old code.
  (Uwe Schindler, Robert Muir, Mike McCandless)

* LUCENE-2265: FuzzyQuery and WildcardQuery now operate on Unicode codepoints,
  not unicode code units. For example, a Wildcard "?" represents any unicode
  character. Furthermore, the rest of the automaton package and RegexpQuery use 
  true Unicode codepoint representation.  (Robert Muir, Mike McCandless)

* LUCENE-2380: The String-based FieldCache methods (getStrings,
  getStringIndex) have been replaced with BytesRef-based equivalents
  (getTerms, getTermsIndex).  Also, the sort values (returned in
  FieldDoc.fields) when sorting by SortField.STRING or
  SortField.STRING_VAL are now BytesRef instances.  See MIGRATE.txt
  for more details. (yonik, Mike McCandless)
 
* LUCENE-2480: Though not a change in backwards compatibility policy, pre-3.0 
  indexes are no longer supported. You should upgrade to 3.x first, then run
  optimize(), or reindex. (Shai Erera, Earwin Burrfoot)
  
* LUCENE-2484: Removed deprecated TermAttribute. Use CharTermAttribute
  and TermToBytesRefAttribute instead.  (Uwe Schindler)

* LUCENE-2600: Remove IndexReader.isDeleted in favor of
  AtomicReader.getDeletedDocs().  (Mike McCandless)

* LUCENE-2667: FuzzyQuery's defaults have changed for more performant 
  behavior: the minimum similarity is 2 edit distances from the word,
  and the priority queue size is 50. To support this, FuzzyQuery now allows
  specifying unscaled edit distances (foobar~2). If your application depends
  upon the old defaults of 0.5 (scaled) minimum similarity and Integer.MAX_VALUE
  priority queue size, you can use FuzzyQuery(Term, float, int, int) to specify 
  those explicitly.
  
* LUCENE-2674: MultiTermQuery.TermCollector.collect now accepts the
  TermsEnum as well.  (Robert Muir, Mike McCandless)

* LUCENE-588: WildcardQuery and QueryParser now allows escaping with 
  the '\' character. Previously this was impossible (you could not escape */?,
  for example).  If your code somehow depends on the old behavior, you will
  need to change it (e.g. using "\\" to escape '\' itself).  
  (Sunil Kamath, Terry Yang via Robert Muir)

* LUCENE-2837: Collapsed Searcher, Searchable into IndexSearcher;
  removed contrib/remote and MultiSearcher (Mike McCandless); absorbed
  ParallelMultiSearcher into IndexSearcher as an optional
  ExecutorServiced passed to its ctor.  (Mike McCandless)

* LUCENE-2908, LUCENE-4037: Removed serialization code from lucene classes. 
  It is recommended that you serialize user search needs at a higher level 
  in your application.
  (Robert Muir, Benson Margulies)

* LUCENE-2831: Changed Weight#scorer, Weight#explain & Filter#getDocIdSet to
  operate on a AtomicReaderContext instead of directly on IndexReader to enable
  searches to be aware of IndexSearcher's context. (Simon Willnauer)
  
* LUCENE-2839: Scorer#score(Collector,int,int) is now public because it is
  called from other classes and part of public API. (Uwe Schindler)
  
* LUCENE-2865: Weight#scorer(AtomicReaderContext, boolean, boolean) now accepts
  a ScorerContext struct instead of booleans.(Simon Willnauer)
  
* LUCENE-2882: Cut over SpanQuery#getSpans to AtomicReaderContext to enforce
  per segment semantics on SpanQuery & Spans. (Simon Willnauer)

* LUCENE-2236: Similarity can now be configured on a per-field basis. See the
  migration notes in MIGRATE.txt for more details.  (Robert Muir, Doron Cohen)

* LUCENE-2315: AttributeSource's methods for accessing attributes are now final,
  else its easy to corrupt the internal states.  (Uwe Schindler)

* LUCENE-2814: The IndexWriter.flush method no longer takes "boolean
  flushDocStores" argument, as we now always flush doc stores (index
  files holding stored fields and term vectors) while flushing a
  segment.  (Mike McCandless)

* LUCENE-2548: Field names (eg in Term, FieldInfo) are no longer
  interned.  (Mike McCandless)

* LUCENE-2883: The contents of o.a.l.search.function has been consolidated into
  the queries module and can be found at o.a.l.queries.function.  See 
  MIGRATE.txt for more information (Chris Male)

* LUCENE-2392, LUCENE-3299: Decoupled vector space scoring from 
  Query/Weight/Scorer. If you extended Similarity directly before, you should 
  extend TFIDFSimilarity instead.  Similarity is now a lower-level API to 
  implement other scoring algorithms.  See MIGRATE.txt for more details.
  (David Nemeskey, Simon Willnauer, Mike McCandless, Robert Muir)

* LUCENE-3330: The expert visitor API in Scorer has been simplified and
  extended to support arbitrary relationships. To navigate to a scorer's 
  children, call Scorer.getChildren().  (Robert Muir)

* LUCENE-2308: Field is now instantiated with an instance of IndexableFieldType,
  of which there is a core implementation FieldType.  Most properties 
  describing a Field have been moved to IndexableFieldType.  See MIGRATE.txt 
  for more details.  (Nikola Tankovic, Mike McCandless, Chris Male)

* LUCENE-3396: ReusableAnalyzerBase.TokenStreamComponents.reset(Reader) now 
  returns void instead of boolean.  If a Component cannot be reset, it should 
  throw an Exception.  (Chris Male)

* LUCENE-3396: ReusableAnalyzerBase has been renamed to Analyzer.  All Analyzer
  implementations must now use Analyzer.TokenStreamComponents, rather than
  overriding .tokenStream() and .reusableTokenStream() (which are now final). 
  (Chris Male)

* LUCENE-3346: Analyzer.reusableTokenStream() has been renamed to tokenStream()
  with the old tokenStream() method removed.  Consequently it is now mandatory
  for all Analyzers to support reusability. (Chris Male)

* LUCENE-3473: AtomicReader.getUniqueTermCount() no longer throws UOE when
  it cannot be easily determined. Instead, it returns -1 to be consistent with
  this behavior across other index statistics.
  (Robert Muir)

* LUCENE-1536: The abstract FilteredDocIdSet.match() method is no longer
  allowed to throw IOException. This change was required to make it conform
  to the Bits interface. This method should never do I/O for performance reasons.
  (Mike McCandless, Uwe Schindler, Robert Muir, Chris Male, Yonik Seeley,
  Jason Rutherglen, Paul Elschot)

* LUCENE-3559: The methods "docFreq" and "maxDoc" on IndexSearcher were removed,
  as these are no longer used by the scoring system. See MIGRATE.txt for more
  details.  (Robert Muir)
  
* LUCENE-3533: Removed SpanFilters, they created large lists of objects and 
  did not scale. (Robert Muir)
  
* LUCENE-3606: IndexReader and subclasses were made read-only. It is no longer
  possible to delete or undelete documents using IndexReader; you have to use
  IndexWriter now. As deleting by internal Lucene docID is no longer possible,
  this requires adding a unique identifier field to your index. Deleting/
  relying upon Lucene docIDs is not recommended anyway, because they can
  change. Consequently commit() was removed and DirectoryReader.open(),
  openIfChanged() no longer take readOnly booleans or IndexDeletionPolicy
  instances. Furthermore, IndexReader.setNorm() was removed. If you need
  customized norm values, the recommended way to do this is by modifying
  Similarity to use an external byte[] or one of the new DocValues
  fields (LUCENE-3108). Alternatively, to dynamically change norms (boost
  *and* length norm) at query time, wrap your AtomicReader using
  FilterAtomicReader, overriding FilterAtomicReader.norms(). To persist the
  changes on disk, copy the FilteredIndexReader to a new index using
  IndexWriter.addIndexes().  (Uwe Schindler, Robert Muir)

* LUCENE-3640: Removed IndexSearcher.close(), because IndexSearcher no longer
  takes a Directory and no longer "manages" IndexReaders, it is a no-op.
  (Robert Muir)

* LUCENE-3684: Add offsets into DocsAndPositionsEnum, and a few
  FieldInfo.IndexOption: DOCS_AND_POSITIONS_AND_OFFSETS.  (Robert
  Muir, Mike McCandless)

* LUCENE-2858, LUCENE-3770: FilterIndexReader was renamed to 
  FilterAtomicReader and now extends AtomicReader. If you want to filter 
  composite readers like DirectoryReader or MultiReader, filter their 
  atomic leaves and build a new CompositeReader (e.g. MultiReader) around 
  them. (Uwe Schindler, Robert Muir) 

* LUCENE-3736: ParallelReader was split into ParallelAtomicReader
  and ParallelCompositeReader. Lucene 3.x's ParallelReader is now
  ParallelAtomicReader; but the new composite variant has improved performance
  as it works on the atomic subreaders. It requires that all parallel
  composite readers have the same subreader structure. If you cannot provide this,
  you can use SlowCompositeReaderWrapper to make all parallel readers atomic
  and use ParallelAtomicReader.  (Uwe Schindler, Mike McCandless, Robert Muir)

* LUCENE-2000: clone() now returns covariant types where possible. (ryan)

* LUCENE-3970: Rename Fields.getUniqueFieldCount -> .size() and
  Terms.getUniqueTermCount -> .size().  (Iulius Curt via Mike McCandless)

* LUCENE-3514: IndexSearcher.setDefaultFieldSortScoring was removed
  and replaced with per-search control via new expert search methods
  that take two booleans indicating whether hit scores and max
  score should be computed.  (Mike McCandless)

* LUCENE-4055: You can't put foreign files into the index dir anymore.

* LUCENE-3866: CompositeReader.getSequentialSubReaders() now returns
  unmodifiable List<? extends IndexReader>. ReaderUtil.Gather was
  removed, as IndexReaderContext.leaves() is now the preferred way
  to access sub-readers.  (Uwe Schindler)

* LUCENE-4155: oal.util.ReaderUtil, TwoPhaseCommit, TwoPhaseCommitTool
  classes were moved to oal.index package. oal.util.CodecUtil class was moved
  to oal.codecs package. oal.util.DummyConcurrentLock was removed
  (no longer used in Lucene 4.0).  (Uwe Schindler)

Changes in Runtime Behavior

* LUCENE-2846: omitNorms now behaves like omitTermFrequencyAndPositions, if you
  omitNorms(true) for field "a" for 1000 documents, but then add a document with
  omitNorms(false) for field "a", all documents for field "a" will have no 
  norms.  Previously, Lucene would fill the first 1000 documents with 
  "fake norms" from Similarity.getDefault(). (Robert Muir, Mike McCandless)

* LUCENE-2846: When some documents contain field "a", and others do not, the
  documents that don't have the field get a norm byte value of 0. Previously, 
  Lucene would populate "fake norms" with Similarity.getDefault() for these 
  documents.  (Robert Muir, Mike McCandless)
  
* LUCENE-2720: IndexWriter throws IndexFormatTooOldException on open, rather 
  than later when e.g. a merge starts. 
  (Shai Erera, Mike McCandless, Uwe Schindler)

* LUCENE-2881: FieldInfos is now tracked per segment.  Before it was tracked
  per IndexWriter session, which resulted in FieldInfos that had the FieldInfo
  properties from all previous segments combined. Field numbers are now tracked
  globally across IndexWriter sessions and persisted into a _X.fnx file on
  successful commit. The corresponding file format changes are backwards-
  compatible. (Michael Busch, Simon Willnauer)
  
* LUCENE-2956, LUCENE-2573, LUCENE-2324, LUCENE-2555: Changes from 
  DocumentsWriterPerThread:

  - IndexWriter now uses a DocumentsWriter per thread when indexing documents.
    Each DocumentsWriterPerThread indexes documents in its own private segment,
    and the in memory segments are no longer merged on flush.  Instead, each
    segment is separately flushed to disk and subsequently merged with normal
    segment merging.

  - DocumentsWriterPerThread (DWPT) is now flushed concurrently based on a
    FlushPolicy.  When a DWPT is flushed, a fresh DWPT is swapped in so that
    indexing may continue concurrently with flushing.  The selected
    DWPT flushes all its RAM resident documents do disk.  Note: Segment flushes
    don't flush all RAM resident documents but only the documents private to
    the DWPT selected for flushing. 
  
  - Flushing is now controlled by FlushPolicy that is called for every add,
    update or delete on IndexWriter. By default DWPTs are flushed either on
    maxBufferedDocs per DWPT or the global active used memory. Once the active
    memory exceeds ramBufferSizeMB only the largest DWPT is selected for
    flushing and the memory used by this DWPT is subtracted from the active
    memory and added to a flushing memory pool, which can lead to temporarily
    higher memory usage due to ongoing indexing.
    
  - IndexWriter now can utilize ramBufferSize > 2048 MB. Each DWPT can address
    up to 2048 MB memory such that the ramBufferSize is now bounded by the max
    number of DWPT available in the used DocumentsWriterPerThreadPool.
    IndexWriters net memory consumption can grow far beyond the 2048 MB limit if
    the application can use all available DWPTs. To prevent a DWPT from
    exhausting its address space IndexWriter will forcefully flush a DWPT if its
    hard memory limit is exceeded. The RAMPerThreadHardLimitMB can be controlled
    via IndexWriterConfig and defaults to 1945 MB. 
    Since IndexWriter flushes DWPT concurrently not all memory is released
    immediately. Applications should still use a ramBufferSize significantly
    lower than the JVMs available heap memory since under high load multiple
    flushing DWPT can consume substantial transient memory when IO performance
    is slow relative to indexing rate.
    
  - IndexWriter#commit now doesn't block concurrent indexing while flushing all
    'currently' RAM resident documents to disk. Yet, flushes that occur while a
    a full flush is running are queued and will happen after all DWPT involved
    in the full flush are done flushing. Applications using multiple threads
    during indexing and trigger a full flush (eg call commit() or open a new
    NRT reader) can use significantly more transient memory.
    
  - IndexWriter#addDocument and IndexWriter.updateDocument can block indexing
    threads if the number of active + number of flushing DWPT exceed a
    safety limit. By default this happens if 2 * max number available thread
    states (DWPTPool) is exceeded. This safety limit prevents applications from
    exhausting their available memory if flushing can't keep up with
    concurrently indexing threads.  
    
  - IndexWriter only applies and flushes deletes if the maxBufferedDelTerms
    limit is reached during indexing. No segment flushes will be triggered
    due to this setting.
    
  - IndexWriter#flush(boolean, boolean) doesn't synchronized on IndexWriter
    anymore. A dedicated flushLock has been introduced to prevent multiple full-
    flushes happening concurrently. 
    
  - DocumentsWriter doesn't write shared doc stores anymore. 
  
  (Mike McCandless, Michael Busch, Simon Willnauer)

* LUCENE-3309: Stored fields no longer record whether they were
  tokenized or not.  In general you should not rely on stored fields
  to record any "metadata" from indexing (tokenized, omitNorms,
  IndexOptions, boost, etc.)  (Mike McCandless)

* LUCENE-3309: Fast vector highlighter now inserts the
  MultiValuedSeparator for NOT_ANALYZED fields (in addition to
  ANALYZED fields).  To ensure your offsets are correct you should
  provide an analyzer that returns 1 from the offsetGap method.
  (Mike McCandless)

* LUCENE-2621: Removed contrib/instantiated.  (Robert Muir)
 
* LUCENE-1768: StandardQueryTreeBuilder no longer uses RangeQueryNodeBuilder
  for RangeQueryNodes, since theses two classes were removed;
  TermRangeQueryNodeProcessor now creates TermRangeQueryNode,
  instead of RangeQueryNode; the same applies for numeric nodes;
  (Vinicius Barros via Uwe Schindler)

* LUCENE-3455: QueryParserBase.newFieldQuery() will throw a ParseException if
  any of the calls to the Analyzer throw an IOException.  QueryParseBase.analyzeRangePart()
  will throw a RuntimeException if an IOException is thrown by the Analyzer.

* LUCENE-4127: IndexWriter will now throw IllegalArgumentException if
  the first token of an indexed field has 0 positionIncrement
  (previously it silently corrected it to 1, possibly masking bugs).
  OffsetAttributeImpl will throw IllegalArgumentException if startOffset
  is less than endOffset, or if offsets are negative.
  (Robert Muir, Mike McCandless)

API Changes

* LUCENE-2302, LUCENE-1458, LUCENE-2111, LUCENE-2514: Terms are no longer
  required to be character based. Lucene views a term as an arbitrary byte[]:
  during analysis, character-based terms are converted to UTF8 byte[],
  but analyzers are free to directly create terms as byte[]
  (NumericField does this, for example).  The term data is buffered as
  byte[] during indexing, written as byte[] into the terms dictionary,
  and iterated as byte[] (wrapped in a BytesRef) by IndexReader for
  searching.

* LUCENE-1458, LUCENE-2111: AtomicReader now directly exposes its
  deleted docs (getDeletedDocs), providing a new Bits interface to
  directly query by doc ID.

* LUCENE-2691: IndexWriter.getReader() has been made package local and is now
  exposed via open and reopen methods on DirectoryReader.  The semantics of the
  call is the same as it was prior to the API change.
  (Grant Ingersoll, Mike McCandless)

* LUCENE-2566: QueryParser: Unary operators +,-,! will not be treated as
  operators if they are followed by whitespace. (yonik)
  
* LUCENE-2831: Weight#scorer, Weight#explain, Filter#getDocIdSet,
  Collector#setNextReader & FieldComparator#setNextReader now expect an
  AtomicReaderContext instead of an IndexReader. (Simon Willnauer)

* LUCENE-2892: Add QueryParser.newFieldQuery (called by getFieldQuery by 
  default) which takes Analyzer as a parameter, for easier customization by 
  subclasses.  (Robert Muir)

* LUCENE-2953: In addition to changes in 3.x, PriorityQueue#initialize(int)
  function was moved into the ctor. (Uwe Schindler, Yonik Seeley)

* LUCENE-3219: SortField type properties have been moved to an enum
  SortField.Type.  In be consistent, CachedArrayCreator.getSortTypeID() has
  been changed CachedArrayCreator.getSortType(). (Chris Male)

* LUCENE-3225: Add TermsEnum.seekExact for faster seeking when you
  don't need the ceiling term; renamed existing seek methods to either
  seekCeil or seekExact; changed seekExact(ord) to return no value.
  Fixed MemoryCodec and SimpleTextCodec to optimize the seekExact
  case, and fixed places in Lucene to use seekExact when possible.
  (Mike McCandless)

* LUCENE-1536: Filter.getDocIdSet() now takes an acceptDocs Bits interface (like
  Scorer) limiting the documents that can appear in the returned DocIdSet.
  Filters are now required to respect these acceptDocs, otherwise deleted documents
  may get returned by searches. Most filters will pass these Bits down to DocsEnum,
  but those, e.g. working on FieldCache, may need to use BitsFilteredDocIdSet.wrap()
  to exclude them.
  (Mike McCandless, Uwe Schindler, Robert Muir, Chris Male, Yonik Seeley,
  Jason Rutherglen, Paul Elschot)

* LUCENE-3722: Similarity methods and collection/term statistics now take
  long instead of int (to enable distributed scoring of > 2B docs).
  (Yonik Seeley, Andrzej Bialecki, Robert Muir)

* LUCENE-3761: Generalize SearcherManager into an abstract ReferenceManager.
  SearcherManager remains a concrete class, but due to the refactoring, the 
  method maybeReopen has been deprecated in favor of maybeRefresh().
  (Shai Erera, Mike McCandless, Simon Willnauer)

* LUCENE-3859: AtomicReader.hasNorms(field) is deprecated, instead you
  can inspect the FieldInfo yourself to see if norms are present, which
  also allows you to get the type.  (Robert Muir)

* LUCENE-2606: Changed RegexCapabilities interface to fix thread 
  safety, serialization, and performance problems. If you have
  written a custom RegexCapabilities it will need to be updated
  to the new API.  (Robert Muir, Uwe Schindler)

* LUCENE-2638 MakeHighFreqTerms.TermStats public to make it more useful
  for API use. (Andrzej Bialecki)

* LUCENE-2912: The field-specific hashmaps in SweetSpotSimilarity were removed.
  Instead, use PerFieldSimilarityWrapper to return different SweetSpotSimilaritys
  for different fields, this way all parameters (such as TF factors) can be 
  customized on a per-field basis.  (Robert Muir)

* LUCENE-3308: DuplicateFilter keepMode and processingMode have been converted to
  enums DuplicateFilter.KeepMode and DuplicateFilter.ProcessingMode respectively.

* LUCENE-3483: Move Function grouping collectors from Solr to grouping module.
  (Martijn van Groningen)
   
* LUCENE-3606: FieldNormModifier was deprecated, because IndexReader's
  setNorm() was deprecated. Furthermore, this class is broken, as it does
  not take position overlaps into account while recalculating norms.
  (Uwe Schindler, Robert Muir)

* LUCENE-3936: Renamed StringIndexDocValues to DocTermsIndexDocValues.
  (Martijn van Groningen)

* LUCENE-1768: Deprecated Parametric(Range)QueryNode, RangeQueryNode(Builder),
  ParametricRangeQueryNodeProcessor were removed. (Vinicius Barros via Uwe Schindler)

* LUCENE-3820: Deprecated constructors accepting pattern matching bounds. The input
  is buffered and matched in one pass. (Dawid Weiss)

* LUCENE-2413: Deprecated PatternAnalyzer in common/miscellaneous, in favor 
  of the pattern package (CharFilter, Tokenizer, TokenFilter).  (Robert Muir)

* LUCENE-2413: Removed the AnalyzerUtil in common/miscellaneous.  (Robert Muir)

* LUCENE-1370: Added ShingleFilter option to output unigrams if no shingles
  can be generated. (Chris Harris via Steven Rowe)
   
* LUCENE-2514, LUCENE-2551: JDK and ICU CollationKeyAnalyzers were changed to
  use pure byte keys when Version >= 4.0. This cuts sort key size approximately
  in half. (Robert Muir)

* LUCENE-3400: Removed DutchAnalyzer.setStemDictionary (Chris Male)

* LUCENE-3431: Removed QueryAutoStopWordAnalyzer.addStopWords* deprecated methods
  since they prevented reuse.  Stopwords are now generated at instantiation through
  the Analyzer's constructors. (Chris Male)

* LUCENE-3434: Removed ShingleAnalyzerWrapper.set* and PerFieldAnalyzerWrapper.addAnalyzer
  since they prevent reuse.  Both Analyzers should be configured at instantiation.
  (Chris Male)

* LUCENE-3765: Stopset ctors that previously took Set<?> or Map<?,String> now take
  CharArraySet and CharArrayMap respectively. Previously the behavior was confusing,
  and sometimes different depending on the type of set, and ultimately a CharArraySet
  or CharArrayMap was always used anyway.  (Robert Muir)

* LUCENE-3830: Switched to NormalizeCharMap.Builder to create
  immutable instances of NormalizeCharMap. (Dawid Weiss, Mike
  McCandless)

* LUCENE-4063: FrenchLightStemmer no longer deletes repeated digits.
  (Tanguy Moal via Steve Rowe)

* LUCENE-4122: Replace Payload with BytesRef. (Andrzej Bialecki)

* LUCENE-4132: IndexWriter.getConfig() now returns a LiveIndexWriterConfig object 
  which can be used to change the IndexWriter's live settings. IndexWriterConfig 
  is used only for initializing the IndexWriter. (Shai Erera)

* LUCENE-3866: IndexReaderContext.leaves() is now the preferred way to access
  atomic sub-readers of any kind of IndexReader (for AtomicReaders it returns
  itself as only leaf with docBase=0).  (Uwe Schindler)

New features

* LUCENE-2604: Added RegexpQuery support to QueryParser. Regular expressions
  are directly supported by the standard queryparser via 
     fieldName:/expression/ OR /expression against default field/
  Users who wish to search for literal "/" characters are advised to 
  backslash-escape or quote those characters as needed. 
  (Simon Willnauer, Robert Muir)

* LUCENE-1606, LUCENE-2089: Adds AutomatonQuery, a MultiTermQuery that 
  matches terms against a finite-state machine. Implement WildcardQuery
  and FuzzyQuery with finite-state methods. Adds RegexpQuery.
  (Robert Muir, Mike McCandless, Uwe Schindler, Mark Miller)

* LUCENE-3662: Add support for levenshtein distance with transpositions
  to LevenshteinAutomata, FuzzyTermsEnum, and DirectSpellChecker.
  (Jean-Philippe Barrette-LaPierre, Robert Muir)

* LUCENE-2321: Cutover to a more RAM efficient packed-ints based
  representation for the in-memory terms dict index.  (Mike
  McCandless)

* LUCENE-2126: Add new classes for data (de)serialization: DataInput
  and DataOutput.  IndexInput and IndexOutput extend these new classes.
  (Michael Busch)

* LUCENE-1458, LUCENE-2111: With flexible indexing it is now possible
  for an application to create its own postings codec, to alter how
  fields, terms, docs and positions are encoded into the index.  The
  standard codec is the default codec. IndexWriter accepts a Codec
  class to obtain codecs for newly written segments.

* LUCENE-1458, LUCENE-2111: Some experimental codecs have been added
  for flexible indexing, including pulsing codec (inlines
  low-frequency terms directly into the terms dict, avoiding seeking
  for some queries), sep codec (stores docs, freqs, positions, skip
  data and payloads in 5 separate files instead of the 2 used by
  standard codec), and int block (really a "base" for using
  block-based compressors like PForDelta for storing postings data).
  
* LUCENE-1458, LUCENE-2111: The in-memory terms index used by standard
  codec is more RAM efficient: terms data is stored as block byte
  arrays and packed integers.  Net RAM reduction for indexes that have
  many unique terms should be substantial, and initial open time for
  IndexReaders should be faster.  These gains only apply for newly
  written segments after upgrading.

* LUCENE-1458, LUCENE-2111: Terms data are now buffered directly as
  byte[] during indexing, which uses half the RAM for ascii terms (and
  also numeric fields).  This can improve indexing throughput for
  applications that have many unique terms, since it reduces how often
  a new segment must be flushed given a fixed RAM buffer size.

* LUCENE-2489: Added PerFieldCodecWrapper (in oal.index.codecs) which
  lets you set the Codec per field (Mike McCandless)

* LUCENE-2373: Extend Codec to use SegmentInfosWriter and
  SegmentInfosReader to allow customization of SegmentInfos data.
  (Andrzej Bialecki)

* LUCENE-2504: FieldComparator.setNextReader now returns a
  FieldComparator instance.  You can "return this", to just reuse the
  same instance, or you can return a comparator optimized to the new
  segment.  (yonik, Mike McCandless)
  
* LUCENE-2648: PackedInts.Iterator now supports to advance by more than a
  single ordinal. (Simon Willnauer) 
  
* LUCENE-2649: Objects in the FieldCache can optionally store Bits
  that mark which docs have real values in the native[] (ryan)

* LUCENE-2664: Add SimpleText codec, which stores all terms/postings
  data in a single text file for transparency (at the expense of poor
  performance).  (Sahin Buyrukbilen via Mike McCandless)

* LUCENE-2589: Add a VariableSizedIntIndexInput, which, when used w/
  Sep*, makes it simple to take any variable sized int block coders
  (like Simple9/16) and use them in a codec.  (Mike McCandless)

* LUCENE-2597: Add oal.index.SlowCompositeReaderWrapper, to wrap a
  composite reader (eg MultiReader or DirectoryReader), making it
  pretend it's an atomic reader.  This is a convenience class (you can
  use MultiFields static methods directly, instead) if you need to use
  the flex APIs directly on a composite reader.  (Mike McCandless)

* LUCENE-2690: MultiTermQuery boolean rewrites per segment.
  (Uwe Schindler, Robert Muir, Mike McCandless, Simon Willnauer)

* LUCENE-996: The QueryParser now accepts mixed inclusive and exclusive
  bounds for range queries.  Example: "{3 TO 5]"
  QueryParser subclasses that overrode getRangeQuery will need to be changed
  to use the new getRangeQuery method.  (Andrew Schurman, Mark Miller, yonik)

* LUCENE-2742: Add native per-field postings format support. Codec lets you now
  register a postings format for each field and which is in turn recorded 
  into the index. Postings formats are maintained on a per-segment basis and be
  resolved without knowing the actual postings format used for writing the segment.
  (Simon Willnauer)

* LUCENE-2741: Add support for multiple codecs that use the same file
  extensions within the same segment. Codecs now use their per-segment codec
  ID in the file names. (Simon Willnauer)

* LUCENE-2843: Added a new terms index impl,
  VariableGapTermsIndexWriter/Reader, that accepts a pluggable
  IndexTermSelector for picking which terms should be indexed in the
  terms dict.  This impl stores the indexed terms in an FST, which is
  much more RAM efficient than FixedGapTermsIndex.  (Mike McCandless)

* LUCENE-2862: Added TermsEnum.totalTermFreq() and
  Terms.getSumTotalTermFreq().  (Mike McCandless, Robert Muir)

* LUCENE-3290: Added Terms.getSumDocFreq()  (Mike McCandless, Robert Muir)

* LUCENE-3003: Added new expert class oal.index.DocTermsOrd,
  refactored from Solr's UnInvertedField, for accessing term ords for
  multi-valued fields, per document.  This is similar to FieldCache in
  that it inverts the index to compute the ords, but differs in that
  it's able to handle multi-valued fields and does not hold the term
  bytes in RAM. (Mike McCandless)
  
* LUCENE-3108, LUCENE-2935, LUCENE-2168, LUCENE-1231: Changes from 
  DocValues (ColumnStrideFields):
  
  - IndexWriter now supports typesafe dense per-document values stored in
    a column like storage. DocValues are stored on a per-document
    basis where each documents field can hold exactly one value of a given
    type. DocValues are provided via Fieldable and can be used in
    conjunction with stored and indexed values.
     
  - DocValues provides an entirely RAM resident document id to value
    mapping per field as well as a DocIdSetIterator based disk-resident
    sequential access API relying on filesystem-caches.
    
  - Both APIs are exposed via IndexReader and the Codec / Flex API allowing
    expert users to integrate customized DocValues reader and writer
    implementations by extending existing Codecs.
    
  - DocValues provides implementations for primitive datatypes like int,
    long, float, double and arrays of byte. Byte based implementations further
    provide storage variants like straight or dereferenced stored bytes, fixed
    and variable length bytes as well as index time sorted based on 
    user-provided comparators.
  
  (Mike McCandless, Simon Willnauer)  

* LUCENE-3209: Added MemoryCodec, which stores all terms & postings in
  RAM as an FST; this is good for primary-key fields if you frequently
  need to lookup by that field or perform deletions against it, for
  example in a near-real-time setting. (Mike McCandless)

* SOLR-2533: Added support for rewriting Sort and SortFields using an
  IndexSearcher.  SortFields can have SortField.REWRITEABLE type which
  requires they are rewritten before they are used. (Chris Male)

* LUCENE-3203: FSDirectory can now limit the max allowed write rate
  (MB/sec) of all running merges, to reduce impact ongoing merging has
  on searching, NRT reopen time, etc.  (Mike McCandless)

* LUCENE-2793: Directory#createOutput & Directory#openInput now accept an
  IOContext instead of a buffer size to allow low level optimizations for 
  different usecases like merging, flushing and reading.
  (Simon Willnauer, Mike McCandless, Varun Thacker)

* LUCENE-3354: FieldCache can cache DocTermOrds. (Martijn van Groningen)

* LUCENE-3376: ReusableAnalyzerBase has been moved from modules/analysis/common
  into lucene/src/java/org/apache/lucene/analysis (Chris Male)

* LUCENE-3423: add Terms.getDocCount(), which returns the number of documents
  that have at least one term for a field.  (Yonik Seeley, Robert Muir)

* LUCENE-2959: Added a variety of different relevance ranking systems to Lucene.

  - Added Okapi BM25, Language Models, Divergence from Randomness, and 
    Information-Based Models. The models are pluggable, support all of lucene's 
    features (boosts, slops, explanations, etc) and queries (spans, etc).

  - All models default to the same index-time norm encoding as 
    DefaultSimilarity, so you can easily try these out/switch back and 
    forth/run experiments and comparisons without reindexing. Note: most of 
    the models do rely upon index statistics that are new in Lucene 4.0, so 
    for existing 3.x indexes its a good idea to upgrade your index to the 
    new format with IndexUpgrader first.

  - Added a new subclass SimilarityBase which provides a simplified API 
    for plugging in new ranking algorithms without dealing with all of the
    nuances and implementation details of Lucene. 

  - For example, to use BM25 for all fields: 
     searcher.setSimilarity(new BM25Similarity());

    If you instead want to apply different similarities (e.g. ones with 
    different parameter values or different algorithms entirely) to different
    fields, implement PerFieldSimilarityWrapper with your per-field logic.

  (David Mark Nemeskey via Robert Muir)

* LUCENE-3396: ReusableAnalyzerBase now provides a ReuseStrategy abstraction 
  which controls how TokenStreamComponents are reused per request.  Two 
  implementations are provided - GlobalReuseStrategy which implements the
  current behavior of sharing components between all fields, and 
  PerFieldReuseStrategy which shares per field.  (Chris Male)
  
* LUCENE-2309: Added IndexableField.tokenStream(Analyzer) which is now 
  responsible for creating the TokenStreams for Fields when they are to 
  be indexed.  (Chris Male)
  
* LUCENE-3433: Added random access for non RAM resident IndexDocValues. RAM
  resident and disk resident IndexDocValues are now exposed via the Source
  interface. ValuesEnum has been removed in favour of Source. (Simon Willnauer)

* LUCENE-1536: Filters can now be applied down-low, if their DocIdSet implements
  a new bits() method, returning all documents in a random access way. If the
  DocIdSet is not too sparse, it will be passed as acceptDocs down to the Scorer
  as replacement for AtomicReader's live docs.
  In addition, FilteredQuery backs now IndexSearcher's filtering search methods.
  Using FilteredQuery you can chain Filters in a very performant way
  [new FilteredQuery(new FilteredQuery(query, filter1), filter2)], which was not
  possible with IndexSearcher's methods. FilteredQuery also allows to override
  the heuristics used to decide if filtering should be done random access or
  using a conjunction on DocIdSet's iterator().
  (Mike McCandless, Uwe Schindler, Robert Muir, Chris Male, Yonik Seeley,
  Jason Rutherglen, Paul Elschot)

* LUCENE-3638: Added sugar methods to IndexReader and IndexSearcher to
  load only certain fields when loading a document.  (Peter Chang via
  Mike McCandless)
  
* LUCENE-3628: Norms are represented as DocValues. AtomicReader exposes
  a #normValues(String) method to obtain norms per field. (Simon Willnauer) 

* LUCENE-3687: Similarity#computeNorm(FieldInvertState, Norm) allows to compute
  norm values or arbitrary precision. Instead of returning a fixed single byte
  value, custom similarities can now set a integer, float or byte value to the
  given Norm object. (Simon Willnauer)  

* LUCENE-2604, LUCENE-4103: Added RegexpQuery support to contrib/queryparser.
  (Simon Willnauer, Robert Muir, Daniel Truemper)

* LUCENE-2373: Added a Codec implementation that works with append-only
  filesystems (such as e.g. Hadoop DFS). SegmentInfos writing/reading
  code is refactored to support append-only FS, and to allow for future
  customization of per-segment information. (Andrzej Bialecki)

* LUCENE-2479: Added ability to provide a sort comparator for spelling suggestions along
  with two implementations.  The existing comparator (score, then frequency) is the default (Grant Ingersoll)

* LUCENE-2608: Added the ability to specify the accuracy at method time in the SpellChecker.  The per class
  method is also still available.  (Grant Ingersoll)
    
* LUCENE-2507: Added DirectSpellChecker, which retrieves correction candidates directly 
  from the term dictionary using levenshtein automata.  (Robert Muir)

* LUCENE-3527: Add LuceneLevenshteinDistance, which computes string distance in a compatible
  way as DirectSpellChecker. This can be used to merge top-N results from more than one
  SpellChecker.  (James Dyer via Robert Muir)

* LUCENE-3496: Support grouping by DocValues. (Martijn van Groningen)

* LUCENE-2795: Generified DirectIOLinuxDirectory to work across any
  unix supporting the O_DIRECT flag when opening a file (tested on
  Linux and OS X but likely other Unixes will work), and improved it
  so it can be used for indexing and searching.  The directory uses
  direct IO when doing large merges to avoid  unnecessarily evicting
  cached IO pages due to large merges.  (Varun Thacker, Mike
  McCandless)

* LUCENE-3827: DocsAndPositionsEnum from MemoryIndex implements
  start/endOffset, if offsets are indexed. (Alan Woodward via Mike
  McCandless)

* LUCENE-3802, LUCENE-3856: Support for grouped faceting. (Martijn van Groningen)

* LUCENE-3444: Added a second pass grouping collector that keeps track of distinct
  values for a specified field for the top N group. (Martijn van Groningen)

* LUCENE-3778: Added a grouping utility class that makes it easier to use result
  grouping for pure Lucene apps. (Martijn van Groningen)

* LUCENE-2341: A new analysis/ filter: Morfologik - a dictionary-driven lemmatizer 
  (accurate stemmer) for Polish (includes morphosyntactic annotations).
  (Michał Dybizbański, Dawid Weiss)

* LUCENE-2413: Consolidated Lucene/Solr analysis components into analysis/common. 
  New features from Solr now available to Lucene users include:
   - o.a.l.analysis.commongrams: Constructs n-grams for frequently occurring terms
     and phrases. 
   - o.a.l.analysis.charfilter.HTMLStripCharFilter: CharFilter that strips HTML 
     constructs.
   - o.a.l.analysis.miscellaneous.WordDelimiterFilter: TokenFilter that splits words 
     into subwords and performs optional transformations on subword groups.
   - o.a.l.analysis.miscellaneous.RemoveDuplicatesTokenFilter: TokenFilter which 
     filters out Tokens at the same position and Term text as the previous token.
   - o.a.l.analysis.miscellaneous.TrimFilter: Trims leading and trailing whitespace 
     from Tokens in the stream.
   - o.a.l.analysis.miscellaneous.KeepWordFilter: A TokenFilter that only keeps tokens 
     with text contained in the required words (inverse of StopFilter).
   - o.a.l.analysis.miscellaneous.HyphenatedWordsFilter: A TokenFilter that puts 
     hyphenated words broken into two lines back together.
   - o.a.l.analysis.miscellaneous.CapitalizationFilter: A TokenFilter that applies
     capitalization rules to tokens.
   - o.a.l.analysis.pattern: Package for pattern-based analysis, containing a 
     CharFilter, Tokenizer, and TokenFilter for transforming text with regexes.
   - o.a.l.analysis.synonym.SynonymFilter: A synonym filter that supports multi-word
     synonyms.
   - o.a.l.analysis.phonetic: Package for phonetic search, containing various
     phonetic encoders such as Double Metaphone.

   Some existing analysis components changed packages:
    - o.a.l.analysis.KeywordAnalyzer -> o.a.l.analysis.core.KeywordAnalyzer
    - o.a.l.analysis.KeywordTokenizer -> o.a.l.analysis.core.KeywordTokenizer

   All analyzers in contrib/analyzers and contrib/icu were moved to the
   analysis/ module.  The 'smartcn' and 'stempel' components now depend on 'common'.
   (Chris Male, Robert Muir)

* LUCENE-4004: Add DisjunctionMaxQuery support to the xml query parser.
  (Benson Margulies via Robert Muir)

* LUCENE-4025: Add maybeRefreshBlocking to ReferenceManager, to let a caller 
  block until the refresh logic has been executed. (Shai Erera, Mike McCandless)
  
* LUCENE-4039: Add AddIndexesTask to benchmark, which uses IW.addIndexes. 
  (Shai Erera)

* LUCENE-3514: Added IndexSearcher.searchAfter when Sort is used,
  returning results after a specified FieldDoc for deep
  paging.  (Mike McCandless)

* LUCENE-4043: Added scoring support via score mode for query time joining.
  (Martijn van Groningen, Mike McCandless)
  
* LUCENE-3523: Added oal.search.spell.WordBreakSpellChecker, which 
    generates suggestions by combining two or more terms and/or 
    breaking terms into multiple words.  See Javadocs for usage. (James Dyer)

* LUCENE-4019: Added improved parsing of Hunspell Dictionaries so those
  rules missing the required number of parameters either ignored or 
  cause a ParseException (depending on whether strict parsing is enabled).
  (Luca Cavanna via Chris Male) 

* LUCENE-3440: Add ordered fragments feature with IDF-weighted terms for FVH.
  (Sebastian Lutze via Koji Sekiguchi)

* LUCENE-4082: Added explain to ToParentBlockJoinQuery.
  (Christoph Kaser, Martijn van Groningen)

* LUCENE-4108: add replaceTaxonomy to DirectoryTaxonomyWriter, which replaces
  the taxonomy in place with the given one. (Shai Erera)

* LUCENE-3030: new BlockTree terms dictionary (used by the default
  Lucene40 postings format) uses less RAM (for the terms index) and
  disk space (for all terms and metadata) and gives sizable
  performance gains for terms dictionary intensive operations like
  FuzzyQuery, direct spell checker and primary-key lookup (Mike
  McCandless).

Optimizations

* LUCENE-2588: Don't store unnecessary suffixes when writing the terms
  index, saving RAM in IndexReader; change default terms index
  interval from 128 to 32, because the terms index now requires much
  less RAM.  (Robert Muir, Mike McCandless)

* LUCENE-2669: Optimize NumericRangeQuery.NumericRangeTermsEnum to
  not seek backwards when a sub-range has no terms. It now only seeks
  when the current term is less than the next sub-range's lower end.
  (Uwe Schindler, Mike McCandless)
  
* LUCENE-2694: Optimize MultiTermQuery to be single pass for Term lookups.
  MultiTermQuery now stores TermState per leaf reader during rewrite to re-
  seek the term dictionary in TermQuery / TermWeight.
  (Simon Willnauer, Mike McCandless, Robert Muir)

* LUCENE-3292: IndexWriter no longer shares the same SegmentReader
  instance for merging and NRT readers, which enables directory impls
  to separately tune IO flags for each.  (Varun Thacker, Simon
  Willnauer, Mike McCandless)

* LUCENE-3328: BooleanQuery now uses a specialized ConjunctionScorer if all
  boolean clauses are required and instances of TermQuery. 
  (Simon Willnauer, Robert Muir)
  
* LUCENE-3643: FilteredQuery and IndexSearcher.search(Query, Filter,...)
  now optimize the special case query instanceof MatchAllDocsQuery to
  execute as ConstantScoreQuery.  (Uwe Schindler)

* LUCENE-3509: Added fasterButMoreRam option for docvalues. This option controls whether the space for packed ints
  should be rounded up for better performance. This option only applies for docvalues types bytes fixed sorted
  and bytes var sorted. (Simon Willnauer, Martijn van Groningen)
  
* LUCENE-3795: Replace contrib/spatial with modules/spatial.  This includes 
  a basic spatial strategy interface.  (David Smiley, Chris Male, ryan)
    
* LUCENE-3932: Lucene3x codec loads terms index faster, by
  pre-allocating the packed ints array based on the .tii file size
  (Sean Bridges via Mike McCandless)

* LUCENE-3468: Replaced last() and remove() with pollLast() in
  FirstPassGroupingCollector (Martijn van Groningen)

* LUCENE-3830: Changed MappingCharFilter/NormalizeCharMap to use an
  FST under the hood, which requires less RAM.  NormalizeCharMap no
  longer accepts empty string match (it did previously, but ignored
  it).  (Dawid Weiss, Mike McCandless)

* LUCENE-4061: improve synchronization in DirectoryTaxonomyWriter.addCategory
  and few general improvements to DirectoryTaxonomyWriter.
  (Shai Erera, Gilad Barkai)

* LUCENE-4062: Add new aligned packed bits impls for faster lookup
  performance; add float acceptableOverheadRatio to getWriter and
  getMutable API to give packed ints freedom to pick faster
  implementations (Adrien Grand via Mike McCandless)

* LUCENE-2357: Reduce transient RAM usage when merging segments in
  IndexWriter. (Adrien Grand)

* LUCENE-4098: Add bulk get/set methods to PackedInts (Adrien Grand
  via Mike McCandless)
  
* LUCENE-4156: DirectoryTaxonomyWriter.getSize is no longer synchronized.
  (Shai Erera, Sivan Yogev)

* LUCENE-4163: Improve concurrency of MMapIndexInput.clone() by using
  the new WeakIdentityMap on top of a ConcurrentHashMap to manage
  the cloned instances. WeakIdentityMap was extended to support
  iterating over its keys.  (Uwe Schindler)

Bug fixes

* LUCENE-2803: The FieldCache can miss values if an entry for a reader
  with more document deletions is requested before a reader with fewer
  deletions, provided they share some segments. (yonik)

* LUCENE-2645: Fix false assertion error when same token was added one
  after another with 0 posIncr.  (David Smiley, Kurosaka Teruhiko via Mike
  McCandless)

* LUCENE-3348: Fix thread safety hazards in IndexWriter that could
  rarely cause deletions to be incorrectly applied.  (Yonik Seeley,
  Simon Willnauer, Mike McCandless)

* LUCENE-3515: Fix terrible merge performance versus 3.x, especially
  when the directory isn't MMapDirectory, due to failing to reuse
  DocsAndPositionsEnum while merging (Marc Sturlese, Erick Erickson,
  Robert Muir, Simon Willnauer, Mike McCandless)

* LUCENE-3589: BytesRef copy(short) didn't set length.
  (Peter Chang via Robert Muir)

* LUCENE-3045: fixed QueryNodeImpl.containsTag(String key) that was
  not lowercasing the key before checking for the tag (Adriano Crestani)

* LUCENE-3890: Fixed NPE for grouped faceting on multi-valued fields.
  (Michael McCandless, Martijn van Groningen)

* LUCENE-2945: Fix hashCode/equals for surround query parser generated queries.
  (Paul Elschot, Simon Rosenthal, gsingers via ehatcher)

* LUCENE-3971: MappingCharFilter could return invalid final token position.
  (Dawid Weiss, Robert Muir)

* LUCENE-3820: PatternReplaceCharFilter could return invalid token positions. 
  (Dawid Weiss)

* LUCENE-3969: Throw IAE on bad arguments that could cause confusing errors in
  CompoundWordTokenFilterBase, PatternTokenizer, PositionFilter,
  SnowballFilter, PathHierarchyTokenizer, ReversePathHierarchyTokenizer, 
  WikipediaTokenizer, and KeywordTokenizer. ShingleFilter and 
  CommonGramsFilter now populate PositionLengthAttribute. Fixed
  PathHierarchyTokenizer to reset() all state. Protect against AIOOBE in
  ReversePathHierarchyTokenizer if skip is large. Fixed wrong final
  offset calculation in PathHierarchyTokenizer. 
  (Mike McCandless, Uwe Schindler, Robert Muir)

* LUCENE-4060: Fix a synchronization bug in 
  DirectoryTaxonomyWriter.addTaxonomies(). Also, the method has been renamed to
  addTaxonomy and now takes only one Directory and one OrdinalMap.
  (Shai Erera, Gilad Barkai)

* LUCENE-3590: Fix AIOOBE in BytesRef/CharsRef copyBytes/copyChars when 
  offset is nonzero, fix off-by-one in CharsRef.subSequence, and fix
  CharsRef's CharSequence methods to throw exceptions in boundary cases
  to properly meet the specification.  (Robert Muir)

* LUCENE-4084: Attempting to reuse a single IndexWriterConfig instance
  across more than one IndexWriter resulted in a cryptic exception.
  This is now fixed, but requires that certain members of
  IndexWriterConfig (MergePolicy, FlushPolicy,
  DocumentsWriterThreadPool) implement clone.  (Robert Muir, Simon
  Willnauer, Mike McCandless)

* LUCENE-4079: Fixed loading of Hunspell dictionaries that use aliasing (AF rules)
  (Ludovic Boutros via Chris Male)

* LUCENE-4077: Expose the max score and per-group scores from
  ToParentBlockJoinCollector (Christoph Kaser, Mike McCandless)

* LUCENE-4114: Fix int overflow bugs in BYTES_FIXED_STRAIGHT and
  BYTES_FIXED_DEREF doc values implementations (Walt Elder via Mike McCandless).

* LUCENE-4147: Fixed thread safety issues when rollback() and commit()
  are called simultaneously.  (Simon Willnauer, Mike McCandless)

* LUCENE-4165: Removed closing of the Reader used to read the affix file in
  HunspellDictionary.  Consumers are now responsible for closing all InputStreams
  once the Dictionary has been instantiated. (Torsten Krah, Uwe Schindler, Chris Male)

Documentation

* LUCENE-3958: Javadocs corrections for IndexWriter.
  (Iulius Curt via Robert Muir)

Build

* LUCENE-4047: Cleanup of LuceneTestCase: moved blocks of initialization/ cleanup
  code into JUnit instance and class rules. (Dawid Weiss)

* LUCENE-4016: Require ANT 1.8.2+ for the build. 

* LUCENE-3808: Refactoring of testing infrastructure to use randomizedtesting
  package: http://labs.carrotsearch.com/randomizedtesting.html (Dawid Weiss)

* LUCENE-3964: Added target stage-maven-artifacts, which stages
  Maven release artifacts to a Maven staging repository in preparation
  for release.  (Steve Rowe)

* LUCENE-2845: Moved contrib/benchmark to lucene/benchmark.

* LUCENE-2995: Moved contrib/spellchecker into lucene/suggest.

* LUCENE-3285: Moved contrib/queryparser into lucene/queryparser

* LUCENE-3285: Moved contrib/xml-query-parser's demo into lucene/demo

* LUCENE-3271: Moved contrib/queries BooleanFilter, BoostingQuery, 
  ChainedFilter, FilterClause and TermsFilter into lucene/queries

* LUCENE-3381: Moved contrib/queries regex.*, DuplicateFilter,
  FuzzyLikeThisQuery and SlowCollated* into lucene/sandbox.
  Removed contrib/queries.

* LUCENE-3286: Moved remainder of contrib/xml-query-parser to lucene/queryparser.
  Classes now found at org.apache.lucene.queryparser.xml.*

* LUCENE-4059: Improve ANT task prepare-webpages (used by documentation
  tasks) to correctly encode build file names as URIs for later processing by
  XSL.  (Greg Bowyer, Uwe Schindler)


======================= Lucene 3.6.2 =======================

Bug Fixes

* LUCENE-4234: Exception when FacetsCollector is used with ScoreFacetRequest,
  and the number of matching documents is too large. (Gilad Barkai via Shai Erera)

* LUCENE-2686, LUCENE-3505, LUCENE-4401: Fix BooleanQuery scorers to
  return correct freq().
  (Koji Sekiguchi, Mike McCandless, Liu Chao, Robert Muir)

* LUCENE-2501: Fixed rare thread-safety issue that could cause
  ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException inside ByteBlockPool (Robert Muir,
  Mike McCandless)

* LUCENE-4297: BooleanScorer2 would multiply the coord() factor
  twice for conjunctions: for most users this is no problem, but
  if you had a customized Similarity that returned something other
  than 1 when overlap == maxOverlap (always the case for conjunctions),
  then the score would be incorrect.  (Pascal Chollet, Robert Muir)

* LUCENE-4300: BooleanQuery's rewrite was not always safe: if you
  had a custom Similarity where coord(1,1) != 1F, then the rewritten
  query would be scored differently.  (Robert Muir)

* LUCENE-4398: If you index many different field names in your
  documents then due to a bug in how it measures its RAM
  usage, IndexWriter would flush each segment too early eventually
  reaching the point where it flushes after every doc.  (Tim Smith via
  Mike McCandless)

* LUCENE-4411: when sampling is enabled for a FacetRequest, its depth
  parameter is reset to the default (1), even if set otherwise.
  (Gilad Barkai via Shai Erera)

* LUCENE-4635: Fixed ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException when in-memory
  terms index requires more than 2.1 GB RAM (indices with billions of
  terms).  (Tom Burton-West via Mike McCandless)

Documentation

* LUCENE-4302: Fix facet userguide to have HTML loose doctype like
  all other javadocs.  (Karl Nicholas via Uwe Schindler)

  public, otherwise it's impossible to implement Scorers outside
  the Lucene package.  (Uwe Schindler)

Optimizations

* LUCENE-4163: Improve concurrency of MMapIndexInput.clone() by using
  the new WeakIdentityMap on top of a ConcurrentHashMap to manage

More information about this release, including any errata related to the 
release notes, upgrade instructions, or other changes may be found online at:
   https://wiki.apache.org/lucene-java/Lucene3.6

Changes in backwards compatibility policy

* LUCENE-3594: The protected inner class (never intended to be visible)
  FieldCacheTermsFilter.FieldCacheTermsFilterDocIdSet was removed and
  replaced by another internal implementation.  (Uwe Schindler)

* LUCENE-3620: FilterIndexReader now overrides all methods of IndexReader that 
  it should (note that some are still not overridden, as they should be 
  overridden by sub-classes only). In the process, some methods of IndexReader 
  were made final. This is not expected to affect many apps, since these methods
  already delegate to abstract methods, which you had to already override 
  anyway. (Shai Erera)

* LUCENE-3636: Added SearcherFactory, used by SearcherManager and NRTManager
  to create new IndexSearchers. You can provide your own implementation to
  warm new searchers, set an ExecutorService, set a custom Similarity, or
  even return your own subclass of IndexSearcher. The SearcherWarmer and
  ExecutorService parameters on these classes were removed, as they are
  subsumed by SearcherFactory.  (Shai Erera, Mike McCandless, Robert Muir)

* LUCENE-3644: The expert ReaderFinishedListener api suffered problems (propagated
  down to subreaders, but was not called on SegmentReaders, unless they were
  the owner of the reader core, and other ambiguities). The API is revised:
  You can set ReaderClosedListeners on any IndexReader, and onClose is called
  when that reader is closed.  SegmentReader has CoreClosedListeners that you
  can register to know when a shared reader core is closed.  
  (Uwe Schindler, Mike McCandless, Robert Muir)

* LUCENE-3652: The package org.apache.lucene.messages was moved to
  contrib/queryparser. If you have used those classes in your code
  just add the lucene-queryparser.jar file to your classpath.
  (Uwe Schindler)

* LUCENE-3681: FST now stores labels for BYTE2 input type as 2 bytes
  instead of vInt; this can make FSTs smaller and faster, but it is a
  break in the binary format so if you had built and saved any FSTs
  then you need to rebuild them. (Robert Muir, Mike McCandless)

* LUCENE-3679: The expert IndexReader.getFieldNames(FieldOption) API
  has been removed and replaced with the experimental getFieldInfos
  API.  All IndexReader subclasses must implement getFieldInfos.
  (Mike McCandless)

* LUCENE-3695: Move confusing add(X) methods out of FST.Builder into
  FST.Util.  (Robert Muir, Mike McCandless)

* LUCENE-3701: Added an additional argument to the expert FST.Builder
  ctor to take FreezeTail, which you can use to (very-expertly) customize
  the FST construction process. Pass null if you want the default
  behavior.  Added seekExact() to FSTEnum, and added FST.save/read 
  from a File. (Mike McCandless, Dawid Weiss, Robert Muir)
  
* LUCENE-3712: Removed unused and untested ReaderUtil#subReader methods.
  (Uwe Schindler)
  
* LUCENE-3672: Deprecate Directory.fileModified,
  IndexCommit.getTimestamp and .getVersion and
  IndexReader.lastModified and getCurrentVersion (Andrzej Bialecki,
  Robert Muir, Mike McCandless)

* LUCENE-3760: In IndexReader/DirectoryReader, deprecate static
  methods getCurrentVersion and getCommitUserData, and non-static
  method getCommitUserData (use getIndexCommit().getUserData()
  instead).  (Ryan McKinley, Robert Muir, Mike McCandless)
  
* LUCENE-3867: Deprecate instance creation of RamUsageEstimator, instead
  the new static method sizeOf(Object) should be used. As the algorithm
  is now using Hotspot(TM) internals (reference size, header sizes,
  object alignment), the abstract o.a.l.util.MemoryModel class was
  completely removed (without replacement). The new static methods
  no longer support String intern-ness checking, interned strings
  now count to memory usage as any other Java object.
  (Dawid Weiss, Uwe Schindler, Shai Erera)
  
* LUCENE-3738: All readXxx methods in BufferedIndexInput were made
  final. Subclasses should only override protected readInternal /
  seekInternal.  (Uwe Schindler)

* LUCENE-2599: Deprecated the spatial contrib module, which was buggy and not
  well maintained.  Lucene 4 includes a new spatial module that replaces this.
  (David Smiley, Ryan McKinley, Chris Male)
  
Changes in Runtime Behavior

* LUCENE-3796, SOLR-3241: Throw an exception if you try to set an index-time
  boost on a field that omits norms. Because the index-time boost
  is multiplied into the norm, previously your boost would be 
  silently discarded.  (Tomás Fernández Löbbe, Hoss Man, Robert Muir)

* LUCENE-3848: Fix tokenstreams to not produce a stream with an initial
  position increment of 0: which is out of bounds (overlapping with a
  non-existent previous term). Consumers such as IndexWriter and QueryParser
  still check for and silently correct this situation today, but at some point 
  in the future they may throw an exception.  (Mike McCandless, Robert Muir)
  
* LUCENE-3738: DataInput/DataOutput no longer allow negative vLongs. Negative
  vInts are still supported (for index backwards compatibility), but
  should not be used in new code. The read method for negative vLongs
  was already broken since Lucene 3.1.
  (Uwe Schindler, Mike McCandless, Robert Muir)
  
Security fixes

* LUCENE-3588: Try harder to prevent SIGSEGV on cloned MMapIndexInputs:
  Previous versions of Lucene could SIGSEGV the JVM if you try to access
  the clone of an IndexInput retrieved from MMapDirectory. This security fix
  prevents this as best as it can by throwing AlreadyClosedException
  also on clones.  (Uwe Schindler, Robert Muir)

API Changes

* LUCENE-3606: IndexReader will be made read-only in Lucene 4.0, so all
  methods allowing to delete or undelete documents using IndexReader were
  deprecated; you should use IndexWriter now. Consequently
  IndexReader.commit() and all open(), openIfChanged(), clone() methods
  taking readOnly booleans (or IndexDeletionPolicy instances) were
  deprecated. IndexReader.setNorm() is superfluous and was deprecated.
  If you have to change per-document boost use CustomScoreQuery.
  If you want to dynamically change norms (boost *and* length norm) at
  query time, wrap your IndexReader using FilterIndexReader, overriding
  FilterIndexReader.norms(). To persist the changes on disk, copy the
  FilteredIndexReader to a new index using IndexWriter.addIndexes().
  In Lucene 4.0, SimilarityProvider will allow you to customize scoring
  using external norms, too.  (Uwe Schindler, Robert Muir)

* LUCENE-3735: PayloadProcessorProvider was changed to return a
  ReaderPayloadProcessor instead of DirPayloadProcessor. The selection
  of the provider to return for the factory is now based on the IndexReader
  to be merged. To mimic the old behaviour, just use IndexReader.directory()
  for choosing the provider by Directory.  (Uwe Schindler)

* LUCENE-3765: Deprecated StopFilter ctor that took ignoreCase, because
  in some cases (if the set is a CharArraySet), the argument is ignored.
  Deprecated StandardAnalyzer and ClassicAnalyzer ctors that take File,
  please use the Reader ctor instead.  (Robert Muir)

* LUCENE-3766: Deprecate no-arg ctors of Tokenizer. Tokenizers are
  TokenStreams with Readers: tokenizers with null Readers will not be
  supported in Lucene 4.0, just use a TokenStream.  
  (Mike McCandless, Robert Muir)

* LUCENE-3769: Simplified NRTManager by requiring applyDeletes to be
  passed to ctor only; if an app needs to mix and match it's free to
  create two NRTManagers (one always applying deletes and the other
  never applying deletes).  (MJB, Shai Erera, Mike McCandless)

* LUCENE-3761: Generalize SearcherManager into an abstract ReferenceManager.
  SearcherManager remains a concrete class, but due to the refactoring, the 
  method maybeReopen has been deprecated in favor of maybeRefresh().
  (Shai Erera, Mike McCandless, Simon Willnauer)

* LUCENE-3776: You now acquire/release the IndexSearcher directly from
  NRTManager.  (Mike McCandless)
  
New Features

* LUCENE-3593: Added a FieldValueFilter that accepts all documents that either
  have at least one or no value at all in a specific field. (Simon Willnauer,
  Uwe Schindler, Robert Muir)

* LUCENE-3586: CheckIndex and IndexUpgrader allow you to specify the
  specific FSDirectory implementation to use (with the new -dir-impl
  command-line option).  (Luca Cavanna via Mike McCandless)

* LUCENE-3634: IndexReader's static main method was moved to a new
  tool, CompoundFileExtractor, in contrib/misc.  (Robert Muir, Mike
  McCandless)

* LUCENE-995: The QueryParser now interprets * as an open end for range
  queries.  Literal asterisks may be represented by quoting or escaping
  (i.e. \* or "*")  Custom QueryParser subclasses overriding getRangeQuery()
  will be passed null for any open endpoint. (Ingo Renner, Adriano
  Crestani, yonik, Mike McCandless 

* LUCENE-3121: Add sugar reverse lookup (given an output, find the
  input mapping to it) for FSTs that have strictly monotonic long
  outputs (such as an ord).  (Mike McCandless)
  
* LUCENE-3671: Add TypeTokenFilter that filters tokens based on
  their TypeAttribute.  (Tommaso Teofili via Uwe Schindler)

* LUCENE-3690,LUCENE-3913: Added HTMLStripCharFilter, a CharFilter that strips
  HTML markup. (Steve Rowe)

* LUCENE-3725: Added optional packing to FST building; this uses extra
  RAM during building but results in a smaller FST.  (Mike McCandless)

* LUCENE-3714: Add top N shortest cost paths search for FST.
  (Robert Muir, Dawid Weiss, Mike McCandless)

* LUCENE-3789: Expose MTQ TermsEnum via RewriteMethod for non package private
  access (Simon Willnauer)
  
* LUCENE-3881: Added UAX29URLEmailAnalyzer: a standard analyzer that recognizes
  URLs and emails. (Steve Rowe)

Bug fixes

* LUCENE-3595: Fixed FieldCacheRangeFilter and FieldCacheTermsFilter
  to correctly respect deletions on reopened SegmentReaders. Factored out
  FieldCacheDocIdSet to be a top-level class.  (Uwe Schindler, Simon Willnauer)

* LUCENE-3627: Don't let an errant 0-byte segments_N file corrupt the index.
  (Ken McCracken via Mike McCandless)

* LUCENE-3630: The internal method MultiReader.doOpenIfChanged(boolean doClone)
  was overriding IndexReader.doOpenIfChanged(boolean readOnly), so changing the
  contract of the overridden method. This method was renamed and made private.
  In ParallelReader the bug was not existent, but the implementation method
  was also made private.  (Uwe Schindler)

* LUCENE-3641: Fixed MultiReader to correctly propagate readerFinishedListeners
  to clones/reopened readers.  (Uwe Schindler)

* LUCENE-3642, SOLR-2891, LUCENE-3717: Fixed bugs in CharTokenizer, n-gram tokenizers/filters, 
  compound token filters, thai word filter, icutokenizer, pattern analyzer, 
  wikipediatokenizer, and smart chinese where they would create invalid offsets in 
  some situations, leading to problems in highlighting.  
  (Max Beutel, Edwin Steiner via Robert Muir)

* LUCENE-3639: TopDocs.merge was incorrectly setting TopDocs.maxScore to
  Float.MIN_VALUE when it should be Float.NaN, when there were 0
  hits.  Improved age calculation in SearcherLifetimeManager, to have
  double precision and to compute age to be how long ago the searcher
  was replaced with a new searcher (Mike McCandless)

* LUCENE-3658: Corrected potential concurrency issues with
  NRTCachingDir, fixed createOutput to overwrite any previous file,
  and removed invalid asserts (Robert Muir, Mike McCandless)

* LUCENE-3605: don't sleep in a retry loop when trying to locate the
  segments_N file (Robert Muir, Mike McCandless)

* LUCENE-3711: SentinelIntSet with a small initial size can go into
  an infinite loop when expanded.  This can affect grouping using
  TermAllGroupsCollector or TermAllGroupHeadsCollector if instantiated with a
  non default small size. (Martijn van Groningen, yonik)

* LUCENE-3727: When writing stored fields and term vectors, Lucene
  checks file sizes to detect a bug in some Sun JREs (LUCENE-1282),
  however, on some NFS filesystems File.length() could be stale,
  resulting in false errors like "fdx size mismatch while indexing".
  These checks now use getFilePointer instead to avoid this.
  (Jamir Shaikh, Mike McCandless, Robert Muir)

* LUCENE-3816: Fixed problem in FilteredDocIdSet, if null was returned
  from the delegate DocIdSet.iterator(), which is allowed to return
  null by DocIdSet specification when no documents match.
  (Shay Banon via Uwe Schindler)
  
* LUCENE-3821: SloppyPhraseScorer missed documents that ExactPhraseScorer finds
  When phrase query had repeating terms (e.g. "yes no yes")  
  sloppy query missed documents that exact query matched. 
  Fixed except when for repeating multiterms (e.g. "yes no yes|no").
  (Robert Muir, Doron Cohen)

* LUCENE-3841: Fix CloseableThreadLocal to also purge stale entries on
  get(); this fixes certain cases where we were holding onto objects
  for dead threads for too long (Matthew Bellew, Mike McCandless)

* LUCENE-3872: IndexWriter.close() now throws IllegalStateException if
  you call it after calling prepareCommit() without calling commit()
  first.  (Tim Bogaert via Mike McCandless)

* LUCENE-3874: Throw IllegalArgumentException from IndexWriter (rather
  than producing a corrupt index), if a positionIncrement would cause
  integer overflow. This can happen, for example when using a buggy
  TokenStream that forgets to call clearAttributes() in combination
  with a StopFilter. (Robert Muir)

* LUCENE-3876: Fix bug where positions for a document exceeding
  Integer.MAX_VALUE/2 would produce a corrupt index.  
  (Simon Willnauer, Mike McCandless, Robert Muir)

* LUCENE-3880: UAX29URLEmailTokenizer now recognizes emails when the mailto:
  scheme is prepended. (Kai Gülzau, Steve Rowe)
    
Optimizations

* LUCENE-3653: Improve concurrency in VirtualMethod and AttributeSource by
  using a WeakIdentityMap based on a ConcurrentHashMap.  (Uwe Schindler,
  Gerrit Jansen van Vuuren)

Documentation

* LUCENE-3597: Fixed incorrect grouping documentation. (Martijn van Groningen,
  Robert Muir)

* LUCENE-3926: Improve documentation of RAMDirectory, because this
  class is not intended to work with huge indexes. Everything beyond
  several hundred megabytes will waste resources (GC cycles), because
  it uses an internal buffer size of 1024 bytes, producing millions of 
  byte[1024] arrays. This class is optimized for small memory-resident
  indexes. It also has bad concurrency on multithreaded environments.
  It is recommended to materialize large indexes on disk and use
  MMapDirectory, which is a high-performance directory implementation
  working directly on the file system cache of the operating system,
  so copying data to Java heap space is not useful.  (Uwe Schindler,
  Mike McCandless, Robert Muir)

Build

* LUCENE-3857: exceptions from other threads in beforeclass/etc do not fail 
  the test (Dawid Weiss)

* LUCENE-3847: LuceneTestCase will now check for modifications of System 
  properties before and after each test (and suite). If changes are detected,
  the test will fail. A rule can be used to reset system properties to
  before-scope state (and this has been used to make Solr tests pass).
  (Dawid Weiss, Uwe Schindler).

* LUCENE-3228: Stop downloading external javadoc package-list files:

  - Added package-list files for Oracle Java javadocs and JUnit javadocs to
    Lucene/Solr subversion.

  - The Oracle Java javadocs package-list file is excluded from Lucene and
    Solr source release packages.

  - Regardless of network connectivity, javadocs built from a subversion
    checkout contain links to Oracle & JUnit javadocs.

  - Building javadocs from a source release package will download the Oracle
    Java package-list file if it isn't already present.

  - When the Oracle Java package-list file is not present and download fails,
    the javadocs targets will not fail the build, though an error will appear
    in the build log.  In this case, the built javadocs will not contain links
    to Oracle Java javadocs.

  - Links from Solr javadocs to Lucene's javadocs are enabled. When building
    a X.Y.Z-SNAPSHOT version, the links are to the most recently built nightly
    Jenkins javadocs. When building a release version, links are to the
    Lucene release javadocs for the same version.

  (Steve Rowe, hossman)

* LUCENE-3753: Restructure the Lucene build system:
  - Created a new Lucene-internal module named "core" by moving the java/
    and test/ directories from lucene/src/ to lucene/core/src/.
  - Eliminated lucene/src/ by moving all its directories up one level.
  - Each internal module (core/, test-framework/, and tools/) now has its own
    build.xml, from which it is possible to run module-specific targets.
    lucene/build.xml delegates all build tasks (via
    <ant dir="internal-module-dir"> calls) to these modules' build.xml files.
  (Steve Rowe)

* LUCENE-3774: Optimized and streamlined license and notice file validation
  by refactoring the build task into an ANT task and modifying build scripts
  to perform top-level checks. (Dawid Weiss, Steve Rowe, Robert Muir)

* LUCENE-3762: Upgrade JUnit to 4.10, refactor state-machine of detecting 
  setUp/tearDown call chaining in LuceneTestCase. (Dawid Weiss, Robert Muir)

* LUCENE-3944: Make the 'generate-maven-artifacts' target use filtered POMs
  placed under lucene/build/poms/, rather than in each module's base
  directory.  The 'clean' target now removes them.
  (Steve Rowe, Robert Muir)

* LUCENE-3930: Changed build system to use Apache Ivy for retrival of 3rd
  party JAR files.  Please review BUILD.txt for instructions.
  (Robert Muir, Chris Male, Uwe Schindler, Steven Rowe, Hossman)


======================= Lucene 3.5.0 =======================

Changes in backwards compatibility policy

* LUCENE-3390: The first approach in Lucene 3.4.0 for missing values
  support for sorting had a design problem that made the missing value
  be populated directly into the FieldCache arrays during sorting,
  leading to concurrency issues. To fix this behaviour, the method
  signatures had to be changed:
  - FieldCache.getUnValuedDocs() was renamed to FieldCache.getDocsWithField()
    returning a Bits interface (backported from Lucene 4.0).
  - FieldComparator.setMissingValue() was removed and added to
    constructor
  As this is expert API, most code will not be affected.
  (Uwe Schindler, Doron Cohen, Mike McCandless)

* LUCENE-3541: Remove IndexInput's protected copyBuf. If you want to
  keep a buffer in your IndexInput, do this yourself in your implementation, 
  and be sure to do the right thing on clone()!  (Robert Muir)
  
* LUCENE-2822: TimeLimitingCollector now expects a counter clock instead of
  relying on a private daemon thread. The global time limiting clock thread
  has been exposed and is now lazily loaded and fully optional.
  TimeLimitingCollector now supports setting clock baseline manually to include
  prelude of a search. Previous versions set the baseline on construction time, 
  now baseline is set once the first IndexReader is passed to the collector
  unless set before. (Simon Willnauer)

Changes in runtime behavior

* LUCENE-3520: IndexReader.openIfChanged, when passed a near-real-time
  reader, will now return null if there are no changes.  The API has
  always reserved the right to do this; it's just that in the past for
  near-real-time readers it never did. (Mike McCandless)

Bug fixes

* LUCENE-3412: SloppyPhraseScorer was returning non-deterministic results 
  for queries with many repeats (Doron Cohen)

* LUCENE-3421: PayloadTermQuery's explain was wrong when includeSpanScore=false.
  (Edward Drapkin via Robert Muir)

* LUCENE-3432: IndexWriter.expungeDeletes with TieredMergePolicy
  should ignore the maxMergedSegmentMB setting (v.sevel via Mike
  McCandless)
  
* LUCENE-3442: TermQuery.TermWeight.scorer() returns null for non-atomic
  IndexReaders (optimization bug, introcuced by LUCENE-2829), preventing
  QueryWrapperFilter and similar classes to get a top-level DocIdSet.
  (Dan C., Uwe Schindler)

* LUCENE-3390: Corrected handling of missing values when two parallel searches
  using different missing values for sorting: the missing value was populated
  directly into the FieldCache arrays during sorting, leading to concurrency
  issues.  (Uwe Schindler, Doron Cohen, Mike McCandless)

* LUCENE-3439: Closing an NRT reader after the writer was closed was
  incorrectly invoking the DeletionPolicy and (then possibly deleting
  files) on the closed IndexWriter (Robert Muir, Mike McCandless)

* LUCENE-3215: SloppyPhraseScorer sometimes computed Infinite freq
  (Robert Muir, Doron Cohen)  

* LUCENE-3503: DisjunctionSumScorer would give slightly different scores
  for a document depending if you used nextDoc() versus advance().
  (Mike McCandless, Robert Muir)

* LUCENE-3529: Properly support indexing an empty field with empty term text.
  Previously, if you had assertions enabled you would receive an error during
  flush, if you didn't, you would get an invalid index.  
  (Mike McCandless, Robert Muir)

* LUCENE-2633: PackedInts Packed32 and Packed64 did not support internal
  structures larger than 256MB (Toke Eskildsen via Mike McCandless)

* LUCENE-3540: LUCENE-3255 dropped support for pre-1.9 indexes, but the
  error message in IndexFormatTooOldException was incorrect. (Uwe Schindler,
  Mike McCandless)

* LUCENE-3541: IndexInput's default copyBytes() implementation was not safe 
  across multiple threads, because all clones shared the same buffer.
  (Robert Muir)
  
* LUCENE-3548: Fix CharsRef#append to extend length of the existing char[]
  and preserve existing chars. (Simon Willnauer) 

* LUCENE-3582: Normalize NaN values in NumericUtils.floatToSortableInt() /
  NumericUtils.doubleToSortableLong(), so this is consistent with stored
  fields. Also fix NumericRangeQuery to not falsely hit NaNs on half-open
  ranges (one bound is null). Because of normalization, NumericRangeQuery
  can now be used to hit NaN values by creating a query with
  upper == lower == NaN (inclusive).  (Dawid Weiss, Uwe Schindler)

API Changes

* LUCENE-3454: Rename IndexWriter.optimize to forceMerge to discourage
  use of this method since it is horribly costly and rarely justified
  anymore.  MergePolicy.findMergesForOptimize was renamed to
  findForcedMerges.  IndexReader.isOptimized was
  deprecated. IndexCommit.isOptimized was replaced with
  getSegmentCount. (Robert Muir, Mike McCandless)

* LUCENE-3205: Deprecated MultiTermQuery.getTotalNumerOfTerms() [and
  related methods], as the numbers returned are not useful
  for multi-segment indexes. They were only needed for tests of
  NumericRangeQuery.  (Mike McCandless, Uwe Schindler)

* LUCENE-3574: Deprecate outdated constants in org.apache.lucene.util.Constants
  and add new ones for Java 6 and Java 7.  (Uwe Schindler)

* LUCENE-3571: Deprecate IndexSearcher(Directory). Use the constructors
  that take IndexReader instead.  (Robert Muir)

* LUCENE-3577: Rename IndexWriter.expungeDeletes to forceMergeDeletes,
  and revamped the javadocs, to discourage
  use of this method since it is horribly costly and rarely
  justified.  MergePolicy.findMergesToExpungeDeletes was renamed to
  findForcedDeletesMerges. (Robert Muir, Mike McCandless)

* LUCENE-3464: IndexReader.reopen has been renamed to
  IndexReader.openIfChanged (a static method), and now returns null
  (instead of the old reader) if there are no changes in the index, to
  prevent the common pitfall of accidentally closing the old reader.

New Features

* LUCENE-3448: Added FixedBitSet.and(other/DISI), andNot(other/DISI).
  (Uwe Schindler)

* LUCENE-2215: Added IndexSearcher.searchAfter which returns results after a 
  specified ScoreDoc (e.g. last document on the previous page) to support deep
  paging use cases.  (Aaron McCurry, Grant Ingersoll, Robert Muir) 

* LUCENE-1990: Adds internal packed ints implementation, to be used
  for more efficient storage of int arrays when the values are
  bounded, for example for storing the terms dict index (Toke
  Eskildsen via Mike McCandless)
  
* LUCENE-3558: Moved SearcherManager, NRTManager & SearcherLifetimeManager into
  core. All classes are contained in o.a.l.search. (Simon Willnauer)

Optimizations

* LUCENE-3426: Add NGramPhraseQuery which extends PhraseQuery and tries to 
  reduce the number of terms of the query when rewrite(), in order to improve 
  performance.  (Robert Muir, Koji Sekiguchi)
  
* LUCENE-3494: Optimize FilteredQuery to remove a multiply in score()
  (Uwe Schindler, Robert Muir)

* LUCENE-3534: Remove filter logic from IndexSearcher and delegate to
  FilteredQuery's Scorer. This is a partial backport of a cleanup in
  FilteredQuery/IndexSearcher added by LUCENE-1536 to Lucene 4.0.
  (Uwe Schindler)

* LUCENE-2205: Very substantial (3-5X) RAM reduction required to hold
  the terms index on opening an IndexReader (Aaron McCurry via Mike McCandless)

* LUCENE-3443: FieldCache can now set docsWithField, and create an
  array, in a single pass.  This results in faster init time for apps
  that need both (such as sorting by a field with a missing value).
  (Mike McCandless)

Test Cases

* LUCENE-3420: Disable the finalness checks in TokenStream and Analyzer
  for implementing subclasses in different packages, where assertions are not
  enabled. (Uwe Schindler)

* LUCENE-3506: tests relying on assertions being enabled were no-op because
  they ignored AssertionError. With this fix now entire test framework 
  (every test) fails if assertions are disabled, unless 
  -Dtests.asserts.gracious=true is specified. (Doron Cohen)

Build

* SOLR-2849: Fix dependencies in Maven POMs. (David Smiley via Steve Rowe)

* LUCENE-3561: Fix maven xxx-src.jar files that were missing resources.
  (Uwe Schindler)

======================= Lucene 3.4.0 =======================

Bug fixes

* LUCENE-3251: Directory#copy failed to close target output if opening the
  source stream failed. (Simon Willnauer)

* LUCENE-3255: If segments_N file is all zeros (due to file
  corruption), don't read that to mean the index is empty.  (Gregory
  Tarr, Mark Harwood, Simon Willnauer, Mike McCandless)

* LUCENE-3254: Fixed minor bug in deletes were written to disk,
  causing the file to sometimes be larger than it needed to be.  (Mike
  McCandless)

* LUCENE-3224: Fixed a big where CheckIndex would incorrectly report a
  corrupt index if a term with docfreq >= 16 was indexed more than once
  at the same position.  (Robert Muir)

* LUCENE-3339: Fixed deadlock case when multiple threads use the new
  block-add (IndexWriter.add/updateDocuments) methods.  (Robert Muir,
  Mike McCandless)

* LUCENE-3340: Fixed case where IndexWriter was not flushing at
  exactly maxBufferedDeleteTerms (Mike McCandless)

* LUCENE-3358, LUCENE-3361: StandardTokenizer and UAX29URLEmailTokenizer 
  wrongly discarded combining marks attached to Han or Hiragana characters, 
  this is fixed if you supply Version >= 3.4 If you supply a previous 
  lucene version, you get the old buggy behavior for backwards compatibility.  
  (Trejkaz, Robert Muir)

* LUCENE-3368: IndexWriter commits segments without applying their buffered
  deletes when flushing concurrently. (Simon Willnauer, Mike McCandless)
  
* LUCENE-3365: Create or Append mode determined before obtaining write lock
  can cause IndexWriter overriding an existing index.
  (Geoff Cooney via Simon Willnauer)

* LUCENE-3380: Fixed a bug where FileSwitchDirectory's listAll() would wrongly
  throw NoSuchDirectoryException when all files written so far have been
  written to one directory, but the other still has not yet been created on the
  filesystem.  (Robert Muir)

* LUCENE-3409: IndexWriter.deleteAll was failing to close pooled NRT
  SegmentReaders, leading to unused files accumulating in the
  Directory.  (tal steier via Mike McCandless)

* LUCENE-3418: Lucene was failing to fsync index files on commit,
  meaning an operating system or hardware crash, or power loss, could
  easily corrupt the index.  (Mark Miller, Robert Muir, Mike
  McCandless)
  
New Features

* LUCENE-3290: Added FieldInvertState.numUniqueTerms 
  (Mike McCandless, Robert Muir)

* LUCENE-3280: Add FixedBitSet, like OpenBitSet but is not elastic
  (grow on demand if you set/get/clear too-large indices).  (Mike
  McCandless)

* LUCENE-2048: Added the ability to omit positions but still index
  term frequencies, you can now control what is indexed into
  the postings via AbstractField.setIndexOptions:
   DOCS_ONLY: only documents are indexed: term frequencies and positions are omitted
   DOCS_AND_FREQS: only documents and term frequencies are indexed: positions are omitted
   DOCS_AND_FREQS_AND_POSITIONS: full postings: documents, frequencies, and positions
  AbstractField.setOmitTermFrequenciesAndPositions is deprecated,
  you should use DOCS_ONLY instead.  (Robert Muir)

* LUCENE-3097: Added a new grouping collector that can be used to retrieve all most relevant
  documents per group. This can be useful in situations when one wants to compute grouping
  based facets / statistics on the complete query result. (Martijn van Groningen)

* LUCENE-3334: If Java7 is detected, IOUtils.closeSafely() will log
  suppressed exceptions in the original exception, so stack trace
  will contain them.  (Uwe Schindler)

Optimizations

* LUCENE-3201, LUCENE-3218: CompoundFileSystem code has been consolidated 
  into a Directory implementation. Reading is optimized for MMapDirectory,
  NIOFSDirectory and SimpleFSDirectory to only map requested parts of the
  CFS into an IndexInput. Writing to a CFS now tries to append to the CF
  directly if possible and merges separately written files on the fly instead
  of during close. (Simon Willnauer, Robert Muir)

* LUCENE-3289: When building an FST you can now tune how aggressively
  the FST should try to share common suffixes.  Typically you can
  greatly reduce RAM required during building, and CPU consumed, at
  the cost of a somewhat larger FST.  (Mike McCandless)

Test Cases

* LUCENE-3327: Fix AIOOBE when TestFSTs is run with
  -Dtests.verbose=true (James Dyer via Mike McCandless)

Build

* LUCENE-3406: Add ant target 'package-local-src-tgz' to Lucene and Solr
  to package sources from the local working copy.
  (Seung-Yeoul Yang via Steve Rowe)


======================= Lucene 3.3.0 =======================

Changes in backwards compatibility policy

* LUCENE-3140: IndexOutput.copyBytes now takes a DataInput (superclass
  of IndexInput) as its first argument.  (Robert Muir, Dawid Weiss,
  Mike McCandless)

* LUCENE-3191: FieldComparator.value now returns an Object not
  Comparable; FieldDoc.fields also changed from Comparable[] to
  Object[] (Uwe Schindler, Mike McCandless)

* LUCENE-3208: Made deprecated methods Query.weight(Searcher) and
  Searcher.createWeight() final to prevent override. If you have
  overridden one of these methods, cut over to the non-deprecated
  implementation. (Uwe Schindler, Robert Muir, Yonik Seeley)

* LUCENE-3238: Made MultiTermQuery.rewrite() final, to prevent
  problems (such as not properly setting rewrite methods, or 
  not working correctly with things like SpanMultiTermQueryWrapper).
  To rewrite to a simpler form, instead return a simpler enum
  from getEnum(IndexReader). For example, to rewrite to a single term, 
  return a SingleTermEnum.  (ludovic Boutros, Uwe Schindler, Robert Muir)

Changes in runtime behavior

* LUCENE-2834: the hash used to compute the lock file name when the
  lock file is not stored in the index has changed.  This means you
  will see a different lucene-XXX-write.lock in your lock directory.
  (Robert Muir, Uwe Schindler, Mike McCandless)
  
* LUCENE-3146: IndexReader.setNorm throws IllegalStateException if the field
  does not store norms. (Shai Erera, Mike McCandless)

* LUCENE-3198: On Linux, if the JRE is 64 bit and supports unmapping,
  FSDirectory.open now defaults to MMapDirectory instead of
  NIOFSDirectory since MMapDirectory gives better performance.  (Mike
  McCandless)
  
* LUCENE-3200: MMapDirectory now uses chunk sizes that are powers of 2.
  When setting the chunk size, it is rounded down to the next possible
  value. The new default value for 64 bit platforms is 2^30 (1 GiB),
  for 32 bit platforms it stays unchanged at 2^28 (256 MiB).
  Internally, MMapDirectory now only uses one dedicated final IndexInput
  implementation supporting multiple chunks, which makes Hotspot's life
  easier.  (Uwe Schindler, Robert Muir, Mike McCandless)
  
Bug fixes

* LUCENE-3147,LUCENE-3152: Fixed open file handles leaks in many places in the 
  code. Now MockDirectoryWrapper (in test-framework) tracks all open files, 
  including locks, and fails if the test fails to release all of them.
  (Mike McCandless, Robert Muir, Shai Erera, Simon Willnauer)

* LUCENE-3102: CachingCollector.replay was failing to call setScorer
  per-segment (Martijn van Groningen via Mike McCandless)

* LUCENE-3183: Fix rare corner case where seeking to empty term
  (field="", term="") with terms index interval 1 could hit
  ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException (selckin, Robert Muir, Mike
  McCandless)

* LUCENE-3208: IndexSearcher had its own private similarity field
  and corresponding get/setter overriding Searcher's implementation. If you
  setted a different Similarity instance on IndexSearcher, methods implemented
  in the superclass Searcher were not using it, leading to strange bugs.
  (Uwe Schindler, Robert Muir)

* LUCENE-3197: Fix core merge policies to not over-merge during
  background optimize when documents are still being deleted
  concurrently with the optimize (Mike McCandless)

* LUCENE-3222: The RAM accounting for buffered delete terms was
  failing to measure the space required to hold the term's field and
  text character data.  (Mike McCandless)

* LUCENE-3238: Fixed bug where using WildcardQuery("prefix*") inside
  of a SpanMultiTermQueryWrapper rewrote incorrectly and returned
  an error instead.  (ludovic Boutros, Uwe Schindler, Robert Muir)

API Changes

* LUCENE-3208: Renamed protected IndexSearcher.createWeight() to expert
  public method IndexSearcher.createNormalizedWeight() as this better describes
  what this method does. The old method is still there for backwards
  compatibility. Query.weight() was deprecated and simply delegates to
  IndexSearcher. Both deprecated methods will be removed in Lucene 4.0.
  (Uwe Schindler, Robert Muir, Yonik Seeley)

* LUCENE-3197: MergePolicy.findMergesForOptimize now takes
  Map<SegmentInfo,Boolean> instead of Set<SegmentInfo> as the second
  argument, so the merge policy knows which segments were originally
  present vs produced by an optimizing merge (Mike McCandless)

Optimizations

* LUCENE-1736: DateTools.java general improvements. 
  (David Smiley via Steve Rowe)

New Features

* LUCENE-3140: Added experimental FST implementation to Lucene.
  (Robert Muir, Dawid Weiss, Mike McCandless)

* LUCENE-3193: A new TwoPhaseCommitTool allows running a 2-phase commit 
  algorithm over objects that implement the new TwoPhaseCommit interface (such
  as IndexWriter). (Shai Erera)

* LUCENE-3191: Added TopDocs.merge, to facilitate merging results from
  different shards (Uwe Schindler, Mike McCandless)

* LUCENE-3179: Added OpenBitSet.prevSetBit (Paul Elschot via Mike McCandless)

* LUCENE-3210: Made TieredMergePolicy more aggressive in reclaiming
  segments with deletions; added new methods
  set/getReclaimDeletesWeight to control this.  (Mike McCandless)

Build

* LUCENE-1344: Create OSGi bundle using dev-tools/maven.
  (Nicolas Lalevée, Luca Stancapiano via ryan)
  
* LUCENE-3204: The maven-ant-tasks jar is now included in the source tree;
  users of the generate-maven-artifacts target no longer have to manually
  place this jar in the Ant classpath.  NOTE: when Ant looks for the 
  maven-ant-tasks jar, it looks first in its pre-existing classpath, so
  any copies it finds will be used instead of the copy included in the 
  Lucene/Solr source tree.  For this reason, it is recommeded to remove
  any copies of the maven-ant-tasks jar in the Ant classpath, e.g. under
  ~/.ant/lib/ or under the Ant installation's lib/ directory. (Steve Rowe) 
  

======================= Lucene 3.2.0 =======================

Changes in backwards compatibility policy

* LUCENE-2953: PriorityQueue's internal heap was made private, as subclassing
  with generics can lead to ClassCastException. For advanced use (e.g. in Solr)
  a method getHeapArray() was added to retrieve the internal heap array as a
  non-generic Object[].  (Uwe Schindler, Yonik Seeley)

* LUCENE-1076: IndexWriter.setInfoStream now throws IOException
  (Mike McCandless, Shai Erera)

* LUCENE-3084: MergePolicy.OneMerge.segments was changed from
  SegmentInfos to a List<SegmentInfo>. SegmentInfos itself was changed
  to no longer extend Vector<SegmentInfo> (to update code that is using
  Vector-API, use the new asList() and asSet() methods returning unmodifiable
  collections; modifying SegmentInfos is now only possible through
  the explicitely declared methods). IndexWriter.segString() now takes
  Iterable<SegmentInfo> instead of List<SegmentInfo>. A simple recompile
  should fix this. MergePolicy and SegmentInfos are internal/experimental
  APIs not covered by the strict backwards compatibility policy.
  (Uwe Schindler, Mike McCandless)

Changes in runtime behavior

* LUCENE-3065: When a NumericField is retrieved from a Document loaded
  from IndexReader (or IndexSearcher), it will now come back as
  NumericField not as a Field with a string-ified version of the
  numeric value you had indexed.  Note that this only applies for
  newly-indexed Documents; older indices will still return Field
  with the string-ified numeric value. If you call Document.get(),
  the value comes still back as String, but Document.getFieldable()
  returns NumericField instances. (Uwe Schindler, Ryan McKinley,
  Mike McCandless)

* LUCENE-1076: Changed the default merge policy from
  LogByteSizeMergePolicy to TieredMergePolicy, as of Version.LUCENE_32
  (passed to IndexWriterConfig), which is able to merge non-contiguous
  segments. This means docIDs no longer necessarily stay "in order"
  during indexing.  If this is a problem then you can use either of
  the LogMergePolicy impls.  (Mike McCandless)
  
New features

* LUCENE-3082: Added index upgrade tool oal.index.IndexUpgrader
  that allows to upgrade all segments to last recent supported index
  format without fully optimizing.  (Uwe Schindler, Mike McCandless)

* LUCENE-1076: Added TieredMergePolicy which is able to merge non-contiguous 
  segments, which means docIDs no longer necessarily stay "in order".
  (Mike McCandless, Shai Erera)

* LUCENE-3071: Adding ReversePathHierarchyTokenizer, added skip parameter to 
  PathHierarchyTokenizer (Olivier Favre via ryan)

* LUCENE-1421, LUCENE-3102: added CachingCollector which allow you to cache 
  document IDs and scores encountered during the search, and "replay" them to 
  another Collector. (Mike McCandless, Shai Erera)

* LUCENE-3112: Added experimental IndexWriter.add/updateDocuments,
  enabling a block of documents to be indexed, atomically, with
  guaranteed sequential docIDs.  (Mike McCandless)

API Changes

* LUCENE-3061: IndexWriter's getNextMerge() and merge(OneMerge) are now public
  (though @lucene.experimental), allowing for custom MergeScheduler 
  implementations. (Shai Erera)

* LUCENE-3065: Document.getField() was deprecated, as it throws
  ClassCastException when loading lazy fields or NumericFields.
  (Uwe Schindler, Ryan McKinley, Mike McCandless)

* LUCENE-2027: Directory.touchFile is deprecated and will be removed
  in 4.0.  (Mike McCandless)

Optimizations

* LUCENE-2990: ArrayUtil/CollectionUtil.*Sort() methods now exit early
  on empty or one-element lists/arrays.  (Uwe Schindler)

* LUCENE-2897: Apply deleted terms while flushing a segment.  We still
  buffer deleted terms to later apply to past segments.  (Mike McCandless)

* LUCENE-3126: IndexWriter.addIndexes copies incoming segments into CFS if they
  aren't already and MergePolicy allows that. (Shai Erera)

Bug fixes

* LUCENE-2996: addIndexes(IndexReader) did not flush before adding the new 
  indexes, causing existing deletions to be applied on the incoming indexes as 
  well. (Shai Erera, Mike McCandless)

* LUCENE-3024: Index with more than 2.1B terms was hitting AIOOBE when
  seeking TermEnum (eg used by Solr's faceting) (Tom Burton-West, Mike
  McCandless)

* LUCENE-3042: When a filter or consumer added Attributes to a TokenStream
  chain after it was already (partly) consumed [or clearAttributes(),
  captureState(), cloneAttributes(),... was called by the Tokenizer],
  the Tokenizer calling clearAttributes() or capturing state after addition 
  may not do this on the newly added Attribute. This bug affected only
  very special use cases of the TokenStream-API, most users would not
  have recognized it.  (Uwe Schindler, Robert Muir)

* LUCENE-3054: PhraseQuery can in some cases stack overflow in
  SorterTemplate.quickSort(). This fix also adds an optimization to
  PhraseQuery as term with lower doc freq will also have less positions.
  (Uwe Schindler, Robert Muir, Otis Gospodnetic)

* LUCENE-3068: sloppy phrase query failed to match valid documents when multiple 
  query terms had same position in the query. (Doron Cohen)

* LUCENE-3012: Lucene writes the header now for separate norm files (*.sNNN)
  (Robert Muir)

Build

* LUCENE-3006: Building javadocs will fail on warnings by default. 
  Override with -Dfailonjavadocwarning=false (sarowe, gsingers)

* LUCENE-3128: "ant eclipse" creates a .project file for easier Eclipse
  integration (unless one already exists). (Daniel Serodio via Shai Erera)

Test Cases

* LUCENE-3002: added 'tests.iter.min' to control 'tests.iter' by allowing to 
  stop iterating if at least 'tests.iter.min' ran and a failure occured. 
  (Shai Erera, Chris Hostetter)

======================= Lucene 3.1.0 =======================

Changes in backwards compatibility policy

* LUCENE-2719: Changed API of internal utility class
  org.apache.lucene.util.SorterTemplate to support faster quickSort using
  pivot values and also merge sort and insertion sort. If you have used
  this class, you have to implement two more methods for handling pivots.
  (Uwe Schindler, Robert Muir, Mike McCandless)

* LUCENE-1923: Renamed SegmentInfo & SegmentInfos segString method to
  toString.  These are advanced APIs and subject to change suddenly.
  (Tim Smith via Mike McCandless)

* LUCENE-2190: Removed deprecated customScore() and customExplain()
  methods from experimental CustomScoreQuery.  (Uwe Schindler)

* LUCENE-2286: Enabled DefaultSimilarity.setDiscountOverlaps by default.
  This means that terms with a position increment gap of zero do not
  affect the norms calculation by default.  (Robert Muir)

* LUCENE-2320: MergePolicy.writer is now of type SetOnce, which allows setting
  the IndexWriter for a MergePolicy exactly once. You can change references to
  'writer' from <code>writer.doXYZ()</code> to <code>writer.get().doXYZ()</code>
  (it is also advisable to add an <code>assert writer != null;</code> before you
  access the wrapped IndexWriter.)

  In addition, MergePolicy only exposes a default constructor, and the one that
  took IndexWriter as argument has been removed from all MergePolicy extensions.
  (Shai Erera via Mike McCandless)

* LUCENE-2328: SimpleFSDirectory.SimpleFSIndexInput is moved to
  FSDirectory.FSIndexInput. Anyone extending this class will have to
  fix their code on upgrading. (Earwin Burrfoot via Mike McCandless)

* LUCENE-2302: The new interface for term attributes, CharTermAttribute,
  now implements CharSequence. This requires the toString() methods of
  CharTermAttribute, deprecated TermAttribute, and Token to return only
  the term text and no other attribute contents. LUCENE-2374 implements
  an attribute reflection API to no longer rely on toString() for attribute
  inspection. (Uwe Schindler, Robert Muir)

* LUCENE-2372, LUCENE-2389: StandardAnalyzer, KeywordAnalyzer,
  PerFieldAnalyzerWrapper, WhitespaceTokenizer are now final.  Also removed
  the now obsolete and deprecated Analyzer.setOverridesTokenStreamMethod().
  Analyzer and TokenStream base classes now have an assertion in their ctor,
  that check subclasses to be final or at least have final implementations
  of incrementToken(), tokenStream(), and reusableTokenStream().
  (Uwe Schindler, Robert Muir)

* LUCENE-2316: Directory.fileLength contract was clarified - it returns the
  actual file's length if the file exists, and throws FileNotFoundException
  otherwise. Returning length=0 for a non-existent file is no longer allowed. If
  you relied on that, make sure to catch the exception. (Shai Erera)

* LUCENE-2386: IndexWriter no longer performs an empty commit upon new index
  creation. Previously, if you passed an empty Directory and set OpenMode to
  CREATE*, IndexWriter would make a first empty commit. If you need that
  behavior you can call writer.commit()/close() immediately after you create it.
  (Shai Erera, Mike McCandless)

* LUCENE-2733: Removed public constructors of utility classes with only static
  methods to prevent instantiation.  (Uwe Schindler)

* LUCENE-2602: The default (LogByteSizeMergePolicy) merge policy now
  takes deletions into account by default.  You can disable this by
  calling setCalibrateSizeByDeletes(false) on the merge policy.  (Mike
  McCandless)

* LUCENE-2529, LUCENE-2668: Position increment gap and offset gap of empty
  values in multi-valued field has been changed for some cases in index.
  If you index empty fields and uses positions/offsets information on that
  fields, reindex is recommended. (David Smiley, Koji Sekiguchi)

* LUCENE-2804: Directory.setLockFactory new declares throwing an IOException.
  (Shai Erera, Robert Muir)

* LUCENE-2837: Added deprecations noting that in 4.0, Searcher and
  Searchable are collapsed into IndexSearcher; contrib/remote and
  MultiSearcher have been removed.  (Mike McCandless)

* LUCENE-2854: Deprecated SimilarityDelegator and
  Similarity.lengthNorm; the latter is now final, forcing any custom
  Similarity impls to cutover to the more general computeNorm (Robert
  Muir, Mike McCandless)

* LUCENE-2869: Deprecated Query.getSimilarity: instead of using
  "runtime" subclassing/delegation, subclass the Weight instead.
  (Robert Muir)

* LUCENE-2674: A new idfExplain method was added to Similarity, that
  accepts an incoming docFreq.  If you subclass Similarity, make sure
  you also override this method on upgrade.  (Robert Muir, Mike
  McCandless)

Changes in runtime behavior

* LUCENE-1923: Made IndexReader.toString() produce something
  meaningful (Tim Smith via Mike McCandless)

* LUCENE-2179: CharArraySet.clear() is now functional.
  (Robert Muir, Uwe Schindler)

* LUCENE-2455: IndexWriter.addIndexes no longer optimizes the target index
  before it adds the new ones. Also, the existing segments are not merged and so
  the index will not end up with a single segment (unless it was empty before).
  In addition, addIndexesNoOptimize was renamed to addIndexes and no longer
  invokes a merge on the incoming and target segments, but instead copies the
  segments to the target index. You can call maybeMerge or optimize after this
  method completes, if you need to.

  In addition, Directory.copyTo* were removed in favor of copy which takes the
  target Directory, source and target files as arguments, and copies the source
  file to the target Directory under the target file name. (Shai Erera)

* LUCENE-2663: IndexWriter no longer forcefully clears any existing
  locks when create=true.  This was a holdover from when
  SimpleFSLockFactory was the default locking implementation, and,
  even then it was dangerous since it could mask bugs in IndexWriter's
  usage, allowing applications to accidentally open two writers on the
  same directory.  (Mike McCandless)

* LUCENE-2701: maxMergeMBForOptimize and maxMergeDocs constraints set on
  LogMergePolicy now affect optimize() as well (as opposed to only regular
  merges). This means that you can run optimize() and too large segments won't
  be merged. (Shai Erera)

* LUCENE-2753: IndexReader and DirectoryReader .listCommits() now return a List,
  guaranteeing the commits are sorted from oldest to latest. (Shai Erera)

* LUCENE-2785: TopScoreDocCollector, TopFieldCollector and
  the IndexSearcher search methods that take an int nDocs will now
  throw IllegalArgumentException if nDocs is 0.  Instead, you should
  use the newly added TotalHitCountCollector.  (Mike McCandless)

* LUCENE-2790: LogMergePolicy.useCompoundFile's logic now factors in noCFSRatio
  to determine whether the passed in segment should be compound.
  (Shai Erera, Earwin Burrfoot)

* LUCENE-2805: IndexWriter now increments the index version on every change to
  the index instead of for every commit. Committing or closing the IndexWriter
  without any changes to the index will not cause any index version increment.
  (Simon Willnauer, Mike McCandless)

* LUCENE-2650, LUCENE-2825: The behavior of FSDirectory.open has changed. On 64-bit
  Windows and Solaris systems that support unmapping, FSDirectory.open returns
  MMapDirectory. Additionally the behavior of MMapDirectory has been
  changed to enable unmapping by default if supported by the JRE.
  (Mike McCandless, Uwe Schindler, Robert Muir)

* LUCENE-2829: Improve the performance of "primary key" lookup use
  case (running a TermQuery that matches one document) on a
  multi-segment index.  (Robert Muir, Mike McCandless)

* LUCENE-2010: Segments with 100% deleted documents are now removed on
  IndexReader or IndexWriter commit.   (Uwe Schindler, Mike McCandless)

* LUCENE-2960: Allow some changes to IndexWriterConfig to take effect
  "live" (after an IW is instantiated), via
  IndexWriter.getConfig().setXXX(...) (Shay Banon, Mike McCandless)

API Changes

* LUCENE-2076: Rename FSDirectory.getFile -> getDirectory.  (George
  Aroush via Mike McCandless)

* LUCENE-1260: Change norm encode (float->byte) and decode
  (byte->float) to be instance methods not static methods.  This way a
  custom Similarity can alter how norms are encoded, though they must
  still be encoded as a single byte (Johan Kindgren via Mike
  McCandless)

* LUCENE-2103: NoLockFactory should have a private constructor;
  until Lucene 4.0 the default one will be deprecated.
  (Shai Erera via Uwe Schindler)

* LUCENE-2177: Deprecate the Field ctors that take byte[] and Store.
  Since the removal of compressed fields, Store can only be YES, so
  it's not necessary to specify.  (Erik Hatcher via Mike McCandless)

* LUCENE-2200: Several final classes had non-overriding protected
  members. These were converted to private and unused protected
  constructors removed.  (Steven Rowe via Robert Muir)

* LUCENE-2240: SimpleAnalyzer and WhitespaceAnalyzer now have
  Version ctors.  (Simon Willnauer via Uwe Schindler)

* LUCENE-2259: Add IndexWriter.deleteUnusedFiles, to attempt removing
  unused files.  This is only useful on Windows, which prevents
  deletion of open files. IndexWriter will eventually remove these
  files itself; this method just lets you do so when you know the
  files are no longer open by IndexReaders. (luocanrao via Mike
  McCandless)

* LUCENE-2282: IndexFileNames is exposed as a public class allowing for easier
  use by external code. In addition it offers a matchExtension method which
  callers can use to query whether a certain file matches a certain extension.
  (Shai Erera via Mike McCandless)

* LUCENE-124: Add a TopTermsBoostOnlyBooleanQueryRewrite to MultiTermQuery.
  This rewrite method is similar to TopTermsScoringBooleanQueryRewrite, but
  only scores terms by their boost values. For example, this can be used
  with FuzzyQuery to ensure that exact matches are always scored higher,
  because only the boost will be used in scoring.  (Robert Muir)

* LUCENE-2015: Add a static method foldToASCII to ASCIIFoldingFilter to
  expose its folding logic.  (Cédrik Lime via Robert Muir)

* LUCENE-2294: IndexWriter constructors have been deprecated in favor of a
  single ctor which accepts IndexWriterConfig and a Directory. You can set all
  the parameters related to IndexWriter on IndexWriterConfig. The different
  setter/getter methods were deprecated as well. One should call
  writer.getConfig().getXYZ() to query for a parameter XYZ.
  Additionally, the setter/getter related to MergePolicy were deprecated as
  well. One should interact with the MergePolicy directly.
  (Shai Erera via Mike McCandless)

* LUCENE-2320: IndexWriter's MergePolicy configuration was moved to
  IndexWriterConfig and the respective methods on IndexWriter were deprecated.
  (Shai Erera via Mike McCandless)

* LUCENE-2328: Directory now keeps track itself of the files that are written
  but not yet fsynced. The old Directory.sync(String file) method is deprecated
  and replaced with Directory.sync(Collection<String> files). Take a look at
  FSDirectory to see a sample of how such tracking might look like, if needed
  in your custom Directories.  (Earwin Burrfoot via Mike McCandless)

* LUCENE-2302: Deprecated TermAttribute and replaced by a new
  CharTermAttribute. The change is backwards compatible, so
  mixed new/old TokenStreams all work on the same char[] buffer
  independent of which interface they use. CharTermAttribute
  has shorter method names and implements CharSequence and
  Appendable. This allows usage like Java's StringBuilder in
  addition to direct char[] access. Also terms can directly be
  used in places where CharSequence is allowed (e.g. regular
  expressions).
  (Uwe Schindler, Robert Muir)

* LUCENE-2402: IndexWriter.deleteUnusedFiles now deletes unreferenced commit
  points too. If you use an IndexDeletionPolicy which holds onto index commits
  (such as SnapshotDeletionPolicy), you can call this method to remove those
  commit points when they are not needed anymore (instead of waiting for the
  next commit). (Shai Erera)

* LUCENE-2481: SnapshotDeletionPolicy.snapshot() and release() were replaced
  with equivalent ones that take a String (id) as argument. You can pass
  whatever ID you want, as long as you use the same one when calling both.
  (Shai Erera)

* LUCENE-2356: Add IndexWriterConfig.set/getReaderTermIndexDivisor, to
  set what IndexWriter passes for termsIndexDivisor to the readers it
  opens internally when apply deletions or creating a near-real-time
  reader.  (Earwin Burrfoot via Mike McCandless)

* LUCENE-2167,LUCENE-2699,LUCENE-2763,LUCENE-2847: StandardTokenizer/Analyzer
  in common/standard/ now implement the Word Break rules from the Unicode 6.0.0
  Text Segmentation algorithm (UAX#29), covering the full range of Unicode code
  points, including values from U+FFFF to U+10FFFF

  ClassicTokenizer/Analyzer retains the old (pre-Lucene 3.1) StandardTokenizer/
  Analyzer implementation and behavior.  Only the Unicode Basic Multilingual
  Plane (code points from U+0000 to U+FFFF) is covered.

  UAX29URLEmailTokenizer tokenizes URLs and E-mail addresses according to the
  relevant RFCs, in addition to implementing the UAX#29 Word Break rules.
  (Steven Rowe, Robert Muir, Uwe Schindler)

* LUCENE-2778: RAMDirectory now exposes newRAMFile() which allows to override
  and return a different RAMFile implementation. (Shai Erera)

* LUCENE-2785: Added TotalHitCountCollector whose sole purpose is to
  count the number of hits matching the query.  (Mike McCandless)

* LUCENE-2846: Deprecated IndexReader.setNorm(int, String, float). This method
  is only syntactic sugar for setNorm(int, String, byte), but  using the global
  Similarity.getDefault().encodeNormValue().  Use the byte-based method instead
  to ensure that the norm is encoded with your Similarity.
  (Robert Muir, Mike McCandless)

* LUCENE-2374: Added Attribute reflection API: It's now possible to inspect the
  contents of AttributeImpl and AttributeSource using a well-defined API.
  This is e.g. used by Solr's AnalysisRequestHandlers to display all attributes
  in a structured way.
  There are also some backwards incompatible changes in toString() output,
  as LUCENE-2302 introduced the CharSequence interface to CharTermAttribute
  leading to changed toString() return values. The new API allows to get a
  string representation in a well-defined way using a new method
  reflectAsString(). For backwards compatibility reasons, when toString()
  was implemented by implementation subclasses, the default implementation of
  AttributeImpl.reflectWith() uses toString()s output instead to report the
  Attribute's properties. Otherwise, reflectWith() uses Java's reflection
  (like toString() did before) to get the attribute properties.
  In addition, the mandatory equals() and hashCode() are no longer required
  for AttributeImpls, but can still be provided (if needed).
  (Uwe Schindler)

* LUCENE-2691: Deprecate IndexWriter.getReader in favor of
  IndexReader.open(IndexWriter) (Grant Ingersoll, Mike McCandless)

* LUCENE-2876: Deprecated Scorer.getSimilarity(). If your Scorer uses a Similarity,
  it should keep it itself. Fixed Scorers to pass their parent Weight, so that
  Scorer.visitSubScorers (LUCENE-2590) will work correctly.
  (Robert Muir, Doron Cohen)

* LUCENE-2900: When opening a near-real-time (NRT) reader
  (IndexReader.re/open(IndexWriter)) you can now specify whether
  deletes should be applied.  Applying deletes can be costly, and some
  expert use cases can handle seeing deleted documents returned.  The
  deletes remain buffered so that the next time you open an NRT reader
  and pass true, all deletes will be a applied.  (Mike McCandless)

* LUCENE-1253: LengthFilter (and Solr's KeepWordTokenFilter) now
  require up front specification of enablePositionIncrement. Together with
  StopFilter they have a common base class (FilteringTokenFilter) that handles
  the position increments automatically. Implementors only need to override an
  accept() method that filters tokens.  (Uwe Schindler, Robert Muir)

Bug fixes

* LUCENE-2249: ParallelMultiSearcher should shut down thread pool on
  close.  (Martin Traverso via Uwe Schindler)

* LUCENE-2273: FieldCacheImpl.getCacheEntries() used WeakHashMap
  incorrectly and lead to ConcurrentModificationException.
  (Uwe Schindler, Robert Muir)

* LUCENE-2328: Index files fsync tracking moved from
  IndexWriter/IndexReader to Directory, and it no longer leaks memory.
  (Earwin Burrfoot via Mike McCandless)

* LUCENE-2074: Reduce buffer size of lexer back to default on reset.
  (Ruben Laguna, Shai Erera via Uwe Schindler)

* LUCENE-2496: Don't throw NPE if IndexWriter is opened with CREATE on
  a prior (corrupt) index missing its segments_N file.  (Mike
  McCandless)

* LUCENE-2458: QueryParser no longer automatically forms phrase queries,
  assuming whitespace tokenization. Previously all CJK queries, for example,
  would be turned into phrase queries. The old behavior is preserved with
  the matchVersion parameter for previous versions. Additionally, you can
  explicitly enable the old behavior with setAutoGeneratePhraseQueries(true)
  (Robert Muir)

* LUCENE-2537: FSDirectory.copy() implementation was unsafe and could result in
  OOM if a large file was copied. (Shai Erera)

* LUCENE-2580: MultiPhraseQuery throws AIOOBE if number of positions
  exceeds number of terms at one position (Jayendra Patil via Mike McCandless)

* LUCENE-2617: Optional clauses of a BooleanQuery were not factored
  into coord if the scorer for that segment returned null.  This
  can cause the same document to score to differently depending on
  what segment it resides in. (yonik)

* LUCENE-2272: Fix explain in PayloadNearQuery and also fix scoring issue (Peter Keegan via Grant Ingersoll)

* LUCENE-2732: Fix charset problems in XML loading in
  HyphenationCompoundWordTokenFilter.  (Uwe Schindler)

* LUCENE-2802: NRT DirectoryReader returned incorrect values from
  getVersion, isOptimized, getCommitUserData, getIndexCommit and isCurrent due
  to a mutable reference to the IndexWriters SegmentInfos.
  (Simon Willnauer, Earwin Burrfoot)

* LUCENE-2852: Fixed corner case in RAMInputStream that would hit a
  false EOF after seeking to EOF then seeking back to same block you
  were just in and then calling readBytes (Robert Muir, Mike McCandless)

* LUCENE-2860: Fixed SegmentInfo.sizeInBytes to factor includeDocStores when it
  decides whether to return the cached computed size or not. (Shai Erera)

* LUCENE-2584: SegmentInfo.files() could hit ConcurrentModificationException if
  called by multiple threads. (Alexander Kanarsky via Shai Erera)

* LUCENE-2809: Fixed IndexWriter.numDocs to take into account
  applied but not yet flushed deletes.  (Mike McCandless)

* LUCENE-2879: MultiPhraseQuery previously calculated its phrase IDF by summing
  internally, it now calls Similarity.idfExplain(Collection, IndexSearcher).
  (Robert Muir)

* LUCENE-2693: RAM used by IndexWriter was slightly incorrectly computed.
  (Jason Rutherglen via Shai Erera)

* LUCENE-1846: DateTools now uses the US locale everywhere, so DateTools.round()
  is safe also in strange locales.  (Uwe Schindler)

* LUCENE-2891: IndexWriterConfig did not accept -1 in setReaderTermIndexDivisor,
  which can be used to prevent loading the terms index into memory. (Shai Erera)

* LUCENE-2937: Encoding a float into a byte (e.g. encoding field norms during
  indexing) had an underflow detection bug that caused floatToByte(f)==0 where
  f was greater than 0, but slightly less than byteToFloat(1).  This meant that
  certain very small field norms (index_boost * length_norm) could have
  been rounded down to 0 instead of being rounded up to the smallest
  positive number.  (yonik)

* LUCENE-2936: PhraseQuery score explanations were not correctly
  identifying matches vs non-matches.  (hossman)

* LUCENE-2975: A hotspot bug corrupts IndexInput#readVInt()/readVLong() if
  the underlying readByte() is inlined (which happens e.g. in MMapDirectory).
  The loop was unwinded which makes the hotspot bug disappear.
  (Uwe Schindler, Robert Muir, Mike McCandless)

New features

* LUCENE-2128: Parallelized fetching document frequencies during weight
  creation. (Israel Tsadok, Simon Willnauer via Uwe Schindler)

* LUCENE-2069: Added Unicode 4 support to CharArraySet. Due to the switch
  to Java 5, supplementary characters are now lowercased correctly if the
  set is created as case insensitive.
  CharArraySet now requires a Version argument to preserve
  backwards compatibility. If Version < 3.1 is passed to the constructor,
  CharArraySet yields the old behavior. (Simon Willnauer)

* LUCENE-2069: Added Unicode 4 support to LowerCaseFilter. Due to the switch
  to Java 5, supplementary characters are now lowercased correctly.
  LowerCaseFilter now requires a Version argument to preserve
  backwards compatibility. If Version < 3.1 is passed to the constructor,
  LowerCaseFilter yields the old behavior. (Simon Willnauer, Robert Muir)

* LUCENE-2034: Added ReusableAnalyzerBase, an abstract subclass of Analyzer
  that makes it easier to reuse TokenStreams correctly. This issue also added
  StopwordAnalyzerBase, which improves consistency of all Analyzers that use
  stopwords, and implement many analyzers in contrib with it.
  (Simon Willnauer via Robert Muir)

* LUCENE-2198, LUCENE-2901: Support protected words in stemming TokenFilters using a
  new KeywordAttribute.  (Simon Willnauer, Drew Farris via Uwe Schindler)

* LUCENE-2183, LUCENE-2240, LUCENE-2241: Added Unicode 4 support
  to CharTokenizer and its subclasses. CharTokenizer now has new
  int-API which is conditionally preferred to the old char-API depending
  on the provided Version. Version < 3.1 will use the char-API.
  (Simon Willnauer via Uwe Schindler)

* LUCENE-2247: Added a CharArrayMap<V> for performance improvements
  in some stemmers and synonym filters. (Uwe Schindler)

* LUCENE-2320: Added SetOnce which wraps an object and allows it to be set
  exactly once. (Shai Erera via Mike McCandless)

* LUCENE-2314: Added AttributeSource.copyTo(AttributeSource) that
  allows to use cloneAttributes() and this method as a replacement
  for captureState()/restoreState(), if the state itself
  needs to be inspected/modified.  (Uwe Schindler)

* LUCENE-2293: Expose control over max number of threads that
  IndexWriter will allow to run concurrently while indexing
  documents (previously this was hardwired to 5), using
  IndexWriterConfig.setMaxThreadStates.  (Mike McCandless)

* LUCENE-2297: Enable turning on reader pooling inside IndexWriter
  even when getReader (near-real-timer reader) is not in use, through
  IndexWriterConfig.enable/disableReaderPooling.  (Mike McCandless)

* LUCENE-2331: Add NoMergePolicy which never returns any merges to execute. In
  addition, add NoMergeScheduler which never executes any merges. These two are
  convenient classes in case you want to disable segment merges by IndexWriter
  without tweaking a particular MergePolicy parameters, such as mergeFactor.
  MergeScheduler's methods are now public. (Shai Erera via Mike McCandless)

* LUCENE-2339: Deprecate static method Directory.copy in favor of
  Directory.copyTo, and use nio's FileChannel.transferTo when copying
  files between FSDirectory instances.  (Earwin Burrfoot via Mike
  McCandless).

* LUCENE-2074: Make StandardTokenizer fit for Unicode 4.0, if the
  matchVersion parameter is Version.LUCENE_31. (Uwe Schindler)

* LUCENE-2385: Moved NoDeletionPolicy from benchmark to core. NoDeletionPolicy
  can be used to prevent commits from ever getting deleted from the index.
  (Shai Erera)

* LUCENE-1585: IndexWriter now accepts a PayloadProcessorProvider which can
  return a DirPayloadProcessor for a given Directory, which returns a
  PayloadProcessor for a given Term. The PayloadProcessor will be used to
  process the payloads of the segments as they are merged (e.g. if one wants to
  rewrite payloads of external indexes as they are added, or of local ones).
  (Shai Erera, Michael Busch, Mike McCandless)

* LUCENE-2440: Add support for custom ExecutorService in
  ParallelMultiSearcher (Edward Drapkin via Mike McCandless)

* LUCENE-2295: Added a LimitTokenCountAnalyzer / LimitTokenCountFilter
  to wrap any other Analyzer and provide the same functionality as
  MaxFieldLength provided on IndexWriter.  This patch also fixes a bug
  in the offset calculation in CharTokenizer. (Uwe Schindler, Shai Erera)

* LUCENE-2526: Don't throw NPE from MultiPhraseQuery.toString when
  it's empty.  (Ross Woolf via Mike McCandless)

* LUCENE-2559: Added SegmentReader.reopen methods (John Wang via Mike
  McCandless)

* LUCENE-2590: Added Scorer.visitSubScorers, and Scorer.freq.  Along
  with a custom Collector these experimental methods make it possible
  to gather the hit-count per sub-clause and per document while a
  search is running.  (Simon Willnauer, Mike McCandless)

* LUCENE-2636: Added MultiCollector which allows running the search with several
  Collectors. (Shai Erera)

* LUCENE-2754, LUCENE-2757: Added a wrapper around MultiTermQueries
  to add span support: SpanMultiTermQueryWrapper<Q extends MultiTermQuery>.
  Using this wrapper its easy to add fuzzy/wildcard to e.g. a SpanNearQuery.
  (Robert Muir, Uwe Schindler)

* LUCENE-2838: ConstantScoreQuery now directly supports wrapping a Query
  instance for stripping off scores. The use of a QueryWrapperFilter
  is no longer needed and discouraged for that use case. Directly wrapping
  Query improves performance, as out-of-order collection is now supported.
  (Uwe Schindler)

* LUCENE-2864: Add getMaxTermFrequency (maximum within-document TF) to
  FieldInvertState so that it can be used in Similarity.computeNorm.
  (Robert Muir)

* LUCENE-2720: Segments now record the code version which created them.
  (Shai Erera, Mike McCandless, Uwe Schindler)

* LUCENE-2474: Added expert ReaderFinishedListener API to
  IndexReader, to allow apps that maintain external per-segment caches
  to evict entries when a segment is finished.  (Shay Banon, Yonik
  Seeley, Mike McCandless)

* LUCENE-2911: The new StandardTokenizer, UAX29URLEmailTokenizer, and
  the ICUTokenizer in contrib now all tag types with a consistent set
  of token types (defined in StandardTokenizer). Tokens in the major
  CJK types are explicitly marked to allow for custom downstream handling:
  <IDEOGRAPHIC>, <HANGUL>, <KATAKANA>, and <HIRAGANA>.
  (Robert Muir, Steven Rowe)

* LUCENE-2913: Add missing getters to Numeric* classes. (Uwe Schindler)

* LUCENE-1810: Added FieldSelectorResult.LATENT to not cache lazy loaded fields
  (Tim Smith, Grant Ingersoll)

* LUCENE-2692: Added several new SpanQuery classes for positional checking
  (match is in a range, payload is a specific value) (Grant Ingersoll)  

Optimizations

* LUCENE-2494: Use CompletionService in ParallelMultiSearcher instead of
  simple polling for results. (Edward Drapkin, Simon Willnauer)

* LUCENE-2075: Terms dict cache is now shared across threads instead
  of being stored separately in thread local storage.  Also fixed
  terms dict so that the cache is used when seeking the thread local
  term enum, which will be important for MultiTermQuery impls that do
  lots of seeking (Mike McCandless, Uwe Schindler, Robert Muir, Yonik
  Seeley)

* LUCENE-2136: If the multi reader (DirectoryReader or MultiReader)
  only has a single sub-reader, delegate all enum requests to it.
  This avoid the overhead of using a PQ unnecessarily.  (Mike
  McCandless)

* LUCENE-2137: Switch to AtomicInteger for some ref counting (Earwin
  Burrfoot via Mike McCandless)

* LUCENE-2123, LUCENE-2261: Move FuzzyQuery rewrite to separate RewriteMode
  into MultiTermQuery. The number of fuzzy expansions can be specified with
  the maxExpansions parameter to FuzzyQuery.
  (Uwe Schindler, Robert Muir, Mike McCandless)

* LUCENE-2164: ConcurrentMergeScheduler has more control over merge
  threads.  First, it gives smaller merges higher thread priority than
  larges ones.  Second, a new set/getMaxMergeCount setting will pause
  the larger merges to allow smaller ones to finish.  The defaults for
  these settings are now dynamic, depending the number CPU cores as
  reported by Runtime.getRuntime().availableProcessors() (Mike
  McCandless)

* LUCENE-2169: Improved CharArraySet.copy(), if source set is
  also a CharArraySet.  (Simon Willnauer via Uwe Schindler)

* LUCENE-2084: Change IndexableBinaryStringTools to work on byte[] and char[]
  directly, instead of Byte/CharBuffers, and modify CollationKeyFilter to
  take advantage of this for faster performance.
  (Steven Rowe, Uwe Schindler, Robert Muir)

* LUCENE-2188: Add a utility class for tracking deprecated overridden
  methods in non-final subclasses.
  (Uwe Schindler, Robert Muir)

* LUCENE-2195: Speedup CharArraySet if set is empty.
  (Simon Willnauer via Robert Muir)

* LUCENE-2285: Code cleanup. (Shai Erera via Uwe Schindler)

* LUCENE-2303: Remove code duplication in Token class by subclassing
  TermAttributeImpl, move DEFAULT_TYPE constant to TypeInterface, improve
  null-handling for TypeAttribute.  (Uwe Schindler)

* LUCENE-2329: Switch TermsHash* from using a PostingList object per unique
  term to parallel arrays, indexed by termID. This reduces garbage collection
  overhead significantly, which results in great indexing performance wins
  when the available JVM heap space is low. This will become even more
  important when the DocumentsWriter RAM buffer is searchable in the future,
  because then it will make sense to make the RAM buffers as large as
  possible. (Mike McCandless, Michael Busch)

* LUCENE-2380: The terms field cache methods (getTerms,
  getTermsIndex), which replace the older String equivalents
  (getStrings, getStringIndex), consume quite a bit less RAM in most
  cases.  (Mike McCandless)

* LUCENE-2410: ~20% speedup on exact (slop=0) PhraseQuery matching.
  (Mike McCandless)

* LUCENE-2531: Fix issue when sorting by a String field that was
  causing too many fallbacks to compare-by-value (instead of by-ord).
  (Mike McCandless)

* LUCENE-2574: IndexInput exposes copyBytes(IndexOutput, long) to allow for
  efficient copying by sub-classes. Optimized copy is implemented for RAM and FS
  streams. (Shai Erera)

* LUCENE-2719: Improved TermsHashPerField's sorting to use a better
  quick sort algorithm that dereferences the pivot element not on
  every compare call. Also replaced lots of sorting code in Lucene
  by the improved SorterTemplate class.
  (Uwe Schindler, Robert Muir, Mike McCandless)

* LUCENE-2760: Optimize SpanFirstQuery and SpanPositionRangeQuery.
  (Robert Muir)

* LUCENE-2770: Make SegmentMerger always work on atomic subreaders,
  even when IndexWriter.addIndexes(IndexReader...) is used with
  DirectoryReaders or other MultiReaders. This saves lots of memory
  during merge of norms.  (Uwe Schindler, Mike McCandless)

* LUCENE-2824: Optimize BufferedIndexInput to do less bounds checks.
  (Robert Muir)

* LUCENE-2010: Segments with 100% deleted documents are now removed on
  IndexReader or IndexWriter commit.  (Uwe Schindler, Mike McCandless)

* LUCENE-1472: Removed synchronization from static DateTools methods
  by using a ThreadLocal. Also converted DateTools.Resolution to a
  Java 5 enum (this should not break backwards).  (Uwe Schindler)

Build

* LUCENE-2124: Moved the JDK-based collation support from contrib/collation
  into core, and moved the ICU-based collation support into contrib/icu.
  (Robert Muir)

* LUCENE-2326: Removed SVN checkouts for backwards tests. The backwards
  branch is now included in the svn repository using "svn copy"
  after release. (Uwe Schindler)

* LUCENE-2074: Regenerating StandardTokenizerImpl files now needs
  JFlex 1.5 (currently only available on SVN). (Uwe Schindler)

* LUCENE-1709: Tests are now parallelized by default (except for benchmark). You
  can force them to run sequentially by passing -Drunsequential=1 on the command
  line. The number of threads that are spawned per CPU defaults to '1'. If you
  wish to change that, you can run the tests with -DthreadsPerProcessor=[num].
  (Robert Muir, Shai Erera, Peter Kofler)

* LUCENE-2516: Backwards tests are now compiled against released lucene-core.jar
  from tarball of previous version. Backwards tests are now packaged together
  with src distribution.  (Uwe Schindler)

* LUCENE-2611: Added Ant target to install IntelliJ IDEA configuration:
  "ant idea".  See http://wiki.apache.org/lucene-java/HowtoConfigureIntelliJ
  (Steven Rowe)

* LUCENE-2657: Switch from using Maven POM templates to full POMs when
  generating Maven artifacts (Steven Rowe)

* LUCENE-2609: Added jar-test-framework Ant target which packages Lucene's
  tests' framework classes. (Drew Farris, Grant Ingersoll, Shai Erera,
  Steven Rowe)

Test Cases

* LUCENE-2037 Allow Junit4 tests in our environment (Erick Erickson
  via Mike McCandless)

* LUCENE-1844: Speed up the unit tests (Mark Miller, Erick Erickson,
  Mike McCandless)

* LUCENE-2065: Use Java 5 generics throughout our unit tests.  (Kay
  Kay via Mike McCandless)

* LUCENE-2155: Fix time and zone dependent localization test failures
  in queryparser tests. (Uwe Schindler, Chris Male, Robert Muir)

* LUCENE-2170: Fix thread starvation problems.  (Uwe Schindler)

* LUCENE-2248, LUCENE-2251, LUCENE-2285: Refactor tests to not use
  Version.LUCENE_CURRENT, but instead use a global static value
  from LuceneTestCase(J4), that contains the release version.
  (Uwe Schindler, Simon Willnauer, Shai Erera)

* LUCENE-2313, LUCENE-2322: Add VERBOSE to LuceneTestCase(J4) to control
  verbosity of tests. If VERBOSE==false (default) tests should not print
  anything other than errors to System.(out|err). The setting can be
  changed with -Dtests.verbose=true on test invocation.
  (Shai Erera, Paul Elschot, Uwe Schindler)

* LUCENE-2318: Remove inconsistent system property code for retrieving
  temp and data directories inside test cases. It is now centralized in
  LuceneTestCase(J4). Also changed lots of tests to use
  getClass().getResourceAsStream() to retrieve test data. Tests needing
  access to "real" files from the test folder itself, can use
  LuceneTestCase(J4).getDataFile().  (Uwe Schindler)

* LUCENE-2398, LUCENE-2611: Improve tests to work better from IDEs such
  as Eclipse and IntelliJ.
  (Paolo Castagna, Steven Rowe via Robert Muir)

* LUCENE-2804: add newFSDirectory to LuceneTestCase to create a FSDirectory at
  random. (Shai Erera, Robert Muir)

Documentation

* LUCENE-2579: Fix oal.search's package.html description of abstract
  methods.  (Santiago M. Mola via Mike McCandless)

* LUCENE-2625: Add a note to IndexReader.termDocs() with additional verbiage
  that the TermEnum must be seeked since it is unpositioned.
  (Adriano Crestani via Robert Muir)

* LUCENE-2894: Use google-code-prettify for syntax highlighting in javadoc.
  (Shinichiro Abe, Koji Sekiguchi)
  
================== Release 2.9.4 / 3.0.3 ====================

Changes in runtime behavior

* LUCENE-2689: NativeFSLockFactory no longer attempts to acquire a
  test lock just before the real lock is acquired.  (Surinder Pal
  Singh Bindra via Mike McCandless)

* LUCENE-2762: Fixed bug in IndexWriter causing it to hold open file
  handles against deleted files when compound-file was enabled (the
  default) and readers are pooled.  As a result of this the peak
  worst-case free disk space required during optimize is now 3X the
  index size, when compound file is enabled (else 2X).  (Mike
  McCandless)

* LUCENE-2773: LogMergePolicy accepts a double noCFSRatio (default =
  0.1), which means any time a merged segment is greater than 10% of
  the index size, it will be left in non-compound format even if
  compound format is on.  This change was made to reduce peak
  transient disk usage during optimize which increased due to
  LUCENE-2762.  (Mike McCandless)
  
Bug fixes

* LUCENE-2142 (correct fix): FieldCacheImpl.getStringIndex no longer
  throws an exception when term count exceeds doc count.
  (Mike McCandless, Uwe Schindler)

* LUCENE-2513: when opening writable IndexReader on a not-current
  commit, do not overwrite "future" commits.  (Mike McCandless)

* LUCENE-2536: IndexWriter.rollback was failing to properly rollback
  buffered deletions against segments that were flushed (Mark Harwood
  via Mike McCandless)

* LUCENE-2541: Fixed NumericRangeQuery that returned incorrect results
  with endpoints near Long.MIN_VALUE and Long.MAX_VALUE:
  NumericUtils.splitRange() overflowed, if
  - the range contained a LOWER bound
    that was greater than (Long.MAX_VALUE - (1L << precisionStep))
  - the range contained an UPPER bound
    that was less than (Long.MIN_VALUE + (1L << precisionStep))
  With standard precision steps around 4, this had no effect on
  most queries, only those that met the above conditions.
  Queries with large precision steps failed more easy. Queries with
  precision step >=64 were not affected. Also 32 bit data types int
  and float were not affected.
  (Yonik Seeley, Uwe Schindler)

* LUCENE-2593: Fixed certain rare cases where a disk full could lead
  to a corrupted index (Robert Muir, Mike McCandless)
  
* LUCENE-2620: Fixed a bug in WildcardQuery where too many asterisks
  would result in unbearably slow performance.  (Nick Barkas via Robert Muir)

* LUCENE-2627: Fixed bug in MMapDirectory chunking when a file is an
  exact multiple of the chunk size.  (Robert Muir)

* LUCENE-2634: isCurrent on an NRT reader was failing to return false
  if the writer had just committed (Nikolay Zamosenchuk via Mike McCandless)

* LUCENE-2650: Added extra safety to MMapIndexInput clones to prevent accessing
  an unmapped buffer if the input is closed (Mike McCandless, Uwe Schindler, Robert Muir)
  
* LUCENE-2384: Reset zzBuffer in StandardTokenizerImpl when lexer is reset.
  (Ruben Laguna via Uwe Schindler, sub-issue of LUCENE-2074) 
  
* LUCENE-2658: Exceptions while processing term vectors enabled for multiple
  fields could lead to invalid ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsExceptions.
  (Robert Muir, Mike McCandless)

* LUCENE-2235: Implement missing PerFieldAnalyzerWrapper.getOffsetGap().
  (Javier Godoy via Uwe Schindler)

* LUCENE-2328: Fixed memory leak in how IndexWriter/Reader tracked
  already sync'd files. (Earwin Burrfoot via Mike McCandless)

* LUCENE-2549: Fix TimeLimitingCollector#TimeExceededException to record
  the absolute docid.  (Uwe Schindler)
 
* LUCENE-2533: fix FileSwitchDirectory.listAll to not return dups when
  primary & secondary dirs share the same underlying directory.
  (Michael McCandless)

* LUCENE-2365: IndexWriter.newestSegment (used normally for testing)
  is fixed to return null if there are no segments.  (Karthick
  Sankarachary via Mike McCandless)

* LUCENE-2730: Fix two rare deadlock cases in IndexWriter (Mike McCandless)

* LUCENE-2744: CheckIndex was stating total number of fields,
  not the number that have norms enabled, on the "test: field
  norms..." output.  (Mark Kristensson via Mike McCandless)

* LUCENE-2759: Fixed two near-real-time cases where doc store files
  may be opened for read even though they are still open for write.
  (Mike McCandless)

* LUCENE-2618: Fix rare thread safety issue whereby
  IndexWriter.optimize could sometimes return even though the index
  wasn't fully optimized (Mike McCandless)

* LUCENE-2767: Fix thread safety issue in addIndexes(IndexReader[])
  that could potentially result in index corruption.  (Mike
  McCandless)

* LUCENE-2762: Fixed bug in IndexWriter causing it to hold open file
  handles against deleted files when compound-file was enabled (the
  default) and readers are pooled.  As a result of this the peak
  worst-case free disk space required during optimize is now 3X the
  index size, when compound file is enabled (else 2X).  (Mike
  McCandless)

* LUCENE-2216: OpenBitSet.hashCode returned different hash codes for
  sets that only differed by trailing zeros. (Dawid Weiss, yonik)

* LUCENE-2782: Fix rare potential thread hazard with
  IndexWriter.commit (Mike McCandless)

API Changes

* LUCENE-2773: LogMergePolicy accepts a double noCFSRatio (default =
  0.1), which means any time a merged segment is greater than 10% of
  the index size, it will be left in non-compound format even if
  compound format is on.  This change was made to reduce peak
  transient disk usage during optimize which increased due to
  LUCENE-2762.  (Mike McCandless)

Optimizations

* LUCENE-2556: Improve memory usage after cloning TermAttribute.
  (Adriano Crestani via Uwe Schindler)

* LUCENE-2098: Improve the performance of BaseCharFilter, especially for
  large documents.  (Robin Wojciki, Koji Sekiguchi, Robert Muir)

New features

* LUCENE-2675 (2.9.4 only): Add support for Lucene 3.0 stored field files
  also in 2.9. The file format did not change, only the version number was
  upgraded to mark segments that have no compression. FieldsWriter still only
  writes 2.9 segments as they could contain compressed fields. This cross-version
  index format compatibility is provided here solely because Lucene 2.9 and 3.0
  have the same bugfix level, features, and the same index format with this slight
  compression difference. In general, Lucene does not support reading newer
  indexes with older library versions. (Uwe Schindler)
  
Documentation

* LUCENE-2239: Documented limitations in NIOFSDirectory and MMapDirectory due to
  Java NIO behavior when a Thread is interrupted while blocking on IO.
  (Simon Willnauer, Robert Muir)

================== Release 2.9.3 / 3.0.2 ====================

Changes in backwards compatibility policy

* LUCENE-2135: Added FieldCache.purge(IndexReader) method to the
  interface.  Anyone implementing FieldCache externally will need to
  fix their code to implement this, on upgrading.  (Mike McCandless)

Changes in runtime behavior

* LUCENE-2421: NativeFSLockFactory does not throw LockReleaseFailedException if 
  it cannot delete the lock file, since obtaining the lock does not fail if the 
  file is there. (Shai Erera)

* LUCENE-2060 (2.9.3 only): Changed ConcurrentMergeScheduler's default for
  maxNumThreads from 3 to 1, because in practice we get the most gains
  from running a single merge in the backround.  More than one
  concurrent merge causes alot of thrashing (though it's possible on
  SSD storage that there would be net gains).  (Jason Rutherglen, Mike
  McCandless)

Bug fixes

* LUCENE-2046 (2.9.3 only): IndexReader should not see the index as changed, after
  IndexWriter.prepareCommit has been called but before
  IndexWriter.commit is called. (Peter Keegan via Mike McCandless)

* LUCENE-2119: Don't throw NegativeArraySizeException if you pass
  Integer.MAX_VALUE as nDocs to IndexSearcher search methods.  (Paul
  Taylor via Mike McCandless)

* LUCENE-2142: FieldCacheImpl.getStringIndex no longer throws an
  exception when term count exceeds doc count.  (Mike McCandless)

* LUCENE-2104: NativeFSLock.release() would silently fail if the lock is held by 
  another thread/process.  (Shai Erera via Uwe Schindler)
  
* LUCENE-2283: Use shared memory pool for term vector and stored
  fields buffers. This memory will be reclaimed if needed according to
  the configured RAM Buffer Size for the IndexWriter.  This also fixes
  potentially excessive memory usage when many threads are indexing a
  mix of small and large documents.  (Tim Smith via Mike McCandless)

* LUCENE-2300: If IndexWriter is pooling reader (because NRT reader
  has been obtained), and addIndexes* is run, do not pool the
  readers from the external directory.  This is harmless (NRT reader is
  correct), but a waste of resources.  (Mike McCandless)

* LUCENE-2422: Don't reuse byte[] in IndexInput/Output -- it gains
  little performance, and ties up possibly large amounts of memory
  for apps that index large docs.  (Ross Woolf via Mike McCandless)

* LUCENE-2387: Don't hang onto Fieldables from the last doc indexed,
  in IndexWriter, nor the Reader in Tokenizer after close is
  called.  (Ruben Laguna, Uwe Schindler, Mike McCandless)

* LUCENE-2417: IndexCommit did not implement hashCode() and equals() 
  consistently. Now they both take Directory and version into consideration. In
  addition, all of IndexComnmit methods which threw 
  UnsupportedOperationException are now abstract. (Shai Erera)

* LUCENE-2467: Fixed memory leaks in IndexWriter when large documents
  are indexed.  (Mike McCandless)

* LUCENE-2473: Clicking on the "More Results" link in the luceneweb.war
  demo resulted in ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException.
  (Sami Siren via Robert Muir)

* LUCENE-2476: If any exception is hit init'ing IW, release the write
  lock (previously we only released on IOException).  (Tamas Cservenak
  via Mike McCandless)

* LUCENE-2478: Fix CachingWrapperFilter to not throw NPE when
  Filter.getDocIdSet() returns null.  (Uwe Schindler, Daniel Noll)

* LUCENE-2468: Allow specifying how new deletions should be handled in
  CachingWrapperFilter and CachingSpanFilter.  By default, new
  deletions are ignored in CachingWrapperFilter, since typically this
  filter is AND'd with a query that correctly takes new deletions into
  account.  This should be a performance gain (higher cache hit rate)
  in apps that reopen readers, or use near-real-time reader
  (IndexWriter.getReader()), but may introduce invalid search results
  (allowing deleted docs to be returned) for certain cases, so a new
  expert ctor was added to CachingWrapperFilter to enforce deletions
  at a performance cost.  CachingSpanFilter by default recaches if
  there are new deletions (Shay Banon via Mike McCandless)

* LUCENE-2299: If you open an NRT reader while addIndexes* is running,
  it may miss some segments (Earwin Burrfoot via Mike McCandless)

* LUCENE-2397: Don't throw NPE from SnapshotDeletionPolicy.snapshot if
  there are no commits yet (Shai Erera)

* LUCENE-2424: Fix FieldDoc.toString to actually return its fields
  (Stephen Green via Mike McCandless)

* LUCENE-2311: Always pass a "fully loaded" (terms index & doc stores)
  SegmentsReader to IndexWriter's mergedSegmentWarmer (if set), so
  that warming is free to do whatever it needs to.  (Earwin Burrfoot
  via Mike McCandless)

* LUCENE-3029: Fix corner case when MultiPhraseQuery is used with zero
  position-increment tokens that would sometimes assign different
  scores to identical docs.  (Mike McCandless)

* LUCENE-2486: Fixed intermittent FileNotFoundException on doc store
  files when a mergedSegmentWarmer is set on IndexWriter.  (Mike
  McCandless)

* LUCENE-2130: Fix performance issue when FuzzyQuery runs on a
  multi-segment index (Michael McCandless)

API Changes

* LUCENE-2281: added doBeforeFlush to IndexWriter to allow extensions to perform
  operations before flush starts. Also exposed doAfterFlush as protected instead
  of package-private. (Shai Erera via Mike McCandless)

* LUCENE-2356: Add IndexWriter.set/getReaderTermsIndexDivisor, to set
  what IndexWriter passes for termsIndexDivisor to the readers it
  opens internally when applying deletions or creating a
  near-real-time reader.  (Earwin Burrfoot via Mike McCandless)

Optimizations

* LUCENE-2494 (3.0.2 only): Use CompletionService in ParallelMultiSearcher
  instead of simple polling for results. (Edward Drapkin, Simon Willnauer) 

* LUCENE-2135: On IndexReader.close, forcefully evict any entries from
  the FieldCache rather than waiting for the WeakHashMap to release
  the reference (Mike McCandless)

* LUCENE-2161: Improve concurrency of IndexReader, especially in the
  context of near real-time readers.  (Mike McCandless)

* LUCENE-2360: Small speedup to recycling of reused per-doc RAM in
  IndexWriter (Robert Muir, Mike McCandless)

Build

* LUCENE-2488 (2.9.3 only): Support build with JDK 1.4 and exclude Java 1.5
  contrib modules on request (pass '-Dforce.jdk14.build=true') when
  compiling/testing/packaging. This marks the benchmark contrib also
  as Java 1.5, as it depends on fast-vector-highlighter. (Uwe Schindler)

================== Release 2.9.2 / 3.0.1 ====================

Changes in backwards compatibility policy

* LUCENE-2123 (3.0.1 only): Removed the protected inner class ScoreTerm
  from FuzzyQuery. The change was needed because the comparator of this
  class had to be changed in an incompatible way. The class was never
  intended to be public.  (Uwe Schindler, Mike McCandless)
  
Bug fixes

 * LUCENE-2092: BooleanQuery was ignoring disableCoord in its hashCode
   and equals methods, cause bad things to happen when caching
   BooleanQueries.  (Chris Hostetter, Mike McCandless)

 * LUCENE-2095: Fixes: when two threads call IndexWriter.commit() at
   the same time, it's possible for commit to return control back to
   one of the threads before all changes are actually committed.
   (Sanne Grinovero via Mike McCandless)

 * LUCENE-2132 (3.0.1 only): Fix the demo result.jsp to use QueryParser
   with a Version argument.  (Brian Li via Robert Muir)

 * LUCENE-2166: Don't incorrectly keep warning about the same immense
   term, when IndexWriter.infoStream is on.  (Mike McCandless)

 * LUCENE-2158: At high indexing rates, NRT reader could temporarily
   lose deletions.  (Mike McCandless)
  
 * LUCENE-2182: DEFAULT_ATTRIBUTE_FACTORY was failing to load
   implementation class when interface was loaded by a different
   class loader.  (Uwe Schindler, reported on java-user by Ahmed El-dawy)

 * LUCENE-2257: Increase max number of unique terms in one segment to
   termIndexInterval (default 128) * ~2.1 billion = ~274 billion.
   (Tom Burton-West via Mike McCandless)
  
 * LUCENE-2260: Fixed AttributeSource to not hold a strong
   reference to the Attribute/AttributeImpl classes which prevents
   unloading of custom attributes loaded by other classloaders
   (e.g. in Solr plugins).  (Uwe Schindler)
 
 * LUCENE-1941: Fix Min/MaxPayloadFunction returns 0 when
   only one payload is present.  (Erik Hatcher, Mike McCandless
   via Uwe Schindler)

 * LUCENE-2270: Queries consisting of all zero-boost clauses
   (for example, text:foo^0) sorted incorrectly and produced
   invalid docids. (yonik)

API Changes

 * LUCENE-1609 (3.0.1 only): Restore IndexReader.getTermInfosIndexDivisor
   (it was accidentally removed in 3.0.0)  (Mike McCandless)

 * LUCENE-1972 (3.0.1 only): Restore SortField.getComparatorSource
   (it was accidentally removed in 3.0.0)  (John Wang via Uwe Schindler)

 * LUCENE-2190: Added a new class CustomScoreProvider to function package
   that can be subclassed to provide custom scoring to CustomScoreQuery.
   The methods in CustomScoreQuery that did this before were deprecated
   and replaced by a method getCustomScoreProvider(IndexReader) that
   returns a custom score implementation using the above class. The change
   is necessary with per-segment searching, as CustomScoreQuery is
   a stateless class (like all other Queries) and does not know about
   the currently searched segment. This API works similar to Filter's
   getDocIdSet(IndexReader).  (Paul chez Jamespot via Mike McCandless,
   Uwe Schindler)

 * LUCENE-2080: Deprecate Version.LUCENE_CURRENT, as using this constant
   will cause backwards compatibility problems when upgrading Lucene. See
   the Version javadocs for additional information.
   (Robert Muir)

Optimizations

 * LUCENE-2086: When resolving deleted terms, do so in term sort order
   for better performance (Bogdan Ghidireac via Mike McCandless)

======================= Release 3.0.0 =======================

Changes in backwards compatibility policy

* LUCENE-1979: Change return type of SnapshotDeletionPolicy#snapshot()
  from IndexCommitPoint to IndexCommit. Code that uses this method
  needs to be recompiled against Lucene 3.0 in order to work. The
  previously deprecated IndexCommitPoint is also removed.
  (Michael Busch)

* o.a.l.Lock.isLocked() is now allowed to throw an IOException.
  (Mike McCandless)

* LUCENE-2030: CachingWrapperFilter and CachingSpanFilter now hide
  the internal cache implementation for thread safety, before it was
  declared protected.  (Peter Lenahan, Uwe Schindler, Simon Willnauer)

* LUCENE-2053: If you call Thread.interrupt() on a thread inside
  Lucene, Lucene will do its best to interrupt the thread.  However,
  instead of throwing InterruptedException (which is a checked
  exception), you'll get an oal.util.ThreadInterruptedException (an
  unchecked exception, subclassing RuntimeException).  The interrupt
  status on the thread is cleared when this exception is thrown.
  (Mike McCandless)

* LUCENE-2052: Some methods in Lucene core were changed to accept
  Java 5 varargs. This is not a backwards compatibility problem as
  long as you not try to override such a method. We left common
  overridden methods unchanged and added varargs to constructors,
  static, or final methods (MultiSearcher,...).  (Uwe Schindler)

* LUCENE-1558: IndexReader.open(Directory) now opens a readOnly=true
  reader, and new IndexSearcher(Directory) does the same.  Note that
  this is a change in the default from 2.9, when these methods were
  previously deprecated.  (Mike McCandless)

* LUCENE-1753: Make not yet final TokenStreams final to enforce 
  decorator pattern. (Uwe Schindler)

Changes in runtime behavior

* LUCENE-1677: Remove the system property to set SegmentReader class
  implementation.  (Uwe Schindler)

* LUCENE-1960: As a consequence of the removal of Field.Store.COMPRESS,
  support for this type of fields was removed. Lucene 3.0 is still able
  to read indexes with compressed fields, but as soon as merges occur
  or the index is optimized, all compressed fields are decompressed
  and converted to Field.Store.YES. Because of this, indexes with
  compressed fields can suddenly get larger. Also the first merge with
  decompression cannot be done in raw mode, it is therefore slower.
  This change has no effect for code that uses such old indexes,
  they behave as before (fields are automatically decompressed
  during read). Indexes converted to Lucene 3.0 format cannot be read
  anymore with previous versions.
  It is recommended to optimize your indexes after upgrading to convert
  to the new format and decompress all fields.
  If you want compressed fields, you can use CompressionTools, that
  creates compressed byte[] to be added as binary stored field. This
  cannot be done automatically, as you also have to decompress such
  fields when reading. You have to reindex to do that.
  (Michael Busch, Uwe Schindler)

* LUCENE-2060: Changed ConcurrentMergeScheduler's default for
  maxNumThreads from 3 to 1, because in practice we get the most
  gains from running a single merge in the background.  More than one
  concurrent merge causes a lot of thrashing (though it's possible on
  SSD storage that there would be net gains).  (Jason Rutherglen,
  Mike McCandless)

API Changes

* LUCENE-1257, LUCENE-1984, LUCENE-1985, LUCENE-2057, LUCENE-1833, LUCENE-2012,

  DM Smith)

* Generify Lucene API:

  - TokenStream/AttributeSource: Now addAttribute()/getAttribute() return an
    instance of the requested attribute interface and no cast needed anymore

  protected; add expert ctor to directly specify reader, subReaders
  and docStarts.  (John Wang, Tim Smith via Mike McCandless)

* LUCENE-1945: All public classes that have a close() method now
  also implement java.io.Closeable (IndexReader, IndexWriter, Directory,...).
  (Uwe Schindler)

* LUCENE-1998: Change all Parameter instances to Java 5 enums. This
  is no backwards-break, only a change of the super class. Parameter
  was deprecated and will be removed in a later version.
  (DM Smith, Uwe Schindler)
   
Bug fixes

* LUCENE-1951: When the text provided to WildcardQuery has no wildcard
  characters (ie matches a single term), don't lose the boost and
  rewrite method settings.  Also, rewrite to PrefixQuery if the
  wildcard is form "foo*", for slightly faster performance. (Robert
  Muir via Mike McCandless)

* LUCENE-2013: SpanRegexQuery does not work with QueryScorer.
  (Benjamin Keil via Mark Miller)

  extend Attribute. (Shai Erera, Uwe Schindler)

* LUCENE-2045: Fix silly FileNotFoundException hit if you enable
  infoStream on IndexWriter and then add an empty document and commit
  (Shai Erera via Mike McCandless)

* LUCENE-2046: IndexReader should not see the index as changed, after
  IndexWriter.prepareCommit has been called but before
  IndexWriter.commit is called. (Peter Keegan via Mike McCandless)

New features

* LUCENE-1933: Provide a convenience AttributeFactory that creates a
  Token instance for all basic attributes.  (Uwe Schindler)

* LUCENE-2041: Parallelize the rest of ParallelMultiSearcher. Lots of
  code refactoring and Java 5 concurrent support in MultiSearcher.
  (Joey Surls, Simon Willnauer via Uwe Schindler)

 * LUCENE-1124: Make sure FuzzyQuery always matches the precise term.
   (stefatwork@gmail.com via Mike McCandless)

 * LUCENE-1976: Fix IndexReader.isCurrent() to return the right thing

   does.  (Aaron McKee, Yonik Seeley, Mike McCandless)

 * LUCENE-2004: Fix Constants.LUCENE_MAIN_VERSION to not be inlined
   by client code.  (Uwe Schindler)

 * LUCENE-2016: Replace illegal U+FFFF character with the replacement
   char (U+FFFD) during indexing, to prevent silent index corruption.
   (Peter Keegan, Mike McCandless)

   Searchable interface (deprecated by accident).  (Uwe Schindler)

 * Un-deprecate o.a.l.util.Version constants.  (Mike McCandless)

 * LUCENE-1987: Un-deprecate some ctors of Token, as they will not
   be removed in 3.0 and are still useful. Also add some missing
   o.a.l.util.Version constants for enabling invalid acronym
   settings in StandardAnalyzer to be compatible with the coming
   Lucene 3.0.  (Uwe Schindler)

 * LUCENE-1973: Un-deprecate IndexSearcher.setDefaultFieldSortScoring,
   to allow controlling per-IndexSearcher whether scores are computed
   when sorting by field.  (Uwe Schindler, Mike McCandless)

 * LUCENE-2043: Make IndexReader.commit(Map<String,String>) public.
   (Mike McCandless)
   
Documentation

 * LUCENE-1955: Fix Hits deprecation notice to point users in right
   direction. (Mike McCandless, Mark Miller)
   
 * Fix javadoc about score tracking done by search methods in Searcher 
   and IndexSearcher.  (Mike McCandless)

 * LUCENE-2008: Javadoc improvements for TokenStream/Tokenizer/Token
   (Luke Nezda via Mike McCandless)

======================= Release 2.9.0 =======================

Changes in backwards compatibility policy

 * LUCENE-1575: Searchable.search(Weight, Filter, int, Sort) no
    longer computes a document score for each hit by default.  If
    document score tracking is still needed, you can call
    IndexSearcher.setDefaultFieldSortScoring(true, true) to enable
    both per-hit and maxScore tracking; however, this is deprecated
    and will be removed in 3.0.

    Alternatively, use Searchable.search(Weight, Filter, Collector)
    and pass in a TopFieldCollector instance, using the following code
    sample:
 
    <code>
      TopFieldCollector tfc = TopFieldCollector.create(sort, numHits, fillFields, 
                                                       true /* trackDocScores */,
                                                       true /* trackMaxScore */,
                                                       false /* docsInOrder */);
      searcher.search(query, tfc);
      TopDocs results = tfc.topDocs();
    </code>

    Note that your Sort object cannot use SortField.AUTO when you
    directly instantiate TopFieldCollector.

    Also, the method search(Weight, Filter, Collector) was added to
    the Searchable interface and the Searcher abstract class to
    replace the deprecated HitCollector versions.  If you either
    implement Searchable or extend Searcher, you should change your
    code to implement this method.  If you already extend
    IndexSearcher, no further changes are needed to use Collector.
    
    Finally, the values Float.NaN and Float.NEGATIVE_INFINITY are not
    valid scores.  Lucene uses these values internally in certain
    places, so if you have hits with such scores, it will cause
    problems. (Shai Erera via Mike McCandless)

 * LUCENE-1687: All methods and parsers from the interface ExtendedFieldCache
    have been moved into FieldCache. ExtendedFieldCache is now deprecated and
    contains only a few declarations for binary backwards compatibility. 
    ExtendedFieldCache will be removed in version 3.0. Users of FieldCache and 
    ExtendedFieldCache will be able to plug in Lucene 2.9 without recompilation.
    The auto cache (FieldCache.getAuto) is now deprecated. Due to the merge of
    ExtendedFieldCache and FieldCache, FieldCache can now additionally return
    long[] and double[] arrays in addition to int[] and float[] and StringIndex.
    
    The interface changes are only notable for users implementing the interfaces,
    which was unlikely done, because there is no possibility to change
    Lucene's FieldCache implementation.  (Grant Ingersoll, Uwe Schindler)
    
 * LUCENE-1630, LUCENE-1771: Weight, previously an interface, is now an abstract 
    class. Some of the method signatures have changed, but it should be fairly
    easy to see what adjustments must be made to existing code to sync up
    with the new API. You can find more detail in the API Changes section.
    
    Going forward Searchable will be kept for convenience only and may
    be changed between minor releases without any deprecation
    process. It is not recommended that you implement it, but rather extend
    Searcher.  
    (Shai Erera, Chris Hostetter, Martin Ruckli, Mark Miller via Mike McCandless)

 * LUCENE-1422, LUCENE-1693: The new Attribute based TokenStream API (see below)
    has some backwards breaks in rare cases. We did our best to make the 
    transition as easy as possible and you are not likely to run into any problems. 
    If your tokenizers still implement next(Token) or next(), the calls are 
    automatically wrapped. The indexer and query parser use the new API 
    (eg use incrementToken() calls). All core TokenStreams are implemented using 
    the new API. You can mix old and new API style TokenFilters/TokenStream. 
    Problems only occur when you have done the following:
    You have overridden next(Token) or next() in one of the non-abstract core
    TokenStreams/-Filters. These classes should normally be final, but some
    of them are not. In this case, next(Token)/next() would never be called.
    To fail early with a hard compile/runtime error, the next(Token)/next()
    methods in these TokenStreams/-Filters were made final in this release.
    (Michael Busch, Uwe Schindler)

 * LUCENE-1763: MergePolicy now requires an IndexWriter instance to
    be passed upon instantiation. As a result, IndexWriter was removed
    as a method argument from all MergePolicy methods. (Shai Erera via
    Mike McCandless)
    
 * LUCENE-1748: LUCENE-1001 introduced PayloadSpans, but this was a back
    compat break and caused custom SpanQuery implementations to fail at runtime
    in a variety of ways. This issue attempts to remedy things by causing
    a compile time break on custom SpanQuery implementations and removing 
    the PayloadSpans class, with its functionality now moved to Spans. To
    help in alleviating future back compat pain, Spans has been changed from
    an interface to an abstract class.
    (Hugh Cayless, Mark Miller)
    
 * LUCENE-1808: Query.createWeight has been changed from protected to
    public. This will be a back compat break if you have overridden this
    method - but you are likely already affected by the LUCENE-1693 (make Weight 
    abstract rather than an interface) back compat break if you have overridden 
    Query.creatWeight, so we have taken the opportunity to make this change.
    (Tim Smith, Shai Erera via Mark Miller)

 * LUCENE-1708 - IndexReader.document() no longer checks if the document is
    deleted. You can call IndexReader.isDeleted(n) prior to calling document(n).
    (Shai Erera via Mike McCandless)
    
 
Changes in runtime behavior

 * LUCENE-1424: QueryParser now by default uses constant score auto
    rewriting when it generates a WildcardQuery and PrefixQuery (it
    already does so for TermRangeQuery, as well).  Call
    setMultiTermRewriteMethod(MultiTermQuery.SCORING_BOOLEAN_QUERY_REWRITE)
    to revert to slower BooleanQuery rewriting method.  (Mark Miller via Mike
    McCandless)
    
 * LUCENE-1575: As of 2.9, the core collectors as well as
    IndexSearcher's search methods that return top N results, no
    longer filter documents with scores <= 0.0. If you rely on this
    functionality you can use PositiveScoresOnlyCollector like this:

    <code>
      TopDocsCollector tdc = new TopScoreDocCollector(10);
      Collector c = new PositiveScoresOnlyCollector(tdc);
      searcher.search(query, c);
      TopDocs hits = tdc.topDocs();
      ...
    </code>

 * LUCENE-1604: IndexReader.norms(String field) is now allowed to
    return null if the field has no norms, as long as you've
    previously called IndexReader.setDisableFakeNorms(true).  This
    setting now defaults to false (to preserve the fake norms back
    compatible behavior) but in 3.0 will be hardwired to true.  (Shon
    Vella via Mike McCandless).

 * LUCENE-1624: If you open IndexWriter with create=true and
    autoCommit=false on an existing index, IndexWriter no longer
    writes an empty commit when it's created.  (Paul Taylor via Mike
    McCandless)

 * LUCENE-1593: When you call Sort() or Sort.setSort(String field,
    boolean reverse), the resulting SortField array no longer ends
    with SortField.FIELD_DOC (it was unnecessary as Lucene breaks ties
    internally by docID). (Shai Erera via Michael McCandless)

 * LUCENE-1542: When the first token(s) have 0 position increment,
    IndexWriter used to incorrectly record the position as -1, if no
    payload is present, or Integer.MAX_VALUE if a payload is present.
    This causes positional queries to fail to match.  The bug is now
    fixed, but if your app relies on the buggy behavior then you must
    call IndexWriter.setAllowMinus1Position().  That API is deprecated
    so you must fix your application, and rebuild your index, to not
    rely on this behavior by the 3.0 release of Lucene. (Jonathan
    Mamou, Mark Miller via Mike McCandless)


 * LUCENE-1715: Finalizers have been removed from the 4 core classes
    that still had them, since they will cause GC to take longer, thus
    tying up memory for longer, and at best they mask buggy app code.
    DirectoryReader (returned from IndexReader.open) & IndexWriter
    previously released the write lock during finalize.
    SimpleFSDirectory.FSIndexInput closed the descriptor in its
    finalizer, and NativeFSLock released the lock.  It's possible
    applications will be affected by this, but only if the application
    is failing to close reader/writers.  (Brian Groose via Mike
    McCandless)

 * LUCENE-1717: Fixed IndexWriter to account for RAM usage of
    buffered deletions.  (Mike McCandless)

 * LUCENE-1727: Ensure that fields are stored & retrieved in the
    exact order in which they were added to the document.  This was
    true in all Lucene releases before 2.3, but was broken in 2.3 and
    2.4, and is now fixed in 2.9.  (Mike McCandless)

 * LUCENE-1678: The addition of Analyzer.reusableTokenStream
    accidentally broke back compatibility of external analyzers that
    subclassed core analyzers that implemented tokenStream but not
    reusableTokenStream.  This is now fixed, such that if
    reusableTokenStream is invoked on such a subclass, that method
    will forcefully fallback to tokenStream.  (Mike McCandless)
    
 * LUCENE-1801: Token.clear() and Token.clearNoTermBuffer() now also clear
    startOffset, endOffset and type. This is not likely to affect any
    Tokenizer chains, as Tokenizers normally always set these three values.
    This change was made to be conform to the new AttributeImpl.clear() and
    AttributeSource.clearAttributes() to work identical for Token as one for all
    AttributeImpl and the 6 separate AttributeImpls. (Uwe Schindler, Michael Busch)

 * LUCENE-1483: When searching over multiple segments, a new Scorer is now created 
    for each segment. Searching has been telescoped out a level and IndexSearcher now
    operates much like MultiSearcher does. The Weight is created only once for the top 
    level Searcher, but each Scorer is passed a per-segment IndexReader. This will 
    result in doc ids in the Scorer being internal to the per-segment IndexReader. It 
    has always been outside of the API to count on a given IndexReader to contain every 
    doc id in the index - and if you have been ignoring MultiSearcher in your custom code 
    and counting on this fact, you will find your code no longer works correctly. If a 
    custom Scorer implementation uses any caches/filters that rely on being based on the 
    top level IndexReader, it will need to be updated to correctly use contextless 
    caches/filters eg you can't count on the IndexReader to contain any given doc id or 
    all of the doc ids. (Mark Miller, Mike McCandless)

 * LUCENE-1846: DateTools now uses the US locale to format the numbers in its
    date/time strings instead of the default locale. For most locales there will
    be no change in the index format, as DateFormatSymbols is using ASCII digits.
    The usage of the US locale is important to guarantee correct ordering of
    generated terms.  (Uwe Schindler)

 * LUCENE-1860: MultiTermQuery now defaults to
    CONSTANT_SCORE_AUTO_REWRITE_DEFAULT rewrite method (previously it
    was SCORING_BOOLEAN_QUERY_REWRITE).  This means that PrefixQuery
    and WildcardQuery will now produce constant score for all matching
    docs, equal to the boost of the query.  (Mike McCandless)

API Changes

 * LUCENE-1419: Add expert API to set custom indexing chain. This API is 
   package-protected for now, so we don't have to officially support it.
   Yet, it will give us the possibility to try out different consumers
   in the chain. (Michael Busch)

 * LUCENE-1427: DocIdSet.iterator() is now allowed to throw
   IOException.  (Paul Elschot, Mike McCandless)

 * LUCENE-1422, LUCENE-1693: New TokenStream API that uses a new class called 
   AttributeSource instead of the Token class, which is now a utility class that
   holds common Token attributes. All attributes that the Token class had have 
   been moved into separate classes: TermAttribute, OffsetAttribute, 
   PositionIncrementAttribute, PayloadAttribute, TypeAttribute and FlagsAttribute. 
   The new API is much more flexible; it allows to combine the Attributes 
   arbitrarily and also to define custom Attributes. The new API has the same 
   performance as the old next(Token) approach. For conformance with this new 
   API Tee-/SinkTokenizer was deprecated and replaced by a new TeeSinkTokenFilter. 
   (Michael Busch, Uwe Schindler; additional contributions and bug fixes by 
   Daniel Shane, Doron Cohen)

 * LUCENE-1467: Add nextDoc() and next(int) methods to OpenBitSetIterator.
   These methods can be used to avoid additional calls to doc(). 
   (Michael Busch)

 * LUCENE-1468: Deprecate Directory.list(), which sometimes (in
   FSDirectory) filters out files that don't look like index files, in
   favor of new Directory.listAll(), which does no filtering.  Also,
   listAll() will never return null; instead, it throws an IOException
   (or subclass).  Specifically, FSDirectory.listAll() will throw the
   newly added NoSuchDirectoryException if the directory does not
   exist.  (Marcel Reutegger, Mike McCandless)

 * LUCENE-1546: Add IndexReader.flush(Map commitUserData), allowing
   you to record an opaque commitUserData (maps String -> String) into
   the commit written by IndexReader.  This matches IndexWriter's
   commit methods.  (Jason Rutherglen via Mike McCandless)

 * LUCENE-652: Added org.apache.lucene.document.CompressionTools, to
   enable compressing & decompressing binary content, external to
   Lucene's indexing.  Deprecated Field.Store.COMPRESS.

 * LUCENE-1561: Renamed Field.omitTf to Field.omitTermFreqAndPositions
    (Otis Gospodnetic via Mike McCandless)
  
 * LUCENE-1500: Added new InvalidTokenOffsetsException to Highlighter methods
    to denote issues when offsets in TokenStream tokens exceed the length of the
    provided text.  (Mark Harwood)
    
 * LUCENE-1575, LUCENE-1483: HitCollector is now deprecated in favor of 
    a new Collector abstract class. For easy migration, people can use
    HitCollectorWrapper which translates (wraps) HitCollector into
    Collector. Note that this class is also deprecated and will be
    removed when HitCollector is removed.  Also TimeLimitedCollector
    is deprecated in favor of the new TimeLimitingCollector which
    extends Collector.  (Shai Erera, Mark Miller, Mike McCandless)

 * LUCENE-1592: The method TermsEnum.skipTo() was deprecated, because
    it is used nowhere in core/contrib and there is only a very ineffective
    default implementation available. If you want to position a TermEnum
    to another Term, create a new one using IndexReader.terms(Term).
    (Uwe Schindler)

 * LUCENE-1621: MultiTermQuery.getTerm() has been deprecated as it does
    not make sense for all subclasses of MultiTermQuery. Check individual
    subclasses to see if they support getTerm().  (Mark Miller)

 * LUCENE-1636: Make TokenFilter.input final so it's set only
    once. (Wouter Heijke, Uwe Schindler via Mike McCandless).

 * LUCENE-1658, LUCENE-1451: Renamed FSDirectory to SimpleFSDirectory
    (but left an FSDirectory base class).  Added an FSDirectory.open
    static method to pick a good default FSDirectory implementation
    given the OS. FSDirectories should now be instantiated using
    FSDirectory.open or with public constructors rather than
    FSDirectory.getDirectory(), which has been deprecated.
    (Michael McCandless, Uwe Schindler, yonik)

 * LUCENE-1665: Deprecate SortField.AUTO, to be removed in 3.0.
    Instead, when sorting by field, the application should explicitly
    state the type of the field.  (Mike McCandless)

 * LUCENE-1660: StopFilter, StandardAnalyzer, StopAnalyzer now
    require up front specification of enablePositionIncrement (Mike
    McCandless)

 * LUCENE-1614: DocIdSetIterator's next() and skipTo() were deprecated in favor
    of the new nextDoc() and advance(). The new methods return the doc Id they 
    landed on, saving an extra call to doc() in most cases.
    For easy migration of the code, you can change the calls to next() to 
    nextDoc() != DocIdSetIterator.NO_MORE_DOCS and similarly for skipTo(). 
    However it is advised that you take advantage of the returned doc ID and not 
    call doc() following those two.
    Also, doc() was deprecated in favor of docID(). docID() should return -1 or 
    NO_MORE_DOCS if nextDoc/advance were not called yet, or NO_MORE_DOCS if the 
    iterator has exhausted. Otherwise it should return the current doc ID.
    (Shai Erera via Mike McCandless)

 * LUCENE-1672: All ctors/opens and other methods using String/File to
    specify the directory in IndexReader, IndexWriter, and IndexSearcher
    were deprecated. You should instantiate the Directory manually before
    and pass it to these classes (LUCENE-1451, LUCENE-1658).
    (Uwe Schindler)

 * LUCENE-1407: Move RemoteSearchable, RemoteCachingWrapperFilter out
    of Lucene's core into new contrib/remote package.  Searchable no
    longer extends java.rmi.Remote (Simon Willnauer via Mike
    McCandless)

 * LUCENE-1677: The global property
    org.apache.lucene.SegmentReader.class, and
    ReadOnlySegmentReader.class are now deprecated, to be removed in
    3.0.  src/gcj/* has been removed. (Earwin Burrfoot via Mike
    McCandless)

 * LUCENE-1673: Deprecated NumberTools in favour of the new
    NumericRangeQuery and its new indexing format for numeric or
    date values.  (Uwe Schindler)
    
 * LUCENE-1630, LUCENE-1771: Weight is now an abstract class, and adds
    a scorer(IndexReader, boolean /* scoreDocsInOrder */, boolean /*
    topScorer */) method instead of scorer(IndexReader). IndexSearcher uses 
    this method to obtain a scorer matching the capabilities of the Collector 
    wrt orderedness of docIDs. Some Scorers (like BooleanScorer) are much more
    efficient if out-of-order documents scoring is allowed by a Collector.  
    Collector must now implement acceptsDocsOutOfOrder. If you write a 
    Collector which does not care about doc ID orderness, it is recommended 
    that you return true.  Weight has a scoresDocsOutOfOrder method, which by 
    default returns false.  If you create a Weight which will score documents 
    out of order if requested, you should override that method to return true. 
    BooleanQuery's setAllowDocsOutOfOrder and getAllowDocsOutOfOrder have been 
    deprecated as they are not needed anymore. BooleanQuery will now score docs 
    out of order when used with a Collector that can accept docs out of order.
    Finally, Weight#explain now takes a sub-reader and sub-docID, rather than
    a top level reader and docID.
    (Shai Erera, Chris Hostetter, Martin Ruckli, Mark Miller via Mike McCandless)
 	
 * LUCENE-1466, LUCENE-1906: Added CharFilter and MappingCharFilter, which allows
    chaining & mapping of characters before tokenizers run. CharStream (subclass of
    Reader) is the base class for custom java.io.Reader's, that support offset
    correction. Tokenizers got an additional method correctOffset() that is passed
    down to the underlying CharStream if input is a subclass of CharStream/-Filter.
    (Koji Sekiguchi via Mike McCandless, Uwe Schindler)

 * LUCENE-1703: Add IndexWriter.waitForMerges.  (Tim Smith via Mike
    McCandless)

 * LUCENE-1625: CheckIndex's programmatic API now returns separate
    classes detailing the status of each component in the index, and
    includes more detailed status than previously.  (Tim Smith via
    Mike McCandless)

 * LUCENE-1713: Deprecated RangeQuery and RangeFilter and renamed to
    TermRangeQuery and TermRangeFilter. TermRangeQuery is in constant
    score auto rewrite mode by default. The new classes also have new
    ctors taking field and term ranges as Strings (see also
    LUCENE-1424).  (Uwe Schindler)

 * LUCENE-1609: The termInfosIndexDivisor must now be specified
    up-front when opening the IndexReader.  Attempts to call
    IndexReader.setTermInfosIndexDivisor will hit an
    UnsupportedOperationException.  This was done to enable removal of
    all synchronization in TermInfosReader, which previously could
    cause threads to pile up in certain cases. (Dan Rosher via Mike
    McCandless)
    
 * LUCENE-1688: Deprecate static final String stop word array in and 
    StopAnalzyer and replace it with an immutable implementation of 
    CharArraySet.  (Simon Willnauer via Mark Miller)

 * LUCENE-1742: SegmentInfos, SegmentInfo and SegmentReader have been
    made public as expert, experimental APIs.  These APIs may suddenly
    change from release to release (Jason Rutherglen via Mike
    McCandless).
    
 * LUCENE-1754: QueryWeight.scorer() can return null if no documents
    are going to be matched by the query. Similarly,
    Filter.getDocIdSet() can return null if no documents are going to
    be accepted by the Filter. Note that these 'can' return null,
    however they don't have to and can return a Scorer/DocIdSet which
    does not match / reject all documents.  This is already the
    behavior of some QueryWeight/Filter implementations, and is
    documented here just for emphasis. (Shai Erera via Mike
    McCandless)

 * LUCENE-1705: Added IndexWriter.deleteAllDocuments.  (Tim Smith via
    Mike McCandless)

 * LUCENE-1460: Changed TokenStreams/TokenFilters in contrib to
    use the new TokenStream API. (Robert Muir, Michael Busch)

 * LUCENE-1748: LUCENE-1001 introduced PayloadSpans, but this was a back
    compat break and caused custom SpanQuery implementations to fail at runtime
    in a variety of ways. This issue attempts to remedy things by causing
    a compile time break on custom SpanQuery implementations and removing 
    the PayloadSpans class, with its functionality now moved to Spans. To
    help in alleviating future back compat pain, Spans has been changed from
    an interface to an abstract class.
    (Hugh Cayless, Mark Miller)
    
 * LUCENE-1808: Query.createWeight has been changed from protected to
    public. (Tim Smith, Shai Erera via Mark Miller)

 * LUCENE-1826: Add constructors that take AttributeSource and
    AttributeFactory to all Tokenizer implementations.
    (Michael Busch)
    
 * LUCENE-1847: Similarity#idf for both a Term and Term Collection have
    been deprecated. New versions that return an IDFExplanation have been
    added.  (Yasoja Seneviratne, Mike McCandless, Mark Miller)
    
 * LUCENE-1877: Made NativeFSLockFactory the default for
    the new FSDirectory API (open(), FSDirectory subclass ctors).
    All FSDirectory system properties were deprecated and all lock
    implementations use no lock prefix if the locks are stored inside
    the index directory. Because the deprecated String/File ctors of
    IndexWriter and IndexReader (LUCENE-1672) and FSDirectory.getDirectory()
    still use the old SimpleFSLockFactory and the new API
    NativeFSLockFactory, we strongly recommend not to mix deprecated
    and new API. (Uwe Schindler, Mike McCandless)

 * LUCENE-1911: Added a new method isCacheable() to DocIdSet. This method
    should return true, if the underlying implementation does not use disk
    I/O and is fast enough to be directly cached by CachingWrapperFilter.
    OpenBitSet, SortedVIntList, and DocIdBitSet are such candidates.
    The default implementation of the abstract DocIdSet class returns false.
    In this case, CachingWrapperFilter copies the DocIdSetIterator into an
    OpenBitSet for caching.  (Uwe Schindler, Thomas Becker)

Bug fixes

 * LUCENE-1415: MultiPhraseQuery has incorrect hashCode() and equals()
   implementation - Leads to Solr Cache misses. 
   (Todd Feak, Mark Miller via yonik)

 * LUCENE-1327: Fix TermSpans#skipTo() to behave as specified in javadocs
   of Terms#skipTo(). (Michael Busch)

 * LUCENE-1573: Do not ignore InterruptedException (caused by
   Thread.interrupt()) nor enter deadlock/spin loop. Now, an interrupt
   will cause a RuntimeException to be thrown.  In 3.0 we will change
   public APIs to throw InterruptedException.  (Jeremy Volkman via
   Mike McCandless)

 * LUCENE-1590: Fixed stored-only Field instances do not change the
   value of omitNorms, omitTermFreqAndPositions in FieldInfo; when you
   retrieve such fields they will now have omitNorms=true and
   omitTermFreqAndPositions=false (though these values are unused).
   (Uwe Schindler via Mike McCandless)

 * LUCENE-1587: RangeQuery#equals() could consider a RangeQuery
   without a collator equal to one with a collator.
   (Mark Platvoet via Mark Miller) 

 * LUCENE-1600: Don't call String.intern unnecessarily in some cases
   when loading documents from the index.  (P Eger via Mike
   McCandless)

 * LUCENE-1611: Fix case where OutOfMemoryException in IndexWriter
   could cause "infinite merging" to happen.  (Christiaan Fluit via
   Mike McCandless)

 * LUCENE-1623: Properly handle back-compatibility of 2.3.x indexes that
   contain field names with non-ascii characters.  (Mike Streeton via
   Mike McCandless)

 * LUCENE-1593: MultiSearcher and ParallelMultiSearcher did not break ties (in 
   sort) by doc Id in a consistent manner (i.e., if Sort.FIELD_DOC was used vs. 
   when it wasn't). (Shai Erera via Michael McCandless)

 * LUCENE-1647: Fix case where IndexReader.undeleteAll would cause
    the segment's deletion count to be incorrect. (Mike McCandless)

 * LUCENE-1542: When the first token(s) have 0 position increment,
    IndexWriter used to incorrectly record the position as -1, if no
    payload is present, or Integer.MAX_VALUE if a payload is present.
    This causes positional queries to fail to match.  The bug is now
    fixed, but if your app relies on the buggy behavior then you must
    call IndexWriter.setAllowMinus1Position().  That API is deprecated
    so you must fix your application, and rebuild your index, to not
    rely on this behavior by the 3.0 release of Lucene. (Jonathan
    Mamou, Mark Miller via Mike McCandless)

 * LUCENE-1658: Fixed MMapDirectory to correctly throw IOExceptions
    on EOF, removed numeric overflow possibilities and added support
    for a hack to unmap the buffers on closing IndexInput.
    (Uwe Schindler)
    
 * LUCENE-1681: Fix infinite loop caused by a call to DocValues methods 
    getMinValue, getMaxValue, getAverageValue. (Simon Willnauer via Mark Miller)

 * LUCENE-1599: Add clone support for SpanQuerys. SpanRegexQuery counts
    on this functionality and does not work correctly without it.
    (Billow Gao, Mark Miller)

 * LUCENE-1718: Fix termInfosIndexDivisor to carry over to reopened
    readers (Mike McCandless)
    
 * LUCENE-1583: SpanOrQuery skipTo() doesn't always move forwards as Spans
	documentation indicates it should.  (Moti Nisenson via Mark Miller)

 * LUCENE-1566: Sun JVM Bug
    http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=6478546 causes
    invalid OutOfMemoryError when reading too many bytes at once from
    a file on 32bit JVMs that have a large maximum heap size.  This
    fix adds set/getReadChunkSize to FSDirectory so that large reads
    are broken into chunks, to work around this JVM bug.  On 32bit
    JVMs the default chunk size is 100 MB; on 64bit JVMs, which don't
    show the bug, the default is Integer.MAX_VALUE. (Simon Willnauer
    via Mike McCandless)
    
 * LUCENE-1448: Added TokenStream.end() to perform end-of-stream
    operations (ie to return the end offset of the tokenization).  
    This is important when multiple fields with the same name are added
    to a document, to ensure offsets recorded in term vectors for all 
    of the instances are correct.  
    (Mike McCandless, Mark Miller, Michael Busch)

 * LUCENE-1805: CloseableThreadLocal did not allow a null Object in get(), 
    although it does allow it in set(Object). Fix get() to not assert the object
    is not null. (Shai Erera via Mike McCandless)
    
 * LUCENE-1801: Changed all Tokenizers or TokenStreams in core/contrib)
    that are the source of Tokens to always call
    AttributeSource.clearAttributes() first. (Uwe Schindler)
    
 * LUCENE-1819: MatchAllDocsQuery.toString(field) should produce output
    that is parsable by the QueryParser.  (John Wang, Mark Miller)

 * LUCENE-1836: Fix localization bug in the new query parser and add 
    new LocalizedTestCase as base class for localization junit tests.
    (Robert Muir, Uwe Schindler via Michael Busch)

 * LUCENE-1847: PhraseQuery/TermQuery/SpanQuery use IndexReader specific stats 
    in their Weight#explain methods - these stats should be corpus wide.
    (Yasoja Seneviratne, Mike McCandless, Mark Miller)

 * LUCENE-1885: Fix the bug that NativeFSLock.isLocked() did not work,
    if the lock was obtained by another NativeFSLock(Factory) instance.
    Because of this IndexReader.isLocked() and IndexWriter.isLocked() did
    not work correctly.  (Uwe Schindler)

 * LUCENE-1899: Fix O(N^2) CPU cost when setting docIDs in order in an
    OpenBitSet, due to an inefficiency in how the underlying storage is
    reallocated.  (Nadav Har'El via Mike McCandless)

 * LUCENE-1918: Fixed cases where a ParallelReader would
   generate exceptions on being passed to
   IndexWriter.addIndexes(IndexReader[]).  First case was when the
   ParallelReader was empty.  Second case was when the ParallelReader
   used to contain documents with TermVectors, but all such documents
   have been deleted. (Christian Kohlschütter via Mike McCandless)

New features

 * LUCENE-1411: Added expert API to open an IndexWriter on a prior
    commit, obtained from IndexReader.listCommits.  This makes it
    possible to rollback changes to an index even after you've closed
    the IndexWriter that made the changes, assuming you are using an
    IndexDeletionPolicy that keeps past commits around.  This is useful
    when building transactional support on top of Lucene.  (Mike
    McCandless)

 * LUCENE-1382: Add an optional arbitrary Map (String -> String)
    "commitUserData" to IndexWriter.commit(), which is stored in the
    segments file and is then retrievable via
    IndexReader.getCommitUserData instance and static methods.
    (Shalin Shekhar Mangar via Mike McCandless)

 * LUCENE-1420: Similarity now has a computeNorm method that allows
    custom Similarity classes to override how norm is computed.  It's
    provided a FieldInvertState instance that contains details from
    inverting the field.  The default impl is boost *
    lengthNorm(numTerms), to be backwards compatible.  Also added
    {set/get}DiscountOverlaps to DefaultSimilarity, to control whether
    overlapping tokens (tokens with 0 position increment) should be
    counted in lengthNorm.  (Andrzej Bialecki via Mike McCandless)

 * LUCENE-1424: Moved constant score query rewrite capability into
    MultiTermQuery, allowing TermRangeQuery, PrefixQuery and WildcardQuery
    to switch between constant-score rewriting or BooleanQuery
    expansion rewriting via a new setRewriteMethod method.
    Deprecated ConstantScoreRangeQuery (Mark Miller via Mike
    McCandless)

 * LUCENE-1461: Added FieldCacheRangeFilter, a RangeFilter for
    single-term fields that uses FieldCache to compute the filter.  If
    your documents all have a single term for a given field, and you
    need to create many RangeFilters with varying lower/upper bounds,
    then this is likely a much faster way to create the filters than
    RangeFilter.  FieldCacheRangeFilter allows ranges on all data types,
    FieldCache supports (term ranges, byte, short, int, long, float, double).
    However, it comes at the expense of added RAM consumption and slower
    first-time usage due to populating the FieldCache.  It also does not
    support collation  (Tim Sturge, Matt Ericson via Mike McCandless and
    Uwe Schindler)

 * LUCENE-1296: add protected method CachingWrapperFilter.docIdSetToCache 
    to allow subclasses to choose which DocIdSet implementation to use
    (Paul Elschot via Mike McCandless)
    
 * LUCENE-1390: Added ASCIIFoldingFilter, a Filter that converts 
    alphabetic, numeric, and symbolic Unicode characters which are not in 
    the first 127 ASCII characters (the "Basic Latin" Unicode block) into 
    their ASCII equivalents, if one exists. ISOLatin1AccentFilter, which
    handles a subset of this filter, has been deprecated.
    (Andi Vajda, Steven Rowe via Mark Miller)

 * LUCENE-1478: Added new SortField constructor allowing you to
    specify a custom FieldCache parser to generate numeric values from
    terms for a field.  (Uwe Schindler via Mike McCandless)

 * LUCENE-1528: Add support for Ideographic Space to the queryparser.
    (Luis Alves via Michael Busch)

 * LUCENE-1487: Added FieldCacheTermsFilter, to filter by multiple
    terms on single-valued fields.  The filter loads the FieldCache
    for the field the first time it's called, and subsequent usage of
    that field, even with different Terms in the filter, are fast.
    (Tim Sturge, Shalin Shekhar Mangar via Mike McCandless).

 * LUCENE-1314: Add clone(), clone(boolean readOnly) and
    reopen(boolean readOnly) to IndexReader.  Cloning an IndexReader
    gives you a new reader which you can make changes to (deletions,
    norms) without affecting the original reader.  Now, with clone or
    reopen you can change the readOnly of the original reader.  (Jason
    Rutherglen, Mike McCandless)

 * LUCENE-1506: Added FilteredDocIdSet, an abstract class which you
    subclass to implement the "match" method to accept or reject each
    docID.  Unlike ChainedFilter (under contrib/misc),
    FilteredDocIdSet never requires you to materialize the full
    bitset.  Instead, match() is called on demand per docID.  (John
    Wang via Mike McCandless)

 * LUCENE-1398: Add ReverseStringFilter to contrib/analyzers, a filter
    to reverse the characters in each token.  (Koji Sekiguchi via yonik)

 * LUCENE-1551: Add expert IndexReader.reopen(IndexCommit) to allow
    efficiently opening a new reader on a specific commit, sharing
    resources with the original reader.  (Torin Danil via Mike
    McCandless)

 * LUCENE-1434: Added org.apache.lucene.util.IndexableBinaryStringTools,
    to encode byte[] as String values that are valid terms, and
    maintain sort order of the original byte[] when the bytes are
    interpreted as unsigned.  (Steven Rowe via Mike McCandless)

 * LUCENE-1543: Allow MatchAllDocsQuery to optionally use norms from
    a specific fields to set the score for a document.  (Karl Wettin
    via Mike McCandless)

 * LUCENE-1586: Add IndexReader.getUniqueTermCount().  (Mike
    McCandless via Derek)

 * LUCENE-1516: Added "near real-time search" to IndexWriter, via a
    new expert getReader() method.  This method returns a reader that
    searches the full index, including any uncommitted changes in the
    current IndexWriter session.  This should result in a faster
    turnaround than the normal approach of commiting the changes and
    then reopening a reader.  (Jason Rutherglen via Mike McCandless)

 * LUCENE-1603: Added new MultiTermQueryWrapperFilter, to wrap any
    MultiTermQuery as a Filter.  Also made some improvements to
    MultiTermQuery: return DocIdSet.EMPTY_DOCIDSET if there are no
    terms in the enum; track the total number of terms it visited
    during rewrite (getTotalNumberOfTerms).  FilteredTermEnum is also
    more friendly to subclassing.  (Uwe Schindler via Mike McCandless)

 * LUCENE-1605: Added BitVector.subset().  (Jeremy Volkman via Mike
    McCandless)
    
 * LUCENE-1618: Added FileSwitchDirectory that enables files with
    specified extensions to be stored in a primary directory and the
    rest of the files to be stored in the secondary directory.  For
    example, this can be useful for the large doc-store (stored
    fields, term vectors) files in FSDirectory and the rest of the
    index files in a RAMDirectory. (Jason Rutherglen via Mike
    McCandless)

 * LUCENE-1494: Added FieldMaskingSpanQuery which can be used to
    cross-correlate Spans from different fields.
    (Paul Cowan and Chris Hostetter)

 * LUCENE-1634: Add calibrateSizeByDeletes to LogMergePolicy, to take
    deletions into account when considering merges.  (Yasuhiro Matsuda
    via Mike McCandless)

 * LUCENE-1550: Added new n-gram based String distance measure for spell checking.
    See the Javadocs for NGramDistance.java for a reference paper on why
    this is helpful (Tom Morton via Grant Ingersoll)

 * LUCENE-1470, LUCENE-1582, LUCENE-1602, LUCENE-1673, LUCENE-1701, LUCENE-1712:
    Added NumericRangeQuery and NumericRangeFilter, a fast alternative to
    RangeQuery/RangeFilter for numeric searches. They depend on a specific
    structure of terms in the index that can be created by indexing
    using the new NumericField or NumericTokenStream classes. NumericField
    can only be used for indexing and optionally stores the values as
    string representation in the doc store. Documents returned from
    IndexReader/IndexSearcher will return only the String value using
    the standard Fieldable interface. NumericFields can be sorted on
    and loaded into the FieldCache.  (Uwe Schindler, Yonik Seeley,
    Mike McCandless)

 * LUCENE-1405: Added support for Ant resource collections in contrib/ant
    <index> task.  (Przemyslaw Sztoch via Erik Hatcher)

 * LUCENE-1699: Allow setting a TokenStream on Field/Fieldable for indexing
    in conjunction with any other ways to specify stored field values,
    currently binary or string values.  (yonik)
    
 * LUCENE-1701: Made the standard FieldCache.Parsers public and added
    parsers for fields generated using NumericField/NumericTokenStream.
    All standard parsers now also implement Serializable and enforce
    their singleton status.  (Uwe Schindler, Mike McCandless)
    
 * LUCENE-1741: User configurable maximum chunk size in MMapDirectory.
    On 32 bit platforms, the address space can be very fragmented, so
    one big ByteBuffer for the whole file may not fit into address space.
    (Eks Dev via Uwe Schindler)

 * LUCENE-1644: Enable 4 rewrite modes for queries deriving from
    MultiTermQuery (WildcardQuery, PrefixQuery, TermRangeQuery,
    NumericRangeQuery): CONSTANT_SCORE_FILTER_REWRITE first creates a
    filter and then assigns constant score (boost) to docs;
    CONSTANT_SCORE_BOOLEAN_QUERY_REWRITE create a BooleanQuery but
    uses a constant score (boost); SCORING_BOOLEAN_QUERY_REWRITE also
    creates a BooleanQuery but keeps the BooleanQuery's scores;
    CONSTANT_SCORE_AUTO_REWRITE tries to pick the most performant
    constant-score rewrite method.  (Mike McCandless)
    
 * LUCENE-1448: Added TokenStream.end(), to perform end-of-stream
    operations.  This is currently used to fix offset problems when 
    multiple fields with the same name are added to a document.
    (Mike McCandless, Mark Miller, Michael Busch)
 
 * LUCENE-1776: Add an option to not collect payloads for an ordered
    SpanNearQuery. Payloads were not lazily loaded in this case as
    the javadocs implied. If you have payloads and want to use an ordered
    SpanNearQuery that does not need to use the payloads, you can
    disable loading them with a new constructor switch.  (Mark Miller)

 * LUCENE-1341: Added PayloadNearQuery to enable SpanNearQuery functionality
    with payloads (Peter Keegan, Grant Ingersoll, Mark Miller)

 * LUCENE-1790: Added PayloadTermQuery to enable scoring of payloads
    based on the maximum payload seen for a document.
    Slight refactoring of Similarity and other payload queries (Grant Ingersoll, Mark Miller)

 * LUCENE-1749: Addition of FieldCacheSanityChecker utility, and
    hooks to use it in all existing Lucene Tests.  This class can
    be used by any application to inspect the FieldCache and provide
    diagnostic information about the possibility of inconsistent
    FieldCache usage.  Namely: FieldCache entries for the same field
    with different datatypes or parsers; and FieldCache entries for
    the same field in both a reader, and one of it's (descendant) sub
    readers. 
    (Chris Hostetter, Mark Miller)

 * LUCENE-1789: Added utility class
    oal.search.function.MultiValueSource to ease the transition to
    segment based searching for any apps that directly call
    oal.search.function.* APIs.  This class wraps any other
    ValueSource, but takes care when composite (multi-segment) are
    passed to not double RAM usage in the FieldCache.  (Chris
    Hostetter, Mark Miller, Mike McCandless)
    
Optimizations

 * LUCENE-1427: Fixed QueryWrapperFilter to not waste time computing
    scores of the query, since they are just discarded.  Also, made it
    more efficient (single pass) by not creating & populating an
    intermediate OpenBitSet (Paul Elschot, Mike McCandless)

 * LUCENE-1443: Performance improvement for OpenBitSetDISI.inPlaceAnd()
    (Paul Elschot via yonik)

 * LUCENE-1484: Remove synchronization of IndexReader.document() by
    using CloseableThreadLocal internally.  (Jason Rutherglen via Mike
    McCandless).
    
 * LUCENE-1124: Short circuit FuzzyQuery.rewrite when input token length 
    is small compared to minSimilarity. (Timo Nentwig, Mark Miller)

 * LUCENE-1316: MatchAllDocsQuery now avoids the synchronized
    IndexReader.isDeleted() call per document, by directly accessing
    the underlying deleteDocs BitVector.  This improves performance
    with non-readOnly readers, especially in a multi-threaded
    environment.  (Todd Feak, Yonik Seeley, Jason Rutherglen via Mike
    McCandless)

 * LUCENE-1483: When searching over multiple segments we now visit
    each sub-reader one at a time.  This speeds up warming, since
    FieldCache entries (if required) can be shared across reopens for
    those segments that did not change, and also speeds up searches
    that sort by relevance or by field values.  (Mark Miller, Mike
    McCandless)
    
 * LUCENE-1575: The new Collector class decouples collect() from
    score computation.  Collector.setScorer is called to establish the
    current Scorer in-use per segment.  Collectors that require the
    score should then call Scorer.score() per hit inside
    collect(). (Shai Erera via Mike McCandless)

 * LUCENE-1596: MultiTermDocs speedup when set with
    MultiTermDocs.seek(MultiTermEnum) (yonik)
    
 * LUCENE-1653: Avoid creating a Calendar in every call to 
    DateTools#dateToString, DateTools#timeToString and
    DateTools#round.  (Shai Erera via Mark Miller)
    
 * LUCENE-1688: Deprecate static final String stop word array and 
    replace it with an immutable implementation of CharArraySet.
    Removes conversions between Set and array.
    (Simon Willnauer via Mark Miller)

 * LUCENE-1754: BooleanQuery.queryWeight.scorer() will return null if
    it won't match any documents (e.g. if there are no required and
    optional scorers, or not enough optional scorers to satisfy
    minShouldMatch).  (Shai Erera via Mike McCandless)

 * LUCENE-1607: To speed up string interning for commonly used
    strings, the StringHelper.intern() interface was added with a
    default implementation that uses a lockless cache.
    (Earwin Burrfoot, yonik)

 * LUCENE-1800: QueryParser should use reusable TokenStreams. (yonik)
    

Documentation

 * LUCENE-1908: Scoring documentation imrovements in Similarity javadocs. 
   (Mark Miller, Shai Erera, Ted Dunning, Jiri Kuhn, Marvin Humphrey, Doron Cohen)
    
 * LUCENE-1872: NumericField javadoc improvements
    (Michael McCandless, Uwe Schindler)
 
 * LUCENE-1875: Make TokenStream.end javadoc less confusing.
    (Uwe Schindler)

 * LUCENE-1862: Rectified duplicate package level javadocs for
    o.a.l.queryParser and o.a.l.analysis.cn.
    (Chris Hostetter)

 * LUCENE-1886: Improved hyperlinking in key Analysis javadocs
    (Bernd Fondermann via Chris Hostetter)

 * LUCENE-1884: massive javadoc and comment cleanup, primarily dealing with
    typos.
    (Robert Muir via Chris Hostetter)
    
 * LUCENE-1898: Switch changes to use bullets rather than numbers and 
    update changes-to-html script to handle the new format. 
    (Steven Rowe, Mark Miller)
    
 * LUCENE-1900: Improve Searchable Javadoc.
    (Nadav Har'El, Doron Cohen, Marvin Humphrey, Mark Miller)
    
 * LUCENE-1896: Improve Similarity#queryNorm javadocs.
    (Jiri Kuhn, Mark Miller)

Build

 * LUCENE-1440: Add new targets to build.xml that allow downloading
    and executing the junit testcases from an older release for
    backwards-compatibility testing. (Michael Busch)

 * LUCENE-1446: Add compatibility tag to common-build.xml and run 
    backwards-compatibility tests in the nightly build. (Michael Busch)

 * LUCENE-1529: Properly test "drop-in" replacement of jar with 
    backwards-compatibility tests. (Mike McCandless, Michael Busch)

 * LUCENE-1851: Change 'javacc' and 'clean-javacc' targets to build
    and clean contrib/surround files. (Luis Alves via Michael Busch)

 * LUCENE-1854: tar task should use longfile="gnu" to avoid false file
    name length warnings.  (Mark Miller)

Test Cases

 * LUCENE-1791: Enhancements to the QueryUtils and CheckHits utility 
    classes to wrap IndexReaders and Searchers in MultiReaders or 
    MultiSearcher when possible to help exercise more edge cases.
    (Chris Hostetter, Mark Miller)

 * LUCENE-1852: Fix localization test failures. 
    (Robert Muir via Michael Busch)
    
 * LUCENE-1843: Refactored all tests that use assertAnalyzesTo() & others
    in core and contrib to use a new BaseTokenStreamTestCase
    base class. Also rewrote some tests to use this general analysis assert
    functions instead of own ones (e.g. TestMappingCharFilter).
    The new base class also tests tokenization with the TokenStream.next()
    backwards layer enabled (using Token/TokenWrapper as attribute
    implementation) and disabled (default for Lucene 3.0)
    (Uwe Schindler, Robert Muir)
    
 * LUCENE-1836: Added a new LocalizedTestCase as base class for localization
    junit tests.  (Robert Muir, Uwe Schindler via Michael Busch)

======================= Release 2.4.1 =======================

API Changes

1. LUCENE-1186: Add Analyzer.close() to free internal ThreadLocal
   resources.  (Christian Kohlschütter via Mike McCandless)

Bug fixes

1. LUCENE-1452: Fixed silent data-loss case whereby binary fields are
   truncated to 0 bytes during merging if the segments being merged
   are non-congruent (same field name maps to different field
   numbers).  This bug was introduced with LUCENE-1219.  (Andrzej
   Bialecki via Mike McCandless).

2. LUCENE-1429: Don't throw incorrect IllegalStateException from
   IndexWriter.close() if you've hit an OOM when autoCommit is true.
   (Mike McCandless)

3. LUCENE-1474: If IndexReader.flush() is called twice when there were
   pending deletions, it could lead to later false AssertionError
   during IndexReader.open.  (Mike McCandless)

4. LUCENE-1430: Fix false AlreadyClosedException from IndexReader.open
   (masking an actual IOException) that takes String or File path.
   (Mike McCandless)

5. LUCENE-1442: Multiple-valued NOT_ANALYZED fields can double-count
   token offsets.  (Mike McCandless)

6. LUCENE-1453: Ensure IndexReader.reopen()/clone() does not result in
   incorrectly closing the shared FSDirectory. This bug would only
   happen if you use IndexReader.open() with a File or String argument.
   The returned readers are wrapped by a FilterIndexReader that
   correctly handles closing of directory after reopen()/clone(). 
   (Mark Miller, Uwe Schindler, Mike McCandless)

7. LUCENE-1457: Fix possible overflow bugs during binary
   searches. (Mark Miller via Mike McCandless)

8. LUCENE-1459: Fix CachingWrapperFilter to not throw exception if
   both bits() and getDocIdSet() methods are called. (Matt Jones via
   Mike McCandless)

9. LUCENE-1519: Fix int overflow bug during segment merging.  (Deepak
   via Mike McCandless)

10. LUCENE-1521: Fix int overflow bug when flushing segment.
    (Shon Vella via Mike McCandless).

11. LUCENE-1544: Fix deadlock in IndexWriter.addIndexes(IndexReader[]).
    (Mike McCandless via Doug Sale)

12. LUCENE-1547: Fix rare thread safety issue if two threads call
    IndexWriter commit() at the same time.  (Mike McCandless)

13. LUCENE-1465: NearSpansOrdered returns payloads from first possible match 
    rather than the correct, shortest match; Payloads could be returned even
    if the max slop was exceeded; The wrong payload could be returned in 
    certain situations. (Jonathan Mamou, Greg Shackles, Mark Miller)

14. LUCENE-1186: Add Analyzer.close() to free internal ThreadLocal
    resources.  (Christian Kohlschütter via Mike McCandless)

15. LUCENE-1552: Fix IndexWriter.addIndexes(IndexReader[]) to properly
    rollback IndexWriter's internal state on hitting an
    exception. (Scott Garland via Mike McCandless)

======================= Release 2.4.0 =======================

Changes in backwards compatibility policy

1. LUCENE-1340: In a minor change to Lucene's backward compatibility
   policy, we are now allowing the Fieldable interface to have
   changes, within reason, and made on a case-by-case basis.  If an
   application implements it's own Fieldable, please be aware of
   this.  Otherwise, no need to be concerned.  This is in effect for
   all 2.X releases, starting with 2.4.  Also note, that in all
   likelihood, Fieldable will be changed in 3.0.


Changes in runtime behavior

 1. LUCENE-1151: Fix StandardAnalyzer to not mis-identify host names
    (eg lucene.apache.org) as an ACRONYM.  To get back to the pre-2.4
    backwards compatible, but buggy, behavior, you can either call
    StandardAnalyzer.setDefaultReplaceInvalidAcronym(false) (static
    method), or, set system property
    org.apache.lucene.analysis.standard.StandardAnalyzer.replaceInvalidAcronym
    to "false" on JVM startup.  All StandardAnalyzer instances created
    after that will then show the pre-2.4 behavior.  Alternatively,
    you can call setReplaceInvalidAcronym(false) to change the
    behavior per instance of StandardAnalyzer.  This backwards
    compatibility will be removed in 3.0 (hardwiring the value to
    true).  (Mike McCandless)

 2. LUCENE-1044: IndexWriter with autoCommit=true now commits (such
    that a reader can see the changes) far less often than it used to.
    Previously, every flush was also a commit.  You can always force a
    commit by calling IndexWriter.commit().  Furthermore, in 3.0,
    autoCommit will be hardwired to false (IndexWriter constructors
    that take an autoCommit argument have been deprecated) (Mike
    McCandless)

 3. LUCENE-1335: IndexWriter.addIndexes(Directory[]) and
    addIndexesNoOptimize no longer allow the same Directory instance
    to be passed in more than once.  Internally, IndexWriter uses
    Directory and segment name to uniquely identify segments, so
    adding the same Directory more than once was causing duplicates
    which led to problems (Mike McCandless)

 4. LUCENE-1396: Improve PhraseQuery.toString() so that gaps in the
    positions are indicated with a ? and multiple terms at the same
    position are joined with a |.  (Andrzej Bialecki via Mike
    McCandless)

API Changes

 1. LUCENE-1084: Changed all IndexWriter constructors to take an
    explicit parameter for maximum field size.  Deprecated all the
    pre-existing constructors; these will be removed in release 3.0.
    NOTE: these new constructors set autoCommit to false.  (Steven
    Rowe via Mike McCandless)

 2. LUCENE-584: Changed Filter API to return a DocIdSet instead of a
    java.util.BitSet. This allows using more efficient data structures
    for Filters and makes them more flexible. This deprecates
    Filter.bits(), so all filters that implement this outside
    the Lucene code base will need to be adapted. See also the javadocs
    of the Filter class. (Paul Elschot, Michael Busch)

 3. LUCENE-1044: Added IndexWriter.commit() which flushes any buffered
    adds/deletes and then commits a new segments file so readers will
    see the changes.  Deprecate IndexWriter.flush() in favor of
    IndexWriter.commit().  (Mike McCandless)

 4. LUCENE-325: Added IndexWriter.expungeDeletes methods, which
    consult the MergePolicy to find merges necessary to merge away all
    deletes from the index.  This should be a somewhat lower cost
    operation than optimize.  (John Wang via Mike McCandless)

 5. LUCENE-1233: Return empty array instead of null when no fields
    match the specified name in these methods in Document:
    getFieldables, getFields, getValues, getBinaryValues.  (Stefan
    Trcek vai Mike McCandless)

 6. LUCENE-1234: Make BoostingSpanScorer protected.  (Andi Vajda via Grant Ingersoll)

 7. LUCENE-510: The index now stores strings as true UTF-8 bytes
    (previously it was Java's modified UTF-8).  If any text, either
    stored fields or a token, has illegal UTF-16 surrogate characters,
    these characters are now silently replaced with the Unicode
    replacement character U+FFFD.  This is a change to the index file
    format.  (Marvin Humphrey via Mike McCandless)

 8. LUCENE-852: Let the SpellChecker caller specify IndexWriter mergeFactor
    and RAM buffer size.  (Otis Gospodnetic)
	
 9. LUCENE-1290: Deprecate org.apache.lucene.search.Hits, Hit and HitIterator
    and remove all references to these classes from the core. Also update demos
    and tutorials. (Michael Busch)

10. LUCENE-1288: Add getVersion() and getGeneration() to IndexCommit.
    getVersion() returns the same value that IndexReader.getVersion()
    returns when the reader is opened on the same commit.  (Jason
    Rutherglen via Mike McCandless)

11. LUCENE-1311: Added IndexReader.listCommits(Directory) static
    method to list all commits in a Directory, plus IndexReader.open
    methods that accept an IndexCommit and open the index as of that
    commit.  These methods are only useful if you implement a custom
    DeletionPolicy that keeps more than the last commit around.
    (Jason Rutherglen via Mike McCandless)

12. LUCENE-1325: Added IndexCommit.isOptimized().  (Shalin Shekhar
    Mangar via Mike McCandless)

13. LUCENE-1324: Added TokenFilter.reset(). (Shai Erera via Mike
    McCandless)

14. LUCENE-1340: Added Fieldable.omitTf() method to skip indexing term
    frequency, positions and payloads.  This saves index space, and
    indexing/searching time.  (Eks Dev via Mike McCandless)

15. LUCENE-1219: Add basic reuse API to Fieldable for binary fields:
    getBinaryValue/Offset/Length(); currently only lazy fields reuse
    the provided byte[] result to getBinaryValue.  (Eks Dev via Mike
    McCandless)

16. LUCENE-1334: Add new constructor for Term: Term(String fieldName)
    which defaults term text to "".  (DM Smith via Mike McCandless)

17. LUCENE-1333: Added Token.reinit(*) APIs to re-initialize (reuse) a
    Token.  Also added term() method to return a String, with a
    performance penalty clearly documented.  Also implemented
    hashCode() and equals() in Token, and fixed all core and contrib
    analyzers to use the re-use APIs.  (DM Smith via Mike McCandless)

18. LUCENE-1329: Add optional readOnly boolean when opening an
    IndexReader.  A readOnly reader is not allowed to make changes
    (deletions, norms) to the index; in exchanged, the isDeleted
    method, often a bottleneck when searching with many threads, is
    not synchronized.  The default for readOnly is still false, but in
    3.0 the default will become true.  (Jason Rutherglen via Mike
    McCandless)

19. LUCENE-1367: Add IndexCommit.isDeleted().  (Shalin Shekhar Mangar
    via Mike McCandless)

20. LUCENE-1061: Factored out all "new XXXQuery(...)" in
    QueryParser.java into protected methods newXXXQuery(...) so that
    subclasses can create their own subclasses of each Query type.
    (John Wang via Mike McCandless)

21. LUCENE-753: Added new Directory implementation
    org.apache.lucene.store.NIOFSDirectory, which uses java.nio's
    FileChannel to do file reads.  On most non-Windows platforms, with
    many threads sharing a single searcher, this may yield sizable
    improvement to query throughput when compared to FSDirectory,
    which only allows a single thread to read from an open file at a
    time.  (Jason Rutherglen via Mike McCandless)

22. LUCENE-1371: Added convenience method TopDocs Searcher.search(Query query, int n).
    (Mike McCandless)
    
23. LUCENE-1356: Allow easy extensions of TopDocCollector by turning
    constructor and fields from package to protected. (Shai Erera
    via Doron Cohen) 

24. LUCENE-1375: Added convenience method IndexCommit.getTimestamp,
    which is equivalent to
    getDirectory().fileModified(getSegmentsFileName()).  (Mike McCandless)

23. LUCENE-1366: Rename Field.Index options to be more accurate:
    TOKENIZED becomes ANALYZED;  UN_TOKENIZED becomes NOT_ANALYZED;
    NO_NORMS becomes NOT_ANALYZED_NO_NORMS and a new ANALYZED_NO_NORMS
    is added.  (Mike McCandless)

24. LUCENE-1131: Added numDeletedDocs method to IndexReader (Otis Gospodnetic)

Bug fixes
    
 1. LUCENE-1134: Fixed BooleanQuery.rewrite to only optimize a single 
    clause query if minNumShouldMatch<=0. (Shai Erera via Michael Busch)

 2. LUCENE-1169: Fixed bug in IndexSearcher.search(): searching with
    a filter might miss some hits because scorer.skipTo() is called
    without checking if the scorer is already at the right position.
    scorer.skipTo(scorer.doc()) is not a NOOP, it behaves as 
    scorer.next(). (Eks Dev, Michael Busch)

 3. LUCENE-1182: Added scorePayload to SimilarityDelegator (Andi Vajda via Grant Ingersoll)
 
 4. LUCENE-1213: MultiFieldQueryParser was ignoring slop in case
    of a single field phrase. (Trejkaz via Doron Cohen)

 5. LUCENE-1228: IndexWriter.commit() was not updating the index version and as
    result IndexReader.reopen() failed to sense index changes. (Doron Cohen)

 6. LUCENE-1267: Added numDocs() and maxDoc() to IndexWriter;
    deprecated docCount().  (Mike McCandless)

 7. LUCENE-1274: Added new prepareCommit() method to IndexWriter,
    which does phase 1 of a 2-phase commit (commit() does phase 2).
    This is needed when you want to update an index as part of a
    transaction involving external resources (eg a database).  Also
    deprecated abort(), renaming it to rollback().  (Mike McCandless)

 8. LUCENE-1003: Stop RussianAnalyzer from removing numbers.
    (TUSUR OpenTeam, Dmitry Lihachev via Otis Gospodnetic)

 9. LUCENE-1152: SpellChecker fix around clearIndex and indexDictionary
    methods, plus removal of IndexReader reference.
    (Naveen Belkale via Otis Gospodnetic)

10. LUCENE-1046: Removed dead code in SpellChecker
    (Daniel Naber via Otis Gospodnetic)
	
11. LUCENE-1189: Fixed the QueryParser to handle escaped characters within 
    quoted terms correctly. (Tomer Gabel via Michael Busch)

12. LUCENE-1299: Fixed NPE in SpellChecker when IndexReader is not null and field is (Grant Ingersoll)

13. LUCENE-1303: Fixed BoostingTermQuery's explanation to be marked as a Match 
    depending only upon the non-payload score part, regardless of the effect of 
    the payload on the score. Prior to this, score of a query containing a BTQ 
    differed from its explanation. (Doron Cohen)
    
14. LUCENE-1310: Fixed SloppyPhraseScorer to work also for terms repeating more 
    than twice in the query. (Doron Cohen)

15. LUCENE-1351: ISOLatin1AccentFilter now cleans additional ligatures (Cedrik Lime via Grant Ingersoll)

16. LUCENE-1383: Workaround a nasty "leak" in Java's builtin
    ThreadLocal, to prevent Lucene from causing unexpected
    OutOfMemoryError in certain situations (notably J2EE
    applications).  (Chris Lu via Mike McCandless)

New features

 1. LUCENE-1137: Added Token.set/getFlags() accessors for passing more information about a Token through the analysis
    process.  The flag is not indexed/stored and is thus only used by analysis.

 2. LUCENE-1147: Add -segment option to CheckIndex tool so you can
    check only a specific segment or segments in your index.  (Mike
    McCandless)

 3. LUCENE-1045: Reopened this issue to add support for short and bytes. 
 
 4. LUCENE-584: Added new data structures to o.a.l.util, such as 
    OpenBitSet and SortedVIntList. These extend DocIdSet and can 
    directly be used for Filters with the new Filter API. Also changed
    the core Filters to use OpenBitSet instead of java.util.BitSet.
    (Paul Elschot, Michael Busch)

 5. LUCENE-494: Added QueryAutoStopWordAnalyzer to allow for the automatic removal, from a query of frequently occurring terms.
    This Analyzer is not intended for use during indexing. (Mark Harwood via Grant Ingersoll)

 6. LUCENE-1044: Change Lucene to properly "sync" files after
    committing, to ensure on a machine or OS crash or power cut, even
    with cached writes, the index remains consistent.  Also added
    explicit commit() method to IndexWriter to force a commit without
    having to close.  (Mike McCandless)
    
 7. LUCENE-997: Add search timeout (partial) support.
    A TimeLimitedCollector was added to allow limiting search time.
    It is a partial solution since timeout is checked only when 
    collecting a hit, and therefore a search for rare words in a 
    huge index might not stop within the specified time.
    (Sean Timm via Doron Cohen) 

 8. LUCENE-1184: Allow SnapshotDeletionPolicy to be re-used across
    close/re-open of IndexWriter while still protecting an open
    snapshot (Tim Brennan via Mike McCandless)

 9. LUCENE-1194: Added IndexWriter.deleteDocuments(Query) to delete
    documents matching the specified query.  Also added static unlock
    and isLocked methods (deprecating the ones in IndexReader).  (Mike
    McCandless)

10. LUCENE-1201: Add IndexReader.getIndexCommit() method. (Tim Brennan
    via Mike McCandless)

11. LUCENE-550:  Added InstantiatedIndex implementation.  Experimental 
    Index store similar to MemoryIndex but allows for multiple documents 
    in memory.  (Karl Wettin via Grant Ingersoll)

12. LUCENE-400: Added word based n-gram filter (in contrib/analyzers) called ShingleFilter and an Analyzer wrapper
    that wraps another Analyzer's token stream with a ShingleFilter (Sebastian Kirsch, Steve Rowe via Grant Ingersoll) 

13. LUCENE-1166: Decomposition tokenfilter for languages like German and Swedish (Thomas Peuss via Grant Ingersoll)

14. LUCENE-1187: ChainedFilter and BooleanFilter now work with new Filter API
    and DocIdSetIterator-based filters. Backwards-compatibility with old 
    BitSet-based filters is ensured. (Paul Elschot via Michael Busch)

15. LUCENE-1295: Added new method to MoreLikeThis for retrieving interesting terms and made retrieveTerms(int) public. (Grant Ingersoll)

16. LUCENE-1298: MoreLikeThis can now accept a custom Similarity (Grant Ingersoll)

17. LUCENE-1297: Allow other string distance measures for the SpellChecker
    (Thomas Morton via Otis Gospodnetic)

18. LUCENE-1001: Provide access to Payloads via Spans.  All existing Span Query implementations in Lucene implement. (Mark Miller, Grant Ingersoll)

19. LUCENE-1354: Provide programmatic access to CheckIndex (Grant Ingersoll, Mike McCandless)

20. LUCENE-1279: Add support for Collators to RangeFilter/Query and Query Parser.  (Steve Rowe via Grant Ingersoll) 

Optimizations

 1. LUCENE-705: When building a compound file, use
    RandomAccessFile.setLength() to tell the OS/filesystem to
    pre-allocate space for the file.  This may improve fragmentation
    in how the CFS file is stored, and allows us to detect an upcoming
    disk full situation before actually filling up the disk.  (Mike
    McCandless)

 2. LUCENE-1120: Speed up merging of term vectors by bulk-copying the
    raw bytes for each contiguous range of non-deleted documents.
    (Mike McCandless)
	
 3. LUCENE-1185: Avoid checking if the TermBuffer 'scratch' in 
    SegmentTermEnum is null for every call of scanTo().
    (Christian Kohlschuetter via Michael Busch)

 4. LUCENE-1217: Internal to Field.java, use isBinary instead of
    runtime type checking for possible speedup of binaryValue().
    (Eks Dev via Mike McCandless)

 5. LUCENE-1183: Optimized TRStringDistance class (in contrib/spell) that uses
    less memory than the previous version.  (Cédrik LIME via Otis Gospodnetic)

 6. LUCENE-1195: Improve term lookup performance by adding a LRU cache to the
    TermInfosReader. In performance experiments the speedup was about 25% on 
    average on mid-size indexes with ~500,000 documents for queries with 3 
    terms and about 7% on larger indexes with ~4.3M documents. (Michael Busch)

Documentation

  1. LUCENE-1236:  Added some clarifying remarks to EdgeNGram*.java (Hiroaki Kawai via Grant Ingersoll)
  
  2. LUCENE-1157 and LUCENE-1256: HTML changes log, created automatically 
     from CHANGES.txt. This HTML file is currently visible only via developers page.     
     (Steven Rowe via Doron Cohen)

  3. LUCENE-1349: Fieldable can now be changed without breaking backward compatibility rules (within reason.  See the note at
  the top of this file and also on Fieldable.java).  (Grant Ingersoll)
  
  4. LUCENE-1873: Update documentation to reflect current Contrib area status.
     (Steven Rowe, Mark Miller)

Build

  1. LUCENE-1153: Added JUnit JAR to new lib directory.  Updated build to rely on local JUnit instead of ANT/lib.
  
  2. LUCENE-1202: Small fixes to the way Clover is used to work better
     with contribs.  Of particular note: a single clover db is used
     regardless of whether tests are run globally or in the specific
     contrib directories. 
     
  3. LUCENE-1353: Javacc target in contrib/miscellaneous for 
     generating the precedence query parser. 

Test Cases

 1. LUCENE-1238: Fixed intermittent failures of TestTimeLimitedCollector.testTimeoutMultiThreaded.
    Within this fix, "greedy" flag was added to TimeLimitedCollector, to allow the wrapped 
    collector to collect also the last doc, after allowed-tTime passed. (Doron Cohen)   
	
 2. LUCENE-1348: relax TestTimeLimitedCollector to not fail due to 
    timeout exceeded (just because test machine is very busy).
	
======================= Release 2.3.2 =======================

Bug fixes

 1. LUCENE-1191: On hitting OutOfMemoryError in any index-modifying
    methods in IndexWriter, do not commit any further changes to the
    index to prevent risk of possible corruption.  (Mike McCandless)

 2. LUCENE-1197: Fixed issue whereby IndexWriter would flush by RAM
    too early when TermVectors were in use.  (Mike McCandless)

 3. LUCENE-1198: Don't corrupt index if an exception happens inside
    DocumentsWriter.init (Mike McCandless)

 4. LUCENE-1199: Added defensive check for null indexReader before
    calling close in IndexModifier.close() (Mike McCandless)

 5. LUCENE-1200: Fix rare deadlock case in addIndexes* when
    ConcurrentMergeScheduler is in use (Mike McCandless)

 6. LUCENE-1208: Fix deadlock case on hitting an exception while
    processing a document that had triggered a flush (Mike McCandless)

 7. LUCENE-1210: Fix deadlock case on hitting an exception while
    starting a merge when using ConcurrentMergeScheduler (Mike McCandless)

 8. LUCENE-1222: Fix IndexWriter.doAfterFlush to always be called on
    flush (Mark Ferguson via Mike McCandless)
	
 9. LUCENE-1226: Fixed IndexWriter.addIndexes(IndexReader[]) to commit
    successfully created compound files. (Michael Busch)

10. LUCENE-1150: Re-expose StandardTokenizer's constants publicly;
    this was accidentally lost with LUCENE-966.  (Nicolas Lalevée via
    Mike McCandless)

11. LUCENE-1262: Fixed bug in BufferedIndexReader.refill whereby on
    hitting an exception in readInternal, the buffer is incorrectly
    filled with stale bytes such that subsequent calls to readByte()
    return incorrect results.  (Trejkaz via Mike McCandless)

12. LUCENE-1270: Fixed intermittent case where IndexWriter.close()
    would hang after IndexWriter.addIndexesNoOptimize had been
    called.  (Stu Hood via Mike McCandless)
	
Build

 1. LUCENE-1230: Include *pom.xml* in source release files. (Michael Busch)

 
======================= Release 2.3.1 =======================

Bug fixes
    
 1. LUCENE-1168: Fixed corruption cases when autoCommit=false and
    documents have mixed term vectors (Suresh Guvvala via Mike
    McCandless).

 2. LUCENE-1171: Fixed some cases where OOM errors could cause
    deadlock in IndexWriter (Mike McCandless).

 3. LUCENE-1173: Fixed corruption case when autoCommit=false and bulk
    merging of stored fields is used (Yonik via Mike McCandless).

 4. LUCENE-1163: Fixed bug in CharArraySet.contains(char[] buffer, int
    offset, int len) that was ignoring offset and thus giving the
    wrong answer.  (Thomas Peuss via Mike McCandless)
	
 5. LUCENE-1177: Fix rare case where IndexWriter.optimize might do too
    many merges at the end.  (Mike McCandless)
	
 6. LUCENE-1176: Fix corruption case when documents with no term
    vector fields are added before documents with term vector fields.
    (Mike McCandless)
	
 7. LUCENE-1179: Fixed assert statement that was incorrectly
    preventing Fields with empty-string field name from working.
    (Sergey Kabashnyuk via Mike McCandless)

======================= Release 2.3.0 =======================

Changes in runtime behavior

 1. LUCENE-994: Defaults for IndexWriter have been changed to maximize
    out-of-the-box indexing speed.  First, IndexWriter now flushes by
    RAM usage (16 MB by default) instead of a fixed doc count (call
    IndexWriter.setMaxBufferedDocs to get backwards compatible
    behavior).  Second, ConcurrentMergeScheduler is used to run merges
    using background threads (call IndexWriter.setMergeScheduler(new
    SerialMergeScheduler()) to get backwards compatible behavior).
    Third, merges are chosen based on size in bytes of each segment
    rather than document count of each segment (call
    IndexWriter.setMergePolicy(new LogDocMergePolicy()) to get
    backwards compatible behavior).

    NOTE: users of ParallelReader must change back all of these
    defaults in order to ensure the docIDs "align" across all parallel
    indices.

    (Mike McCandless)

 2. LUCENE-1045: SortField.AUTO didn't work with long. When detecting
    the field type for sorting automatically, numbers used to be
    interpreted as int, then as float, if parsing the number as an int
    failed. Now the detection checks for int, then for long,
    then for float. (Daniel Naber)

API Changes

 1. LUCENE-843: Added IndexWriter.setRAMBufferSizeMB(...) to have
    IndexWriter flush whenever the buffered documents are using more
    than the specified amount of RAM.  Also added new APIs to Token
    that allow one to set a char[] plus offset and length to specify a
    token (to avoid creating a new String() for each Token).  (Mike
    McCandless)

 2. LUCENE-963: Add setters to Field to allow for re-using a single
    Field instance during indexing.  This is a sizable performance
    gain, especially for small documents.  (Mike McCandless)

 3. LUCENE-969: Add new APIs to Token, TokenStream and Analyzer to
    permit re-using of Token and TokenStream instances during
    indexing.  Changed Token to use a char[] as the store for the
    termText instead of String.  This gives faster tokenization
    performance (~10-15%).  (Mike McCandless)

 4. LUCENE-847: Factored MergePolicy, which determines which merges
    should take place and when, as well as MergeScheduler, which
    determines when the selected merges should actually run, out of
    IndexWriter.  The default merge policy is now
    LogByteSizeMergePolicy (see LUCENE-845) and the default merge
    scheduler is now ConcurrentMergeScheduler (see
    LUCENE-870). (Steven Parkes via Mike McCandless)

 5. LUCENE-1052: Add IndexReader.setTermInfosIndexDivisor(int) method
    that allows you to reduce memory usage of the termInfos by further
    sub-sampling (over the termIndexInterval that was used during
    indexing) which terms are loaded into memory.  (Chuck Williams,
    Doug Cutting via Mike McCandless)
    
 6. LUCENE-743: Add IndexReader.reopen() method that re-opens an
    existing IndexReader (see New features -> 8.) (Michael Busch)

 7. LUCENE-1062: Add setData(byte[] data), 
    setData(byte[] data, int offset, int length), getData(), getOffset()
    and clone() methods to o.a.l.index.Payload. Also add the field name 
    as arg to Similarity.scorePayload(). (Michael Busch)

 8. LUCENE-982: Add IndexWriter.optimize(int maxNumSegments) method to
    "partially optimize" an index down to maxNumSegments segments.
    (Mike McCandless)

 9. LUCENE-1080: Changed Token.DEFAULT_TYPE to be public.

10. LUCENE-1064: Changed TopDocs constructor to be public. 
     (Shai Erera via Michael Busch)

11. LUCENE-1079: DocValues cleanup: constructor now has no params,
    and getInnerArray() now throws UnsupportedOperationException (Doron Cohen)

12. LUCENE-1089: Added PriorityQueue.insertWithOverflow, which returns
    the Object (if any) that was bumped from the queue to allow
    re-use.  (Shai Erera via Mike McCandless)
    
13. LUCENE-1101: Token reuse 'contract' (defined LUCENE-969)
    modified so it is token producer's responsibility
    to call Token.clear(). (Doron Cohen)   

14. LUCENE-1118: Changed StandardAnalyzer to skip too-long (default >
    255 characters) tokens.  You can increase this limit by calling
    StandardAnalyzer.setMaxTokenLength(...).  (Michael McCandless)


Bug fixes

 1. LUCENE-933: QueryParser fixed to not produce empty sub 
    BooleanQueries "()" even if the Analyzer produced no 
    tokens for input. (Doron Cohen)

 2. LUCENE-955: Fixed SegmentTermPositions to work correctly with the
    first term in the dictionary. (Michael Busch)

 3. LUCENE-951: Fixed NullPointerException in MultiLevelSkipListReader
    that was thrown after a call of TermPositions.seek(). 
    (Rich Johnson via Michael Busch)
    
 4. LUCENE-938: Fixed cases where an unhandled exception in
    IndexWriter's methods could cause deletes to be lost.
    (Steven Parkes via Mike McCandless)
      
 5. LUCENE-962: Fixed case where an unhandled exception in
    IndexWriter.addDocument or IndexWriter.updateDocument could cause
    unreferenced files in the index to not be deleted
    (Steven Parkes via Mike McCandless)
  
 6. LUCENE-957: RAMDirectory fixed to properly handle directories
    larger than Integer.MAX_VALUE. (Doron Cohen)

 7. LUCENE-781: MultiReader fixed to not throw NPE if isCurrent(),
    isOptimized() or getVersion() is called. Separated MultiReader
    into two classes: MultiSegmentReader extends IndexReader, is
    package-protected and is created automatically by IndexReader.open()
    in case the index has multiple segments. The public MultiReader 
    now extends MultiSegmentReader and is intended to be used by users
    who want to add their own subreaders. (Daniel Naber, Michael Busch)

 8. LUCENE-970: FilterIndexReader now implements isOptimized(). Before
    a call of isOptimized() would throw a NPE. (Michael Busch)

 9. LUCENE-832: ParallelReader fixed to not throw NPE if isCurrent(),
    isOptimized() or getVersion() is called. (Michael Busch)
      
10. LUCENE-948: Fix FNFE exception caused by stale NFS client
    directory listing caches when writers on different machines are
    sharing an index over NFS and using a custom deletion policy (Mike
    McCandless)

11. LUCENE-978: Ensure TermInfosReader, FieldsReader, and FieldsReader
    close any streams they had opened if an exception is hit in the
    constructor.  (Ning Li via Mike McCandless)

12. LUCENE-985: If an extremely long term is in a doc (> 16383 chars),
    we now throw an IllegalArgumentException saying the term is too
    long, instead of cryptic ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException.  (Karl
    Wettin via Mike McCandless)

13. LUCENE-991: The explain() method of BoostingTermQuery had errors
    when no payloads were present on a document.  (Peter Keegan via
    Grant Ingersoll)

14. LUCENE-992: Fixed IndexWriter.updateDocument to be atomic again
    (this was broken by LUCENE-843).  (Ning Li via Mike McCandless)

15. LUCENE-1008: Fixed corruption case when document with no term
    vector fields is added after documents with term vector fields.
    This bug was introduced with LUCENE-843.  (Grant Ingersoll via
    Mike McCandless)

16. LUCENE-1006: Fixed QueryParser to accept a "" field value (zero
    length quoted string.)  (yonik)

17. LUCENE-1010: Fixed corruption case when document with no term
    vector fields is added after documents with term vector fields.
    This case is hit during merge and would cause an EOFException.
    This bug was introduced with LUCENE-984.  (Andi Vajda via Mike
    McCandless)

19. LUCENE-1009: Fix merge slowdown with LogByteSizeMergePolicy when
    autoCommit=false and documents are using stored fields and/or term
    vectors.  (Mark Miller via Mike McCandless)

20. LUCENE-1011: Fixed corruption case when two or more machines,
    sharing an index over NFS, can be writers in quick succession.
    (Patrick Kimber via Mike McCandless)

21. LUCENE-1028: Fixed Weight serialization for few queries:
    DisjunctionMaxQuery, ValueSourceQuery, CustomScoreQuery.
    Serialization check added for all queries.
    (Kyle Maxwell via Doron Cohen)

22. LUCENE-1048: Fixed incorrect behavior in Lock.obtain(...) when the
    timeout argument is very large (eg Long.MAX_VALUE).  Also added
    Lock.LOCK_OBTAIN_WAIT_FOREVER constant to never timeout.  (Nikolay
    Diakov via Mike McCandless)

23. LUCENE-1050: Throw LockReleaseFailedException in
    Simple/NativeFSLockFactory if we fail to delete the lock file when
    releasing the lock.  (Nikolay Diakov via Mike McCandless)

24. LUCENE-1071: Fixed SegmentMerger to correctly set payload bit in 
    the merged segment. (Michael Busch)

25. LUCENE-1042: Remove throwing of IOException in getTermFreqVector(int, String, TermVectorMapper) to be consistent
    with other getTermFreqVector calls.  Also removed the throwing of the other IOException in that method to be consistent.  (Karl Wettin via Grant Ingersoll)
    
26. LUCENE-1096: Fixed Hits behavior when hits' docs are deleted 
    along with iterating the hits. Deleting docs already retrieved 
    now works seamlessly. If docs not yet retrieved are deleted 
    (e.g. from another thread), and then, relying on the initial 
    Hits.length(), an application attempts to retrieve more hits 
    than actually exist , a ConcurrentMidificationException 
    is thrown.  (Doron Cohen)

27. LUCENE-1068: Changed StandardTokenizer to fix an issue with it marking
  the type of some tokens incorrectly.  This is done by adding a new flag named
  replaceInvalidAcronym which defaults to false, the current, incorrect behavior.  Setting
  this flag to true fixes the problem.  This flag is a temporary fix and is already
  marked as being deprecated.  3.x will implement the correct approach.  (Shai Erera via Grant Ingersoll)
  LUCENE-1140: Fixed NPE caused by 1068 (Alexei Dets via Grant Ingersoll)
    
28. LUCENE-749: ChainedFilter behavior fixed when logic of 
    first filter is ANDNOT.  (Antonio Bruno via Doron Cohen)

29. LUCENE-508: Make sure SegmentTermEnum.prev() is accurate (= last
    term) after next() returns false.  (Steven Tamm via Mike
    McCandless)

    
New features

 1. LUCENE-906: Elision filter for French.
    (Mathieu Lecarme via Otis Gospodnetic)

 2. LUCENE-960: Added a SpanQueryFilter and related classes to allow for
    not only filtering, but knowing where in a Document a Filter matches
    (Grant Ingersoll)

 3. LUCENE-868: Added new Term Vector access features.  New callback
    mechanism allows application to define how and where to read Term
    Vectors from disk. This implementation contains several extensions
    of the new abstract TermVectorMapper class.  The new API should be
    back-compatible.  No changes in the actual storage of Term Vectors
    has taken place.
 3.1 LUCENE-1038: Added setDocumentNumber() method to TermVectorMapper
     to provide information about what document is being accessed.
     (Karl Wettin via Grant Ingersoll)

 4. LUCENE-975: Added PositionBasedTermVectorMapper that allows for
    position based lookup of term vector information.
    See item #3 above (LUCENE-868).

 5. LUCENE-1011: Added simple tools (all in org.apache.lucene.store)
    to verify that locking is working properly.  LockVerifyServer runs
    a separate server to verify locks.  LockStressTest runs a simple
    tool that rapidly obtains and releases locks.
    VerifyingLockFactory is a LockFactory that wraps any other
    LockFactory and consults the LockVerifyServer whenever a lock is
    obtained or released, throwing an exception if an illegal lock
    obtain occurred.  (Patrick Kimber via Mike McCandless)

 6. LUCENE-1015: Added FieldCache extension (ExtendedFieldCache) to
    support doubles and longs.  Added support into SortField for sorting
    on doubles and longs as well.  (Grant Ingersoll)

 7. LUCENE-1020: Created basic index checking & repair tool
    (o.a.l.index.CheckIndex).  When run without -fix it does a
    detailed test of all segments in the index and reports summary
    information and any errors it hit.  With -fix it will remove
    segments that had errors.  (Mike McCandless)

 8. LUCENE-743: Add IndexReader.reopen() method that re-opens an
    existing IndexReader by only loading those portions of an index
    that have changed since the reader was (re)opened. reopen() can
    be significantly faster than open(), depending on the amount of
    index changes. SegmentReader, MultiSegmentReader, MultiReader,
    and ParallelReader implement reopen(). (Michael Busch) 

 9. LUCENE-1040: CharArraySet useful for efficiently checking
    set membership of text specified by char[]. (yonik)

10. LUCENE-1073: Created SnapshotDeletionPolicy to facilitate taking a
    live backup of an index without pausing indexing.  (Mike
    McCandless)
    
11. LUCENE-1019: CustomScoreQuery enhanced to support multiple 
    ValueSource queries. (Kyle Maxwell via Doron Cohen)
    
12. LUCENE-1095: Added an option to StopFilter to increase 
    positionIncrement of the token succeeding a stopped token.
    Disabled by default. Similar option added to QueryParser 
    to consider token positions when creating PhraseQuery 
    and MultiPhraseQuery. Disabled by default (so by default
    the query parser ignores position increments).
    (Doron Cohen)

13. LUCENE-1380: Added TokenFilter for setting position increment in special cases related to the ShingleFilter (Mck SembWever, Steve Rowe, Karl Wettin via Grant Ingersoll)



Optimizations

 1. LUCENE-937: CachingTokenFilter now uses an iterator to access the 
    Tokens that are cached in the LinkedList. This increases performance 
    significantly, especially when the number of Tokens is large. 
    (Mark Miller via Michael Busch)

 2. LUCENE-843: Substantial optimizations to improve how IndexWriter
    uses RAM for buffering documents and to speed up indexing (2X-8X
    faster).  A single shared hash table now records the in-memory
    postings per unique term and is directly flushed into a single
    segment.  (Mike McCandless)
 
 3. LUCENE-892: Fixed extra "buffer to buffer copy" that sometimes
    takes place when using compound files.  (Mike McCandless)

 4. LUCENE-959: Remove synchronization in Document (yonik)

 5. LUCENE-963: Add setters to Field to allow for re-using a single
    Field instance during indexing.  This is a sizable performance
    gain, especially for small documents.  (Mike McCandless)

 6. LUCENE-939: Check explicitly for boundary conditions in FieldInfos
    and don't rely on exceptions. (Michael Busch)

 7. LUCENE-966: Very substantial speedups (~6X faster) for
    StandardTokenizer (StandardAnalyzer) by using JFlex instead of
    JavaCC to generate the tokenizer.
    (Stanislaw Osinski via Mike McCandless)

 8. LUCENE-969: Changed core tokenizers & filters to re-use Token and
    TokenStream instances when possible to improve tokenization
    performance (~10-15%). (Mike McCandless)

 9. LUCENE-871: Speedup ISOLatin1AccentFilter (Ian Boston via Mike
    McCandless)

10. LUCENE-986: Refactored SegmentInfos from IndexReader into the new
    subclass DirectoryIndexReader. SegmentReader and MultiSegmentReader
    now extend DirectoryIndexReader and are the only IndexReader 
    implementations that use SegmentInfos to access an index and 
    acquire a write lock for index modifications. (Michael Busch)

11. LUCENE-1007: Allow flushing in IndexWriter to be triggered by
    either RAM usage or document count or both (whichever comes
    first), by adding symbolic constant DISABLE_AUTO_FLUSH to disable
    one of the flush triggers.  (Ning Li via Mike McCandless)

12. LUCENE-1043: Speed up merging of stored fields by bulk-copying the
    raw bytes for each contiguous range of non-deleted documents.
    (Robert Engels via Mike McCandless)

13. LUCENE-693: Speed up nested conjunctions (~2x) that match many
    documents, and a slight performance increase for top level
    conjunctions.  (yonik)

14. LUCENE-1098: Make inner class StandardAnalyzer.SavedStreams static 
    and final. (Nathan Beyer via Michael Busch)

Documentation

 1. LUCENE-1051: Generate separate javadocs for core, demo and contrib
    classes, as well as an unified view. Also add an appropriate menu 
    structure to the website. (Michael Busch)

 2. LUCENE-746: Fix error message in AnalyzingQueryParser.getPrefixQuery.
    (Ronnie Kolehmainen via Michael Busch)

Build

 1. LUCENE-908: Improvements and simplifications for how the MANIFEST
    file and the META-INF dir are created. (Michael Busch)

 2. LUCENE-935: Various improvements for the maven artifacts. Now the
    artifacts also include the sources as .jar files. (Michael Busch)

 3. Added apply-patch target to top-level build.  Defaults to looking for
    a patch in ${basedir}/../patches with name specified by -Dpatch.name.
    Can also specify any location by -Dpatch.file property on the command
    line.  This should be helpful for easy application of patches, but it
    is also a step towards integrating automatic patch application with
    JIRA and Hudson, and is thus subject to change.  (Grant Ingersoll)
 
 4. LUCENE-935: Defined property "m2.repository.url" to allow setting
    the url to a maven remote repository to deploy to. (Michael Busch)

 5. LUCENE-1051: Include javadocs in the maven artifacts. (Michael Busch)

 6. LUCENE-1055: Remove gdata-server from build files and its sources 
    from trunk. (Michael Busch)

 7. LUCENE-935: Allow to deploy maven artifacts to a remote m2 repository
    via scp and ssh authentication. (Michael Busch)
	
 8. LUCENE-1123: Allow overriding the specification version for 
    MANIFEST.MF (Michael Busch)

Test Cases

 1. LUCENE-766: Test adding two fields with the same name but different 
    term vector setting.  (Nicolas Lalevée via Doron Cohen)  
    
======================= Release 2.2.0 =======================

Changes in runtime behavior

API Changes

 1. LUCENE-793: created new exceptions and added them to throws clause
    for many methods (all subclasses of IOException for backwards
    compatibility): index.StaleReaderException,
    index.CorruptIndexException, store.LockObtainFailedException.
    This was done to better call out the possible root causes of an
    IOException from these methods.  (Mike McCandless)

 2. LUCENE-811: make SegmentInfos class, plus a few methods from related
    classes, package-private again (they were unnecessarily made public
    as part of LUCENE-701).  (Mike McCandless)

 3. LUCENE-710: added optional autoCommit boolean to IndexWriter
    constructors.  When this is false, index changes are not committed
    until the writer is closed.  This gives explicit control over when
    a reader will see the changes.  Also added optional custom
    deletion policy to explicitly control when prior commits are
    removed from the index.  This is intended to allow applications to
    share an index over NFS by customizing when prior commits are
    deleted. (Mike McCandless)

 4. LUCENE-818: changed most public methods of IndexWriter,
    IndexReader (and its subclasses), FieldsReader and RAMDirectory to
    throw AlreadyClosedException if they are accessed after being
    closed.  (Mike McCandless)

 5. LUCENE-834: Changed some access levels for certain Span classes to allow them
    to be overridden.  They have been marked expert only and not for public
    consumption. (Grant Ingersoll) 

 6. LUCENE-796: Removed calls to super.* from various get*Query methods in
    MultiFieldQueryParser, in order to allow sub-classes to override them.
    (Steven Parkes via Otis Gospodnetic)

 7. LUCENE-857: Removed caching from QueryFilter and deprecated QueryFilter
    in favour of QueryWrapperFilter or QueryWrapperFilter + CachingWrapperFilter
    combination when caching is desired.
    (Chris Hostetter, Otis Gospodnetic)

 8. LUCENE-869: Changed FSIndexInput and FSIndexOutput to inner classes of FSDirectory
    to enable extensibility of these classes. (Michael Busch)

 9. LUCENE-580: Added the public method reset() to TokenStream. This method does
    nothing by default, but may be overwritten by subclasses to support consuming
    the TokenStream more than once. (Michael Busch)

10. LUCENE-580: Added a new constructor to Field that takes a TokenStream as
    argument, available as tokenStreamValue(). This is useful to avoid the need of 
    "dummy analyzers" for pre-analyzed fields. (Karl Wettin, Michael Busch)

11. LUCENE-730: Added the new methods to BooleanQuery setAllowDocsOutOfOrder() and
    getAllowDocsOutOfOrder(). Deprecated the methods setUseScorer14() and 
    getUseScorer14(). The optimization patch LUCENE-730 (see Optimizations->3.) 
    improves performance for certain queries but results in scoring out of docid 
    order. This patch reverse this change, so now by default hit docs are scored
    in docid order if not setAllowDocsOutOfOrder(true) is explicitly called.
    This patch also enables the tests in QueryUtils again that check for docid
    order. (Paul Elschot, Doron Cohen, Michael Busch)

12. LUCENE-888: Added Directory.openInput(File path, int bufferSize)
    to optionally specify the size of the read buffer.  Also added
    BufferedIndexInput.setBufferSize(int) to change the buffer size.
    (Mike McCandless)

13. LUCENE-923: Make SegmentTermPositionVector package-private. It does not need
    to be public because it implements the public interface TermPositionVector.
    (Michael Busch)

Bug fixes

 1. LUCENE-804: Fixed build.xml to pack a fully compilable src dist.  (Doron Cohen)

 2. LUCENE-813: Leading wildcard fixed to work with trailing wildcard.
    Query parser modified to create a prefix query only for the case 
    that there is a single trailing wildcard (and no additional wildcard 
    or '?' in the query text).  (Doron Cohen)

 3. LUCENE-812: Add no-argument constructors to NativeFSLockFactory
    and SimpleFSLockFactory.  This enables all 4 builtin LockFactory
    implementations to be specified via the System property
    org.apache.lucene.store.FSDirectoryLockFactoryClass.  (Mike McCandless)

 4. LUCENE-821: The new single-norm-file introduced by LUCENE-756
    failed to reduce the number of open descriptors since it was still
    opened once per field with norms. (yonik)

 5. LUCENE-823: Make sure internal file handles are closed when
    hitting an exception (eg disk full) while flushing deletes in
    IndexWriter's mergeSegments, and also during
    IndexWriter.addIndexes.  (Mike McCandless)

 6. LUCENE-825: If directory is removed after
    FSDirectory.getDirectory() but before IndexReader.open you now get
    a FileNotFoundException like Lucene pre-2.1 (before this fix you
    got an NPE).  (Mike McCandless)

 7. LUCENE-800: Removed backslash from the TERM_CHAR list in the queryparser, 
    because the backslash is the escape character. Also changed the ESCAPED_CHAR
    list to contain all possible characters, because every character that 
    follows a backslash should be considered as escaped. (Michael Busch)

 8. LUCENE-372: QueryParser.parse() now ensures that the entire input string 
    is consumed. Now a ParseException is thrown if a query contains too many
    closing parentheses. (Andreas Neumann via Michael Busch)

 9. LUCENE-814: javacc build targets now fix line-end-style of generated files.
    Now also deleting all javacc generated files before calling javacc.
    (Steven Parkes, Doron Cohen)
    
10. LUCENE-829: close readers in contrib/benchmark. (Karl Wettin, Doron Cohen)

11. LUCENE-828: Minor fix for Term's equal().
    (Paul Cowan via Otis Gospodnetic)

12. LUCENE-846: Fixed: if IndexWriter is opened with autoCommit=false,
    and you call addIndexes, and hit an exception (eg disk full) then
    when IndexWriter rolls back its internal state this could corrupt
    the instance of IndexWriter (but, not the index itself) by
    referencing already deleted segments.  This bug was only present
    in 2.2 (trunk), ie was never released.  (Mike McCandless)
    
13. LUCENE-736: Sloppy phrase query with repeating terms matches wrong docs.
    For example query "B C B"~2 matches the doc "A B C D E". (Doron Cohen)
    
14. LUCENE-789: Fixed: custom similarity is ignored when using MultiSearcher (problem reported 
    by Alexey Lef). Now the similarity applied by MultiSearcer.setSimilarity(sim) is being used. 
    Note that as before this fix, creating a multiSearcher from Searchers for whom custom similarity 
    was set has no effect - it is masked by the similarity of the MultiSearcher. This is as 
    designed, because MultiSearcher operates on Searchables (not Searchers). (Doron Cohen)

15. LUCENE-880: Fixed DocumentWriter to close the TokenStreams after it
    has written the postings. Then the resources associated with the 
    TokenStreams can safely be released. (Michael Busch)

16. LUCENE-883: consecutive calls to Spellchecker.indexDictionary()
    won't insert terms twice anymore. (Daniel Naber)

17. LUCENE-881: QueryParser.escape() now also escapes the characters
    '|' and '&' which are part of the queryparser syntax. (Michael Busch)

18. LUCENE-886: Spellchecker clean up: exceptions aren't printed to STDERR
    anymore and ignored, but re-thrown. Some javadoc improvements.
    (Daniel Naber)

19. LUCENE-698: FilteredQuery now takes the query boost into account for 
    scoring. (Michael Busch)

20. LUCENE-763: Spellchecker: LuceneDictionary used to skip first word in 
    enumeration. (Christian Mallwitz via Daniel Naber)
    
21. LUCENE-903: FilteredQuery explanation inaccuracy with boost.
    Explanation tests now "deep" check the explanation details.
    (Chris Hostetter, Doron Cohen)
    
22. LUCENE-912: DisjunctionMaxScorer first skipTo(target) call ignores the 
    skip target param and ends up at the first match.
    (Sudaakeran B. via Chris Hostetter & Doron Cohen)
    
23. LUCENE-913: Two consecutive score() calls return different 
    scores for Boolean Queries. (Michael Busch, Doron Cohen)

24. LUCENE-1013: Fix IndexWriter.setMaxMergeDocs to work "out of the
    box", again, by moving set/getMaxMergeDocs up from
    LogDocMergePolicy into LogMergePolicy.  This fixes the API
    breakage (non backwards compatible change) caused by LUCENE-994.
    (Yonik Seeley via Mike McCandless)

New features

 1. LUCENE-759: Added two n-gram-producing TokenFilters.
    (Otis Gospodnetic)

 2. LUCENE-822: Added FieldSelector capabilities to Searchable for use with
    RemoteSearcher, and other Searchable implementations. (Mark Miller, Grant Ingersoll)

 3. LUCENE-755: Added the ability to store arbitrary binary metadata in the posting list.
    These metadata are called Payloads. For every position of a Token one Payload in the form
    of a variable length byte array can be stored in the prox file.
    Remark: The APIs introduced with this feature are in experimental state and thus
            contain appropriate warnings in the javadocs.
    (Michael Busch)

 4. LUCENE-834: Added BoostingTermQuery which can boost scores based on the
    values of a payload (see #3 above.) (Grant Ingersoll)

 5. LUCENE-834: Similarity has a new method for scoring payloads called
    scorePayloads that can be overridden to take advantage of payload
    storage (see #3 above)

 6. LUCENE-834: Added isPayloadAvailable() onto TermPositions interface and
    implemented it in the appropriate places (Grant Ingersoll)

 7. LUCENE-853: Added RemoteCachingWrapperFilter to enable caching of Filters
    on the remote side of the RMI connection.
    (Matt Ericson via Otis Gospodnetic)

 8. LUCENE-446: Added Solr's search.function for scores based on field 
    values, plus CustomScoreQuery for simple score (post) customization.
    (Yonik Seeley, Doron Cohen)

 9. LUCENE-1058: Added new TeeTokenFilter (like the UNIX 'tee' command) and SinkTokenizer which can be used to share tokens between two or more
    Fields such that the other Fields do not have to go through the whole Analysis process over again.  For instance, if you have two
    Fields that share all the same analysis steps except one lowercases tokens and the other does not, you can coordinate the operations
    between the two using the TeeTokenFilter and the SinkTokenizer.  See TeeSinkTokenTest.java for examples.
    (Grant Ingersoll, Michael Busch, Yonik Seeley)
 
Optimizations

 1. LUCENE-761: The proxStream is now cloned lazily in SegmentTermPositions
    when nextPosition() is called for the first time. This allows using instances
    of SegmentTermPositions instead of SegmentTermDocs without additional costs.
    (Michael Busch)

 2. LUCENE-431: RAMInputStream and RAMOutputStream extend IndexInput and
    IndexOutput directly now. This avoids further buffering and thus avoids 
    unnecessary array copies. (Michael Busch)

 3. LUCENE-730: Updated BooleanScorer2 to make use of BooleanScorer in some
    cases and possibly improve scoring performance.  Documents can now be
    delivered out-of-order as they are scored (e.g. to HitCollector).
    N.B. A bit of code had to be disabled in QueryUtils in order for
    TestBoolean2 test to keep passing.
    (Paul Elschot via Otis Gospodnetic)

 4. LUCENE-882: Spellchecker doesn't store the ngrams anymore but only indexes
    them to keep the spell index small. (Daniel Naber)

 5. LUCENE-430: Delay allocation of the buffer after a clone of BufferedIndexInput.
    Together with LUCENE-888 this will allow to adjust the buffer size
    dynamically. (Paul Elschot, Michael Busch)
 
 6. LUCENE-888: Increase buffer sizes inside CompoundFileWriter and
    BufferedIndexOutput.  Also increase buffer size in
    BufferedIndexInput, but only when used during merging.  Together,
    these increases yield 10-18% overall performance gain vs the
    previous 1K defaults.  (Mike McCandless)

 7. LUCENE-866: Adds multi-level skip lists to the posting lists. This speeds 
    up most queries that use skipTo(), especially on big indexes with large posting 
    lists. For average AND queries the speedup is about 20%, for queries that 
    contain very frequent and very unique terms the speedup can be over 80%.
    (Michael Busch)

Documentation

 1. LUCENE 791 && INFRA-1173: Infrastructure moved the Wiki to
    http://wiki.apache.org/lucene-java/   Updated the links in the docs and
    wherever else I found references.  (Grant Ingersoll, Joe Schaefer)

 2. LUCENE-807: Fixed the javadoc for ScoreDocComparator.compare() to be 
    consistent with java.util.Comparator.compare(): Any integer is allowed to 
    be returned instead of only -1/0/1.
    (Paul Cowan via Michael Busch)
 
 3. LUCENE-875: Solved javadoc warnings & errors under jdk1.4. 
    Solved javadoc errors under jdk5 (jars in path for gdata).
    Made "javadocs" target depend on "build-contrib" for first downloading
    contrib jars configured for dynamic downloaded. (Note: when running
    behind firewall, a firewall prompt might pop up) (Doron Cohen)

 4. LUCENE-740: Added SNOWBALL-LICENSE.txt to the snowball package and a
    remark about the license to NOTICE.TXT. (Steven Parkes via Michael Busch)

 5. LUCENE-925: Added analysis package javadocs. (Grant Ingersoll and Doron Cohen)

 6. LUCENE-926: Added document package javadocs. (Grant Ingersoll)

Build

 1. LUCENE-802: Added LICENSE.TXT and NOTICE.TXT to Lucene jars.
    (Steven Parkes via Michael Busch)

 2. LUCENE-885: "ant test" now includes all contrib tests.  The new
    "ant test-core" target can be used to run only the Core (non
    contrib) tests. 
    (Chris Hostetter)
    
 3. LUCENE-900: "ant test" now enables Java assertions (in Lucene packages).
    (Doron Cohen)

 4. LUCENE-894: Add custom build file for binary distributions that includes
    targets to build the demos. (Chris Hostetter, Michael Busch)

 5. LUCENE-904: The "package" targets in build.xml now also generate .md5
    checksum files. (Chris Hostetter, Michael Busch)

 6. LUCENE-907: Include LICENSE.TXT and NOTICE.TXT in the META-INF dirs of
    demo war, demo jar, and the contrib jars. (Michael Busch)
    
 7. LUCENE-909: Demo targets for running the demo. (Doron Cohen)

 8. LUCENE-908: Improves content of MANIFEST file and makes it customizable
    for the contribs. Adds SNOWBALL-LICENSE.txt to META-INF of the snowball
    jar and makes sure that the lucli jar contains LICENSE.txt and NOTICE.txt.
    (Chris Hostetter, Michael Busch)

 9. LUCENE-930: Various contrib building improvements to ensure contrib
    dependencies are met, and test compilation errors fail the build.
    (Steven Parkes, Chris Hostetter)

10. LUCENE-622: Add ant target and pom.xml files for building maven artifacts 
    of the Lucene core and the contrib modules. 
    (Sami Siren, Karl Wettin, Michael Busch)

======================= Release 2.1.0 =======================

Changes in runtime behavior

 1. 's' and 't' have been removed from the list of default stopwords
    in StopAnalyzer (also used in by StandardAnalyzer). Having e.g. 's'
    as a stopword meant that 's-class' led to the same results as 'class'.
    Note that this problem still exists for 'a', e.g. in 'a-class' as
    'a' continues to be a stopword.
    (Daniel Naber)

 2. LUCENE-478: Updated the list of Unicode code point ranges for CJK
    (now split into CJ and K) in StandardAnalyzer.  (John Wang and
    Steven Rowe via Otis Gospodnetic)

 3. Modified some CJK Unicode code point ranges in StandardTokenizer.jj,
    and added a few more of them to increase CJK character coverage.
    Also documented some of the ranges.
    (Otis Gospodnetic)

 4. LUCENE-489: Add support for leading wildcard characters (*, ?) to
    QueryParser.  Default is to disallow them, as before.
    (Steven Parkes via Otis Gospodnetic)

 5. LUCENE-703: QueryParser changed to default to use of ConstantScoreRangeQuery
    for range queries. Added useOldRangeQuery property to QueryParser to allow
    selection of old RangeQuery class if required.
    (Mark Harwood)

 6. LUCENE-543: WildcardQuery now performs a TermQuery if the provided term
    does not contain a wildcard character (? or *), when previously a
    StringIndexOutOfBoundsException was thrown.
    (Michael Busch via Erik Hatcher)

 7. LUCENE-726: Removed the use of deprecated doc.fields() method and
    Enumeration.
    (Michael Busch via Otis Gospodnetic)

 8. LUCENE-436: Removed finalize() in TermInfosReader and SegmentReader,
    and added a call to enumerators.remove() in TermInfosReader.close().
    The finalize() overrides were added to help with a pre-1.4.2 JVM bug
    that has since been fixed, plus we no longer support pre-1.4.2 JVMs.
    (Otis Gospodnetic)

 9. LUCENE-771: The default location of the write lock is now the
    index directory, and is named simply "write.lock" (without a big
    digest prefix).  The system properties "org.apache.lucene.lockDir"
    nor "java.io.tmpdir" are no longer used as the global directory
    for storing lock files, and the LOCK_DIR field of FSDirectory is
    now deprecated.  (Mike McCandless)

New features

 1. LUCENE-503: New ThaiAnalyzer and ThaiWordFilter in contrib/analyzers
    (Samphan Raruenrom via Chris Hostetter)

 2. LUCENE-545: New FieldSelector API and associated changes to
    IndexReader and implementations.  New Fieldable interface for use
    with the lazy field loading mechanism.  (Grant Ingersoll and Chuck
    Williams via Grant Ingersoll)

 3. LUCENE-676: Move Solr's PrefixFilter to Lucene core. (Yura
    Smolsky, Yonik Seeley)

 4. LUCENE-678: Added NativeFSLockFactory, which implements locking
    using OS native locking (via java.nio.*).  (Michael McCandless via
    Yonik Seeley)

 5. LUCENE-544: Added the ability to specify different boosts for
    different fields when using MultiFieldQueryParser (Matt Ericson
    via Otis Gospodnetic)

 6. LUCENE-528: New IndexWriter.addIndexesNoOptimize() that doesn't
    optimize the index when adding new segments, only performing
    merges as needed.  (Ning Li via Yonik Seeley)

 7. LUCENE-573: QueryParser now allows backslash escaping in
    quoted terms and phrases. (Michael Busch via Yonik Seeley)

 8. LUCENE-716: QueryParser now allows specification of Unicode
    characters in terms via a unicode escape of the form \uXXXX
    (Michael Busch via Yonik Seeley)

 9. LUCENE-709: Added RAMDirectory.sizeInBytes(), IndexWriter.ramSizeInBytes()
    and IndexWriter.flushRamSegments(), allowing applications to
    control the amount of memory used to buffer documents.
    (Chuck Williams via Yonik Seeley)

10. LUCENE-723: QueryParser now parses *:* as MatchAllDocsQuery
    (Yonik Seeley)

11. LUCENE-741: Command-line utility for modifying or removing norms
    on fields in an existing index.  This is mostly based on LUCENE-496
    and lives in contrib/miscellaneous.
    (Chris Hostetter, Otis Gospodnetic)

12. LUCENE-759: Added NGramTokenizer and EdgeNGramTokenizer classes and
    their passing unit tests.
    (Otis Gospodnetic)

13. LUCENE-565: Added methods to IndexWriter to more efficiently
    handle updating documents (the "delete then add" use case).  This
    is intended to be an eventual replacement for the existing
    IndexModifier.  Added IndexWriter.flush() (renamed from
    flushRamSegments()) to flush all pending updates (held in RAM), to
    the Directory.  (Ning Li via Mike McCandless)

14. LUCENE-762: Added in SIZE and SIZE_AND_BREAK FieldSelectorResult options
    which allow one to retrieve the size of a field without retrieving the
    actual field. (Chuck Williams via Grant Ingersoll)

15. LUCENE-799: Properly handle lazy, compressed fields.
    (Mike Klaas via Grant Ingersoll)

API Changes

 1. LUCENE-438: Remove "final" from Token, implement Cloneable, allow
    changing of termText via setTermText().  (Yonik Seeley)

 2. org.apache.lucene.analysis.nl.WordlistLoader has been deprecated
    and is supposed to be replaced with the WordlistLoader class in
    package org.apache.lucene.analysis (Daniel Naber)

 3. LUCENE-609: Revert return type of Document.getField(s) to Field
    for backward compatibility, added new Document.getFieldable(s)
    for access to new lazy loaded fields. (Yonik Seeley)

 4. LUCENE-608: Document.fields() has been deprecated and a new method
    Document.getFields() has been added that returns a List instead of
    an Enumeration (Daniel Naber)

 5. LUCENE-605: New Explanation.isMatch() method and new ComplexExplanation
    subclass allows explain methods to produce Explanations which model
    "matching" independent of having a positive value.
    (Chris Hostetter)

 6. LUCENE-621: New static methods IndexWriter.setDefaultWriteLockTimeout
    and IndexWriter.setDefaultCommitLockTimeout for overriding default
    timeout values for all future instances of IndexWriter (as well
    as for any other classes that may reference the static values,
    ie: IndexReader).
    (Michael McCandless via Chris Hostetter)

 7. LUCENE-638: FSDirectory.list() now only returns the directory's
    Lucene-related files. Thanks to this change one can now construct
    a RAMDirectory from a file system directory that contains files
    not related to Lucene.
    (Simon Willnauer via Daniel Naber)

 8. LUCENE-635: Decoupling locking implementation from Directory
    implementation.  Added set/getLockFactory to Directory and moved
    all locking code into subclasses of abstract class LockFactory.
    FSDirectory and RAMDirectory still default to their prior locking
    implementations, but now you can mix & match, for example using
    SingleInstanceLockFactory (ie, in memory locking) locking with an
    FSDirectory.  Note that now you must call setDisableLocks before
    the instantiation a FSDirectory if you wish to disable locking
    for that Directory.
    (Michael McCandless, Jeff Patterson via Yonik Seeley)

 9. LUCENE-657: Made FuzzyQuery non-final and inner ScoreTerm protected.
    (Steven Parkes via Otis Gospodnetic)

10. LUCENE-701: Lockless commits: a commit lock is no longer required
    when a writer commits and a reader opens the index.  This includes
    a change to the index file format (see docs/fileformats.html for
    details).  It also removes all APIs associated with the commit
    lock & its timeout.  Readers are now truly read-only and do not
    block one another on startup.  This is the first step to getting
    Lucene to work correctly over NFS (second step is
    LUCENE-710). (Mike McCandless)

11. LUCENE-722: DEFAULT_MIN_DOC_FREQ was misspelled DEFALT_MIN_DOC_FREQ
    in Similarity's MoreLikeThis class. The misspelling has been
    replaced by the correct spelling.
    (Andi Vajda via Daniel Naber)

12. LUCENE-738: Reduce the size of the file that keeps track of which
    documents are deleted when the number of deleted documents is
    small.  This changes the index file format and cannot be
    read by previous versions of Lucene.  (Doron Cohen via Yonik Seeley)

13. LUCENE-756: Maintain all norms in a single .nrm file to reduce the
    number of open files and file descriptors for the non-compound index
    format.  This changes the index file format, but maintains the
    ability to read and update older indices. The first segment merge
    on an older format index will create a single .nrm file for the new
    segment.  (Doron Cohen via Yonik Seeley)

14. LUCENE-732: DateTools support has been added to QueryParser, with
    setters for both the default Resolution, and per-field Resolution.
    For backwards compatibility, DateField is still used if no Resolutions
    are specified. (Michael Busch via Chris Hostetter)

15. Added isOptimized() method to IndexReader.
    (Otis Gospodnetic)

16. LUCENE-773: Deprecate the FSDirectory.getDirectory(*) methods that
    take a boolean "create" argument.  Instead you should use
    IndexWriter's "create" argument to create a new index.
    (Mike McCandless)

17. LUCENE-780: Add a static Directory.copy() method to copy files
    from one Directory to another.  (Jiri Kuhn via Mike McCandless)

18. LUCENE-773: Added Directory.clearLock(String name) to forcefully
    remove an old lock.  The default implementation is to ask the
    lockFactory (if non null) to clear the lock.  (Mike McCandless)

19. LUCENE-795: Directory.renameFile() has been deprecated as it is
    not used anymore inside Lucene.  (Daniel Naber)

Bug fixes

 1. Fixed the web application demo (built with "ant war-demo") which
    didn't work because it used a QueryParser method that had
    been removed (Daniel Naber)

 2. LUCENE-583: ISOLatin1AccentFilter fails to preserve positionIncrement
    (Yonik Seeley)

 3. LUCENE-575: SpellChecker min score is incorrectly changed by suggestSimilar
    (Karl Wettin via Yonik Seeley)

 4. LUCENE-587: Explanation.toHtml was producing malformed HTML
    (Chris Hostetter)

 5. Fix to allow MatchAllDocsQuery to be used with RemoteSearcher (Yonik Seeley)

 6. LUCENE-601: RAMDirectory and RAMFile made Serializable
    (Karl Wettin via Otis Gospodnetic)

 7. LUCENE-557: Fixes to BooleanQuery and FilteredQuery so that the score
    Explanations match up with the real scores.
    (Chris Hostetter)

 8. LUCENE-607: ParallelReader's TermEnum fails to advance properly to
    new fields (Chuck Williams, Christian Kohlschuetter via Yonik Seeley)

 9. LUCENE-610,LUCENE-611: Simple syntax changes to allow compilation with ecj:
    disambiguate inner class scorer's use of doc() in BooleanScorer2,
    other test code changes.  (DM Smith via Yonik Seeley)

10. LUCENE-451: All core query types now use ComplexExplanations so that
    boosts of zero don't confuse the BooleanWeight explain method.
    (Chris Hostetter)

11. LUCENE-593: Fixed LuceneDictionary's inner Iterator
    (Kåre Fiedler Christiansen via Otis Gospodnetic)

12. LUCENE-641: fixed an off-by-one bug with IndexWriter.setMaxFieldLength()
    (Daniel Naber)

13. LUCENE-659: Make PerFieldAnalyzerWrapper delegate getPositionIncrementGap()
    to the correct analyzer for the field. (Chuck Williams via Yonik Seeley)

14. LUCENE-650: Fixed NPE in Locale specific String Sort when Document
    has no value.
    (Oliver Hutchison via Chris Hostetter)

15. LUCENE-683: Fixed data corruption when reading lazy loaded fields.
    (Yonik Seeley)

16. LUCENE-678: Fixed bug in NativeFSLockFactory which caused the same
    lock to be shared between different directories.
    (Michael McCandless via Yonik Seeley)

17. LUCENE-690: Fixed thread unsafe use of IndexInput by lazy loaded fields.
    (Yonik Seeley)

18. LUCENE-696: Fix bug when scorer for DisjunctionMaxQuery has skipTo()
    called on it before next().  (Yonik Seeley)

19. LUCENE-569: Fixed SpanNearQuery bug, for 'inOrder' queries it would fail
    to recognize ordered spans if they overlapped with unordered spans.
    (Paul Elschot via Chris Hostetter)

20. LUCENE-706: Updated fileformats.xml|html concerning the docdelta value
    in the frequency file. (Johan Stuyts, Doron Cohen via Grant Ingersoll)

21. LUCENE-715: Fixed private constructor in IndexWriter.java to
    properly release the acquired write lock if there is an
    IOException after acquiring the write lock but before finishing
    instantiation. (Matthew Bogosian via Mike McCandless)

22. LUCENE-651: Multiple different threads requesting the same
    FieldCache entry (often for Sorting by a field) at the same
    time caused multiple generations of that entry, which was
    detrimental to performance and memory use.
    (Oliver Hutchison via Otis Gospodnetic)

23. LUCENE-717: Fixed build.xml not to fail when there is no lib dir.
    (Doron Cohen via Otis Gospodnetic)

24. LUCENE-728: Removed duplicate/old MoreLikeThis and SimilarityQueries
    classes from contrib/similarity, as their new home is under
    contrib/queries.
    (Otis Gospodnetic)

25. LUCENE-669: Do not double-close the RandomAccessFile in
    FSIndexInput/Output during finalize().  Besides sending an
    IOException up to the GC, this may also be the cause intermittent
    "The handle is invalid" IOExceptions on Windows when trying to
    close readers or writers. (Michael Busch via Mike McCandless)

26. LUCENE-702: Fix IndexWriter.addIndexes(*) to not corrupt the index
    on any exceptions (eg disk full).  The semantics of these methods
    is now transactional: either all indices are merged or none are.
    Also fixed IndexWriter.mergeSegments (called outside of
    addIndexes(*) by addDocument, optimize, flushRamSegments) and
    IndexReader.commit() (called by close) to clean up and keep the
    instance state consistent to what's actually in the index (Mike
    McCandless).

27. LUCENE-129: Change finalizers to do "try {...} finally
    {super.finalize();}" to make sure we don't miss finalizers in
    classes above us. (Esmond Pitt via Mike McCandless)

28. LUCENE-754: Fix a problem introduced by LUCENE-651, causing
    IndexReaders to hang around forever, in addition to not
    fixing the original FieldCache performance problem.
    (Chris Hostetter, Yonik Seeley)

29. LUCENE-140: Fix IndexReader.deleteDocument(int docNum) to
    correctly raise ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException when docNum is too
    large.  Previously, if docNum was only slightly too large (within
    the same multiple of 8, ie, up to 7 ints beyond maxDoc), no
    exception would be raised and instead the index would become
    silently corrupted.  The corruption then only appears much later,
    in mergeSegments, when the corrupted segment is merged with
    segment(s) after it. (Mike McCandless)

30. LUCENE-768: Fix case where an Exception during deleteDocument,
    undeleteAll or setNorm in IndexReader could leave the reader in a
    state where close() fails to release the write lock.
    (Mike McCandless)

31. Remove "tvp" from known index file extensions because it is
    never used. (Nicolas Lalevée via Bernhard Messer)
    
32. LUCENE-767: Change how SegmentReader.maxDoc() is computed to not
    rely on file length check and instead use the SegmentInfo's
    docCount that's already stored explicitly in the index.  This is a
    defensive bug fix (ie, there is no known problem seen "in real
    life" due to this, just a possible future problem).  (Chuck
    Williams via Mike McCandless)

Optimizations

  1. LUCENE-586: TermDocs.skipTo() is now more efficient for
     multi-segment indexes.  This will improve the performance of many
     types of queries against a non-optimized index. (Andrew Hudson
     via Yonik Seeley)

  2. LUCENE-623: RAMDirectory.close now nulls out its reference to all
     internal "files", allowing them to be GCed even if references to the
     RAMDirectory itself still exist. (Nadav Har'El via Chris Hostetter)

  3. LUCENE-629: Compressed fields are no longer uncompressed and
     recompressed during segment merges (e.g. during indexing or
     optimizing), thus improving performance . (Michael Busch via Otis
     Gospodnetic)

  4. LUCENE-388: Improve indexing performance when maxBufferedDocs is
     large by keeping a count of buffered documents rather than
     counting after each document addition.  (Doron Cohen, Paul Smith,
     Yonik Seeley)

  5. Modified TermScorer.explain to use TermDocs.skipTo() instead of
     looping through docs. (Grant Ingersoll)

  6. LUCENE-672: New indexing segment merge policy flushes all
     buffered docs to their own segment and delays a merge until
     mergeFactor segments of a certain level have been accumulated.
     This increases indexing performance in the presence of deleted
     docs or partially full segments as well as enabling future
     optimizations.

     NOTE: this also fixes an "under-merging" bug whereby it is
     possible to get far too many segments in your index (which will
     drastically slow down search, risks exhausting file descriptor
     limit, etc.).  This can happen when the number of buffered docs
     at close, plus the number of docs in the last non-ram segment is
     greater than mergeFactor. (Ning Li, Yonik Seeley)

  7. Lazy loaded fields unnecessarily retained an extra copy of loaded
     String data.  (Yonik Seeley)

  8. LUCENE-443: ConjunctionScorer performance increase.  Speed up
     any BooleanQuery with more than one mandatory clause.
     (Abdul Chaudhry, Paul Elschot via Yonik Seeley)

  9. LUCENE-365: DisjunctionSumScorer performance increase of
     ~30%. Speeds up queries with optional clauses. (Paul Elschot via
     Yonik Seeley)

 10. LUCENE-695: Optimized BufferedIndexInput.readBytes() for medium
     size buffers, which will speed up merging and retrieving binary
     and compressed fields.  (Nadav Har'El via Yonik Seeley)

 11. LUCENE-687: Lazy skipping on proximity file speeds up most
     queries involving term positions, including phrase queries.
     (Michael Busch via Yonik Seeley)

 12. LUCENE-714: Replaced 2 cases of manual for-loop array copying
     with calls to System.arraycopy instead, in DocumentWriter.java.
     (Nicolas Lalevee via Mike McCandless)

 13. LUCENE-729: Non-recursive skipTo and next implementation of
     TermDocs for a MultiReader.  The old implementation could
     recurse up to the number of segments in the index. (Yonik Seeley)

 14. LUCENE-739: Improve segment merging performance by reusing
     the norm array across different fields and doing bulk writes
     of norms of segments with no deleted docs.
    (Michael Busch via Yonik Seeley)

 15. LUCENE-745: Add BooleanQuery.clauses(), allowing direct access
     to the List of clauses and replaced the internal synchronized Vector
     with an unsynchronized List. (Yonik Seeley)

 16. LUCENE-750: Remove finalizers from FSIndexOutput and move the
     FSIndexInput finalizer to the actual file so all clones don't
     register a new finalizer. (Yonik Seeley)

Test Cases

  1. Added TestTermScorer.java (Grant Ingersoll)

  2. Added TestWindowsMMap.java (Benson Margulies via Mike McCandless)

  3. LUCENE-744 Append the user.name property onto the temporary directory 
     that is created so it doesn't interfere with other users. (Grant Ingersoll)

Documentation

  1. Added style sheet to xdocs named lucene.css and included in the
     Anakia VSL descriptor.  (Grant Ingersoll)

  2. Added scoring.xml document into xdocs.  Updated Similarity.java
     scoring formula.(Grant Ingersoll and Steve Rowe.  Updates from:
     Michael McCandless, Doron Cohen, Chris Hostetter, Doug Cutting).
     Issue 664.

  3. Added javadocs for FieldSelectorResult.java. (Grant Ingersoll)

  4. Moved xdocs directory to src/site/src/documentation/content/xdocs per
     Issue 707.  Site now builds using Forrest, just like the other Lucene
     siblings.  See http://wiki.apache.org/jakarta-lucene/HowToUpdateTheWebsite
     for info on updating the website. (Grant Ingersoll with help from Steve Rowe,
     Chris Hostetter, Doug Cutting, Otis Gospodnetic, Yonik Seeley)

  5. Added in Developer and System Requirements sections under Resources (Grant Ingersoll)

  6. LUCENE-713 Updated the Term Vector section of File Formats to include
     documentation on how Offset and Position info are stored in the TVF file.
     (Grant Ingersoll, Samir Abdou)

  7. Added in link to Clover Test Code Coverage Reports under the Develop
     section in Resources (Grant Ingersoll)

  8. LUCENE-748: Added details for semantics of IndexWriter.close on
     hitting an Exception.  (Jed Wesley-Smith via Mike McCandless)

  9. Added some text about what is contained in releases.
     (Eric Haszlakiewicz via Grant Ingersoll)

  10. LUCENE-758: Fix javadoc to clarify that RAMDirectory(Directory)
      makes a full copy of the starting Directory.  (Mike McCandless)

  11. LUCENE-764: Fix javadocs to detail temporary space requirements
      for IndexWriter's optimize(), addIndexes(*) and addDocument(...)
      methods.  (Mike McCandless)

Build

  1. Added in clover test code coverage per http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-721
     To enable clover code coverage, you must have clover.jar in the ANT
     classpath and specify -Drun.clover=true on the command line.
     (Michael Busch and Grant Ingersoll)

  2. Added a sysproperty in common-build.xml per Lucene 752 to map java.io.tmpdir to
     ${build.dir}/test just like the tempDir sysproperty.

  3. LUCENE-757 Added new target named init-dist that does setup for
     distribution of both binary and source distributions.  Called by package 
     and package-*-src

======================= Release 2.0.0 =======================

API Changes

 1. All deprecated methods and fields have been removed, except
    DateField, which will still be supported for some time
    so Lucene can read its date fields from old indexes
    (Yonik Seeley & Grant Ingersoll)

 2. DisjunctionSumScorer is no longer public.
    (Paul Elschot via Otis Gospodnetic)

 3. Creating a Field with both an empty name and an empty value
    now throws an IllegalArgumentException
    (Daniel Naber)

 4. LUCENE-301: Added new IndexWriter({String,File,Directory},
    Analyzer) constructors that do not take a boolean "create"
    argument.  These new constructors will create a new index if
    necessary, else append to the existing one.  (Dan Armbrust via
    Mike McCandless)

New features

 1. LUCENE-496: Command line tool for modifying the field norms of an
    existing index; added to contrib/miscellaneous.  (Chris Hostetter)

 2. LUCENE-577: SweetSpotSimilarity added to contrib/miscellaneous.
    (Chris Hostetter)
    
Bug fixes

 1. LUCENE-330: Fix issue of FilteredQuery not working properly within
    BooleanQuery.  (Paul Elschot via Erik Hatcher)

 2. LUCENE-515: Make ConstantScoreRangeQuery and ConstantScoreQuery work
    with RemoteSearchable.  (Philippe Laflamme via Yonik Seeley)

 3. Added methods to get/set writeLockTimeout and commitLockTimeout in
    IndexWriter. These could be set in Lucene 1.4 using a system property.
    This feature had been removed without adding the corresponding
    getter/setter methods.  (Daniel Naber)

 4. LUCENE-413: Fixed ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException exceptions
    when using SpanQueries. (Paul Elschot via Yonik Seeley)

 5. Implemented FilterIndexReader.getVersion() and isCurrent()
    (Yonik Seeley)

 6. LUCENE-540: Fixed a bug with IndexWriter.addIndexes(Directory[])
    that sometimes caused the index order of documents to change.
    (Yonik Seeley)

 7. LUCENE-526: Fixed a bug in FieldSortedHitQueue that caused
    subsequent String sorts with different locales to sort identically.
    (Paul Cowan via Yonik Seeley)

 8. LUCENE-541: Add missing extractTerms() to DisjunctionMaxQuery
    (Stefan Will via Yonik Seeley)

 9. LUCENE-514: Added getTermArrays() and extractTerms() to
    MultiPhraseQuery (Eric Jain & Yonik Seeley)

10. LUCENE-512: Fixed ClassCastException in ParallelReader.getTermFreqVectors
    (frederic via Yonik)

11. LUCENE-352: Fixed bug in SpanNotQuery that manifested as
    NullPointerException when "exclude" query was not a SpanTermQuery.
    (Chris Hostetter)

12. LUCENE-572: Fixed bug in SpanNotQuery hashCode, was ignoring exclude clause
    (Chris Hostetter)

13. LUCENE-561: Fixed some ParallelReader bugs. NullPointerException if the reader
    didn't know about the field yet, reader didn't keep track if it had deletions,
    and deleteDocument calls could circumvent synchronization on the subreaders.
    (Chuck Williams via Yonik Seeley)

14. LUCENE-556: Added empty extractTerms() implementation to MatchAllDocsQuery and
    ConstantScoreQuery in order to allow their use with a MultiSearcher.
    (Yonik Seeley)

15. LUCENE-546: Removed 2GB file size limitations for RAMDirectory.
    (Peter Royal, Michael Chan, Yonik Seeley)

16. LUCENE-485: Don't hold commit lock while removing obsolete index
    files.  (Luc Vanlerberghe via cutting)


1.9.1

Bug fixes

 1. LUCENE-511: Fix a bug in the BufferedIndexOutput optimization
    introduced in 1.9-final.  (Shay Banon & Steven Tamm via cutting)

1.9 final

Note that this release is mostly but not 100% source compatible with
the previous release of Lucene (1.4.3). In other words, you should
make sure your application compiles with this version of Lucene before
you replace the old Lucene JAR with the new one.  Many methods have
been deprecated in anticipation of release 2.0, so deprecation
warnings are to be expected when upgrading from 1.4.3 to 1.9.

Bug fixes
 
 1. The fix that made IndexWriter.setMaxBufferedDocs(1) work had negative 
    effects on indexing performance and has thus been reverted. The 
    argument for setMaxBufferedDocs(int) must now at least be 2, otherwise
    an exception is thrown. (Daniel Naber)
 
Optimizations
     
 1. Optimized BufferedIndexOutput.writeBytes() to use
    System.arraycopy() in more cases, rather than copying byte-by-byte.
    (Lukas Zapletal via Cutting)

1.9 RC1

Requirements

 1. To compile and use Lucene you now need Java 1.4 or later.

Changes in runtime behavior

 1. FuzzyQuery can no longer throw a TooManyClauses exception. If a
    FuzzyQuery expands to more than BooleanQuery.maxClauseCount
    terms only the BooleanQuery.maxClauseCount most similar terms
    go into the rewritten query and thus the exception is avoided.
    (Christoph)

 2. Changed system property from "org.apache.lucene.lockdir" to
    "org.apache.lucene.lockDir", so that its casing follows the existing
    pattern used in other Lucene system properties. (Bernhard)

 3. The terms of RangeQueries and FuzzyQueries are now converted to
    lowercase by default (as it has been the case for PrefixQueries
    and WildcardQueries before). Use setLowercaseExpandedTerms(false)
    to disable that behavior but note that this also affects
    PrefixQueries and WildcardQueries. (Daniel Naber)

 4. Document frequency that is computed when MultiSearcher is used is now
    computed correctly and "globally" across subsearchers and indices, while
    before it used to be computed locally to each index, which caused
    ranking across multiple indices not to be equivalent.
    (Chuck Williams, Wolf Siberski via Otis, bug #31841)

 5. When opening an IndexWriter with create=true, Lucene now only deletes
    its own files from the index directory (looking at the file name suffixes
    to decide if a file belongs to Lucene). The old behavior was to delete
    all files. (Daniel Naber and Bernhard Messer, bug #34695)

 6. The version of an IndexReader, as returned by getCurrentVersion()
    and getVersion() doesn't start at 0 anymore for new indexes. Instead, it
    is now initialized by the system time in milliseconds.
    (Bernhard Messer via Daniel Naber)

 7. Several default values cannot be set via system properties anymore, as
    this has been considered inappropriate for a library like Lucene. For
    most properties there are set/get methods available in IndexWriter which
    you should use instead. This affects the following properties:
    See IndexWriter for getter/setter methods:
      org.apache.lucene.writeLockTimeout, org.apache.lucene.commitLockTimeout,
      org.apache.lucene.minMergeDocs, org.apache.lucene.maxMergeDocs,
      org.apache.lucene.maxFieldLength, org.apache.lucene.termIndexInterval,
      org.apache.lucene.mergeFactor,
    See BooleanQuery for getter/setter methods:
      org.apache.lucene.maxClauseCount
    See FSDirectory for getter/setter methods:
      disableLuceneLocks
    (Daniel Naber)

 8. Fixed FieldCacheImpl to use user-provided IntParser and FloatParser,
    instead of using Integer and Float classes for parsing.
    (Yonik Seeley via Otis Gospodnetic)

 9. Expert level search routines returning TopDocs and TopFieldDocs
    no longer normalize scores.  This also fixes bugs related to
    MultiSearchers and score sorting/normalization.
    (Luc Vanlerberghe via Yonik Seeley, LUCENE-469)

New features

 1. Added support for stored compressed fields (patch #31149)
    (Bernhard Messer via Christoph)

 2. Added support for binary stored fields (patch #29370)
    (Drew Farris and Bernhard Messer via Christoph)

 3. Added support for position and offset information in term vectors
    (patch #18927). (Grant Ingersoll & Christoph)

 4. A new class DateTools has been added. It allows you to format dates
    in a readable format adequate for indexing. Unlike the existing
    DateField class DateTools can cope with dates before 1970 and it
    forces you to specify the desired date resolution (e.g. month, day,
    second, ...) which can make RangeQuerys on those fields more efficient.
    (Daniel Naber)

 5. QueryParser now correctly works with Analyzers that can return more
    than one token per position. For example, a query "+fast +car"
    would be parsed as "+fast +(car automobile)" if the Analyzer
    returns "car" and "automobile" at the same position whenever it
    finds "car" (Patch #23307).
    (Pierrick Brihaye, Daniel Naber)

 6. Permit unbuffered Directory implementations (e.g., using mmap).
    InputStream is replaced by the new classes IndexInput and
    BufferedIndexInput.  OutputStream is replaced by the new classes
    IndexOutput and BufferedIndexOutput.  InputStream and OutputStream
    are now deprecated and FSDirectory is now subclassable. (cutting)

 7. Add native Directory and TermDocs implementations that work under
    GCJ.  These require GCC 3.4.0 or later and have only been tested
    on Linux.  Use 'ant gcj' to build demo applications. (cutting)

 8. Add MMapDirectory, which uses nio to mmap input files.  This is
    still somewhat slower than FSDirectory.  However it uses less
    memory per query term, since a new buffer is not allocated per
    term, which may help applications which use, e.g., wildcard
    queries.  It may also someday be faster. (cutting & Paul Elschot)

 9. Added javadocs-internal to build.xml - bug #30360
    (Paul Elschot via Otis)

10. Added RangeFilter, a more generically useful filter than DateFilter.
    (Chris M Hostetter via Erik)

11. Added NumberTools, a utility class indexing numeric fields.
    (adapted from code contributed by Matt Quail; committed by Erik)

12. Added public static IndexReader.main(String[] args) method.
    IndexReader can now be used directly at command line level
    to list and optionally extract the individual files from an existing
    compound index file.
    (adapted from code contributed by Garrett Rooney; committed by Bernhard)

13. Add IndexWriter.setTermIndexInterval() method.  See javadocs.
    (Doug Cutting)

14. Added LucenePackage, whose static get() method returns java.util.Package,
    which lets the caller get the Lucene version information specified in
    the Lucene Jar.
    (Doug Cutting via Otis)

15. Added Hits.iterator() method and corresponding HitIterator and Hit objects.
    This provides standard java.util.Iterator iteration over Hits.
    Each call to the iterator's next() method returns a Hit object.
    (Jeremy Rayner via Erik)

16. Add ParallelReader, an IndexReader that combines separate indexes
    over different fields into a single virtual index.  (Doug Cutting)

17. Add IntParser and FloatParser interfaces to FieldCache, so that
    fields in arbitrarily formats can be cached as ints and floats.
    (Doug Cutting)

18. Added class org.apache.lucene.index.IndexModifier which combines
    IndexWriter and IndexReader, so you can add and delete documents without
    worrying about synchronization/locking issues.
    (Daniel Naber)

19. Lucene can now be used inside an unsigned applet, as Lucene's access
    to system properties will not cause a SecurityException anymore.
    (Jon Schuster via Daniel Naber, bug #34359)

20. Added a new class MatchAllDocsQuery that matches all documents.
    (John Wang via Daniel Naber, bug #34946)

21. Added ability to omit norms on a per field basis to decrease
    index size and memory consumption when there are many indexed fields.
    See Field.setOmitNorms()
    (Yonik Seeley, LUCENE-448)

22. Added NullFragmenter to contrib/highlighter, which is useful for
    highlighting entire documents or fields.
    (Erik Hatcher)

23. Added regular expression queries, RegexQuery and SpanRegexQuery.
    Note the same term enumeration caveats apply with these queries as
    apply to WildcardQuery and other term expanding queries.
    These two new queries are not currently supported via QueryParser.
    (Erik Hatcher)

24. Added ConstantScoreQuery which wraps a filter and produces a score
    equal to the query boost for every matching document.
    (Yonik Seeley, LUCENE-383)

25. Added ConstantScoreRangeQuery which produces a constant score for
    every document in the range.  One advantage over a normal RangeQuery
    is that it doesn't expand to a BooleanQuery and thus doesn't have a maximum
    number of terms the range can cover.  Both endpoints may also be open.
    (Yonik Seeley, LUCENE-383)

26. Added ability to specify a minimum number of optional clauses that
    must match in a BooleanQuery.  See BooleanQuery.setMinimumNumberShouldMatch().
    (Paul Elschot, Chris Hostetter via Yonik Seeley, LUCENE-395)

27. Added DisjunctionMaxQuery which provides the maximum score across its clauses.
    It's very useful for searching across multiple fields.
    (Chuck Williams via Yonik Seeley, LUCENE-323)

28. New class ISOLatin1AccentFilter that replaces accented characters in the ISO
    Latin 1 character set by their unaccented equivalent.
    (Sven Duzont via Erik Hatcher)

29. New class KeywordAnalyzer. "Tokenizes" the entire stream as a single token.
    This is useful for data like zip codes, ids, and some product names.
    (Erik Hatcher)

30. Copied LengthFilter from contrib area to core. Removes words that are too
    long and too short from the stream.
    (David Spencer via Otis and Daniel)

31. Added getPositionIncrementGap(String fieldName) to Analyzer.  This allows
    custom analyzers to put gaps between Field instances with the same field
    name, preventing phrase or span queries crossing these boundaries.  The
    default implementation issues a gap of 0, allowing the default token
    position increment of 1 to put the next field's first token into a
    successive position.
    (Erik Hatcher, with advice from Yonik)

32. StopFilter can now ignore case when checking for stop words.
    (Grant Ingersoll via Yonik, LUCENE-248)

33. Add TopDocCollector and TopFieldDocCollector.  These simplify the
    implementation of hit collectors that collect only the
    top-scoring or top-sorting hits.

API Changes

 1. Several methods and fields have been deprecated. The API documentation
    contains information about the recommended replacements. It is planned
    that most of the deprecated methods and fields will be removed in
    Lucene 2.0. (Daniel Naber)

 2. The Russian and the German analyzers have been moved to contrib/analyzers.
    Also, the WordlistLoader class has been moved one level up in the
    hierarchy and is now org.apache.lucene.analysis.WordlistLoader
    (Daniel Naber)

 3. The API contained methods that declared to throw an IOException
    but that never did this. These declarations have been removed. If
    your code tries to catch these exceptions you might need to remove
    those catch clauses to avoid compile errors. (Daniel Naber)

 4. Add a serializable Parameter Class to standardize parameter enum
    classes in BooleanClause and Field. (Christoph)

 5. Added rewrite methods to all SpanQuery subclasses that nest other SpanQuerys.
    This allows custom SpanQuery subclasses that rewrite (for term expansion, for
    example) to nest within the built-in SpanQuery classes successfully.

Bug fixes

 1. The JSP demo page (src/jsp/results.jsp) now properly closes the
    IndexSearcher it opens. (Daniel Naber)

 2. Fixed a bug in IndexWriter.addIndexes(IndexReader[] readers) that
    prevented deletion of obsolete segments. (Christoph Goller)

 3. Fix in FieldInfos to avoid the return of an extra blank field in
    IndexReader.getFieldNames() (Patch #19058). (Mark Harwood via Bernhard)

 4. Some combinations of BooleanQuery and MultiPhraseQuery (formerly
    PhrasePrefixQuery) could provoke UnsupportedOperationException
    (bug #33161). (Rhett Sutphin via Daniel Naber)

 5. Small bug in skipTo of ConjunctionScorer that caused NullPointerException
    if skipTo() was called without prior call to next() fixed. (Christoph)

 6. Disable Similiarty.coord() in the scoring of most automatically
    generated boolean queries.  The coord() score factor is
    appropriate when clauses are independently specified by a user,
    but is usually not appropriate when clauses are generated
    automatically, e.g., by a fuzzy, wildcard or range query.  Matches
    on such automatically generated queries are no longer penalized
    for not matching all terms.  (Doug Cutting, Patch #33472)

 7. Getting a lock file with Lock.obtain(long) was supposed to wait for
    a given amount of milliseconds, but this didn't work.
    (John Wang via Daniel Naber, Bug #33799)

 8. Fix FSDirectory.createOutput() to always create new files.
    Previously, existing files were overwritten, and an index could be
    corrupted when the old version of a file was longer than the new.
    Now any existing file is first removed.  (Doug Cutting)

 9. Fix BooleanQuery containing nested SpanTermQuery's, which previously
    could return an incorrect number of hits.
    (Reece Wilton via Erik Hatcher, Bug #35157)

10. Fix NullPointerException that could occur with a MultiPhraseQuery
    inside a BooleanQuery.
    (Hans Hjelm and Scotty Allen via Daniel Naber, Bug #35626)

11. Fixed SnowballFilter to pass through the position increment from
    the original token.
    (Yonik Seeley via Erik Hatcher, LUCENE-437)

12. Added Unicode range of Korean characters to StandardTokenizer,
    grouping contiguous characters into a token rather than one token
    per character.  This change also changes the token type to "<CJ>"
    for Chinese and Japanese character tokens (previously it was "<CJK>").
    (Cheolgoo Kang via Otis and Erik, LUCENE-444 and LUCENE-461)

13. FieldsReader now looks at FieldInfo.storeOffsetWithTermVector and
    FieldInfo.storePositionWithTermVector and creates the Field with
    correct TermVector parameter.
    (Frank Steinmann via Bernhard, LUCENE-455)

14. Fixed WildcardQuery to prevent "cat" matching "ca??".
    (Xiaozheng Ma via Bernhard, LUCENE-306)

15. Fixed a bug where MultiSearcher and ParallelMultiSearcher could
    change the sort order when sorting by string for documents without
    a value for the sort field.
    (Luc Vanlerberghe via Yonik, LUCENE-453)

16. Fixed a sorting problem with MultiSearchers that can lead to
    missing or duplicate docs due to equal docs sorting in an arbitrary order.
    (Yonik Seeley, LUCENE-456)

17. A single hit using the expert level sorted search methods
    resulted in the score not being normalized.
    (Yonik Seeley, LUCENE-462)

18. Fixed inefficient memory usage when loading an index into RAMDirectory.
    (Volodymyr Bychkoviak via Bernhard, LUCENE-475)

19. Corrected term offsets returned by ChineseTokenizer.
    (Ray Tsang via Erik Hatcher, LUCENE-324)

20. Fixed MultiReader.undeleteAll() to correctly update numDocs.
    (Robert Kirchgessner via Doug Cutting, LUCENE-479)

21. Race condition in IndexReader.getCurrentVersion() and isCurrent()
    fixed by acquiring the commit lock.
    (Luc Vanlerberghe via Yonik Seeley, LUCENE-481)

22. IndexWriter.setMaxBufferedDocs(1) didn't have the expected effect,
    this has now been fixed. (Daniel Naber)

23. Fixed QueryParser when called with a date in local form like 
    "[1/16/2000 TO 1/18/2000]". This query did not include the documents
    of 1/18/2000, i.e. the last day was not included. (Daniel Naber)

24. Removed sorting constraint that threw an exception if there were
    not yet any values for the sort field (Yonik Seeley, LUCENE-374)

Optimizations
     
 1. Disk usage (peak requirements during indexing and optimization)
    in case of compound file format has been improved. 
    (Bernhard, Dmitry, and Christoph)

 2. Optimize the performance of certain uses of BooleanScorer,
    TermScorer and IndexSearcher.  In particular, a BooleanQuery
    composed of TermQuery, with not all terms required, that returns a
    TopDocs (e.g., through a Hits with no Sort specified) runs much
    faster.  (cutting)
    
 3. Removed synchronization from reading of term vectors with an
    IndexReader (Patch #30736). (Bernhard Messer via Christoph)

 4. Optimize term-dictionary lookup to allocate far fewer terms when
    scanning for the matching term.  This speeds searches involving
    low-frequency terms, where the cost of dictionary lookup can be
    significant. (cutting)

 5. Optimize fuzzy queries so the standard fuzzy queries with a prefix 
    of 0 now run 20-50% faster (Patch #31882).
    (Jonathan Hager via Daniel Naber)
    
 6. A Version of BooleanScorer (BooleanScorer2) added that delivers
    documents in increasing order and implements skipTo. For queries
    with required or forbidden clauses it may be faster than the old
    BooleanScorer, for BooleanQueries consisting only of optional
    clauses it is probably slower. The new BooleanScorer is now the
    default. (Patch 31785 by Paul Elschot via Christoph)

 7. Use uncached access to norms when merging to reduce RAM usage.
    (Bug #32847).  (Doug Cutting)

 8. Don't read term index when random-access is not required.  This
    reduces time to open IndexReaders and they use less memory when
    random access is not required, e.g., when merging segments.  The
    term index is now read into memory lazily at the first
    random-access.  (Doug Cutting)

 9. Optimize IndexWriter.addIndexes(Directory[]) when the number of
    added indexes is larger than mergeFactor.  Previously this could
    result in quadratic performance.  Now performance is n log(n).
    (Doug Cutting)

10. Speed up the creation of TermEnum for indices with multiple
    segments and deleted documents, and thus speed up PrefixQuery,
    RangeQuery, WildcardQuery, FuzzyQuery, RangeFilter, DateFilter,
    and sorting the first time on a field.
    (Yonik Seeley, LUCENE-454)

11. Optimized and generalized 32 bit floating point to byte
    (custom 8 bit floating point) conversions.  Increased the speed of
    Similarity.encodeNorm() anywhere from 10% to 250%, depending on the JVM.
    (Yonik Seeley, LUCENE-467)

Infrastructure

 1. Lucene's source code repository has converted from CVS to
    Subversion.  The new repository is at
    http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/lucene/java/trunk

 2. Lucene's issue tracker has migrated from Bugzilla to JIRA.
    Lucene's JIRA is at http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE
    The old issues are still available at
    http://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=xxxx
    (use the bug number instead of xxxx)


1.4.3

 1. The JSP demo page (src/jsp/results.jsp) now properly escapes error
    messages which might contain user input (e.g. error messages about 
    query parsing). If you used that page as a starting point for your
    own code please make sure your code also properly escapes HTML
    characters from user input in order to avoid so-called cross site
    scripting attacks. (Daniel Naber)
  
  2. QueryParser changes in 1.4.2 broke the QueryParser API. Now the old 
     API is supported again. (Christoph)


1.4.2

 1. Fixed bug #31241: Sorting could lead to incorrect results (documents
    missing, others duplicated) if the sort keys were not unique and there
    were more than 100 matches. (Daniel Naber)

 2. Memory leak in Sort code (bug #31240) eliminated.
    (Rafal Krzewski via Christoph and Daniel)
    
 3. FuzzyQuery now takes an additional parameter that specifies the
    minimum similarity that is required for a term to match the query.
    The QueryParser syntax for this is term~x, where x is a floating 
    point number >= 0 and < 1 (a bigger number means that a higher
    similarity is required). Furthermore, a prefix can be specified
    for FuzzyQuerys so that only those terms are considered similar that 
    start with this prefix. This can speed up FuzzyQuery greatly.
    (Daniel Naber, Christoph Goller)
    
 4. PhraseQuery and PhrasePrefixQuery now allow the explicit specification
    of relative positions. (Christoph Goller)
    
 5. QueryParser changes: Fix for ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsExceptions 
    (patch #9110); some unused method parameters removed; The ability
    to specify a minimum similarity for FuzzyQuery has been added.
    (Christoph Goller)

 6. IndexSearcher optimization: a new ScoreDoc is no longer allocated
    for every non-zero-scoring hit.  This makes 'OR' queries that
    contain common terms substantially faster.  (cutting)


1.4.1

 1. Fixed a performance bug in hit sorting code, where values were not
    correctly cached.  (Aviran via cutting)

 2. Fixed errors in file format documentation. (Daniel Naber)


1.4 final

 1. Added "an" to the list of stop words in StopAnalyzer, to complement
    the existing "a" there.  Fix for bug 28960
     (http://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=28960). (Otis)

 2. Added new class FieldCache to manage in-memory caches of field term
    values.  (Tim Jones)

 3. Added overloaded getFieldQuery method to QueryParser which
    accepts the slop factor specified for the phrase (or the default
    phrase slop for the QueryParser instance).  This allows overriding
    methods to replace a PhraseQuery with a SpanNearQuery instead,
    keeping the proper slop factor. (Erik Hatcher)

 4. Changed the encoding of GermanAnalyzer.java and GermanStemmer.java to
    UTF-8 and changed the build encoding to UTF-8, to make changed files
    compile. (Otis Gospodnetic)

 5. Removed synchronization from term lookup under IndexReader methods
    termFreq(), termDocs() or termPositions() to improve
    multi-threaded performance.  (cutting)

 6. Fix a bug where obsolete segment files were not deleted on Win32.


1.4 RC3

 1. Fixed several search bugs introduced by the skipTo() changes in
    release 1.4RC1.  The index file format was changed a bit, so
    collections must be re-indexed to take advantage of the skipTo()
    optimizations.  (Christoph Goller)

 2. Added new Document methods, removeField() and removeFields().
    (Christoph Goller)

 3. Fixed inconsistencies with index closing.  Indexes and directories
    are now only closed automatically by Lucene when Lucene opened
    them automatically.  (Christoph Goller)

 4. Added new class: FilteredQuery.  (Tim Jones)

 5. Added a new SortField type for custom comparators.  (Tim Jones)

 6. Lock obtain timed out message now displays the full path to the lock
    file. (Daniel Naber via Erik)

 7. Fixed a bug in SpanNearQuery when ordered. (Paul Elschot via cutting)

 8. Fixed so that FSDirectory's locks still work when the
    java.io.tmpdir system property is null.  (cutting)

 9. Changed FilteredTermEnum's constructor to take no parameters,
    as the parameters were ignored anyway (bug #28858)

1.4 RC2

 1. GermanAnalyzer now throws an exception if the stopword file
    cannot be found (bug #27987). It now uses LowerCaseFilter
    (bug #18410) (Daniel Naber via Otis, Erik)

 2. Fixed a few bugs in the file format documentation. (cutting)


1.4 RC1

 1. Changed the format of the .tis file, so that:

    - it has a format version number, which makes it easier to
      back-compatibly change file formats in the future.

    - the term count is now stored as a long.  This was the one aspect
      of the Lucene's file formats which limited index size.

    - a few internal index parameters are now stored in the index, so
      that they can (in theory) now be changed from index to index,
      although there is not yet an API to do so.

    These changes are back compatible.  The new code can read old
    indexes.  But old code will not be able read new indexes. (cutting)

 2. Added an optimized implementation of TermDocs.skipTo().  A skip
    table is now stored for each term in the .frq file.  This only
    adds a percent or two to overall index size, but can substantially
    speedup many searches.  (cutting)

 3. Restructured the Scorer API and all Scorer implementations to take
    advantage of an optimized TermDocs.skipTo() implementation.  In
    particular, PhraseQuerys and conjunctive BooleanQuerys are
    faster when one clause has substantially fewer matches than the
    others.  (A conjunctive BooleanQuery is a BooleanQuery where all
    clauses are required.)  (cutting)

 4. Added new class ParallelMultiSearcher.  Combined with
    RemoteSearchable this makes it easy to implement distributed
    search systems.  (Jean-Francois Halleux via cutting)

 5. Added support for hit sorting.  Results may now be sorted by any
    indexed field.  For details see the javadoc for
    Searcher#search(Query, Sort).  (Tim Jones via Cutting)

 6. Changed FSDirectory to auto-create a full directory tree that it
    needs by using mkdirs() instead of mkdir().  (Mladen Turk via Otis)

 7. Added a new span-based query API.  This implements, among other
    things, nested phrases.  See javadocs for details.  (Doug Cutting)

 8. Added new method Query.getSimilarity(Searcher), and changed
    scorers to use it.  This permits one to subclass a Query class so
    that it can specify its own Similarity implementation, perhaps
    one that delegates through that of the Searcher.  (Julien Nioche
    via Cutting)

 9. Added MultiReader, an IndexReader that combines multiple other
    IndexReaders.  (Cutting)

10. Added support for term vectors.  See Field#isTermVectorStored().
    (Grant Ingersoll, Cutting & Dmitry)

11. Fixed the old bug with escaping of special characters in query
    strings: http://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=24665
    (Jean-Francois Halleux via Otis)

12. Added support for overriding default values for the following,
    using system properties:
      - default commit lock timeout
      - default maxFieldLength
      - default maxMergeDocs
      - default mergeFactor
      - default minMergeDocs
      - default write lock timeout
    (Otis)

13. Changed QueryParser.jj to allow '-' and '+' within tokens:
    http://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=27491
    (Morus Walter via Otis)

14. Changed so that the compound index format is used by default.
    This makes indexing a bit slower, but vastly reduces the chances
    of file handle problems.  (Cutting)


1.3 final

 1. Added catch of BooleanQuery$TooManyClauses in QueryParser to
    throw ParseException instead. (Erik Hatcher)

 2. Fixed a NullPointerException in Query.explain(). (Doug Cutting)

 3. Added a new method IndexReader.setNorm(), that permits one to
    alter the boosting of fields after an index is created.

 4. Distinguish between the final position and length when indexing a
    field.  The length is now defined as the total number of tokens,
    instead of the final position, as it was previously.  Length is
    used for score normalization (Similarity.lengthNorm()) and for
    controlling memory usage (IndexWriter.maxFieldLength).  In both of
    these cases, the total number of tokens is a better value to use
    than the final token position.  Position is used in phrase
    searching (see PhraseQuery and Token.setPositionIncrement()).

 5. Fix StandardTokenizer's handling of CJK characters (Chinese,
    Japanese and Korean ideograms).  Previously contiguous sequences
    were combined in a single token, which is not very useful.  Now
    each ideogram generates a separate token, which is more useful.


1.3 RC3

 1. Added minMergeDocs in IndexWriter.  This can be raised to speed
    indexing without altering the number of files, but only using more
    memory.  (Julien Nioche via Otis)

 2. Fix bug #24786, in query rewriting. (bschneeman via Cutting)

 3. Fix bug #16952, in demo HTML parser, skip comments in
    javascript. (Christoph Goller)

 4. Fix bug #19253, in demo HTML parser, add whitespace as needed to
    output (Daniel Naber via Christoph Goller)

 5. Fix bug #24301, in demo HTML parser, long titles no longer
    hang things. (Christoph Goller)

 6. Fix bug #23534, Replace use of file timestamp of segments file
    with an index version number stored in the segments file.  This
    resolves problems when running on file systems with low-resolution
    timestamps, e.g., HFS under MacOS X.  (Christoph Goller)

 7. Fix QueryParser so that TokenMgrError is not thrown, only
    ParseException.  (Erik Hatcher)

 8. Fix some bugs introduced by change 11 of RC2.  (Christoph Goller)

 9. Fixed a problem compiling TestRussianStem.  (Christoph Goller)

10. Cleaned up some build stuff.  (Erik Hatcher)


1.3 RC2

 1. Added getFieldNames(boolean) to IndexReader, SegmentReader, and
    SegmentsReader. (Julien Nioche via otis)

 2. Changed file locking to place lock files in
    System.getProperty("java.io.tmpdir"), where all users are
    permitted to write files.  This way folks can open and correctly
    lock indexes which are read-only to them.

 3. IndexWriter: added a new method, addDocument(Document, Analyzer),
    permitting one to easily use different analyzers for different
    documents in the same index.

 4. Minor enhancements to FuzzyTermEnum.
    (Christoph Goller via Otis)

 5. PriorityQueue: added insert(Object) method and adjusted IndexSearcher
    and MultiIndexSearcher to use it.
    (Christoph Goller via Otis)

 6. Fixed a bug in IndexWriter that returned incorrect docCount().
    (Christoph Goller via Otis)

 7. Fixed SegmentsReader to eliminate the confusing and slightly different
    behaviour of TermEnum when dealing with an enumeration of all terms,
    versus an enumeration starting from a specific term.
    This patch also fixes incorrect term document frequencies when the same term
    is present in multiple segments.
    (Christoph Goller via Otis)

 8. Added CachingWrapperFilter and PerFieldAnalyzerWrapper. (Erik Hatcher)

 9. Added support for the new "compound file" index format (Dmitry
    Serebrennikov)

10. Added Locale setting to QueryParser, for use by date range parsing.

11. Changed IndexReader so that it can be subclassed by classes
    outside of its package.  Previously it had package-private
    abstract methods.  Also modified the index merging code so that it
    can work on an arbitrary IndexReader implementation, and added a
    new method, IndexWriter.addIndexes(IndexReader[]), to take
    advantage of this. (cutting)

12. Added a limit to the number of clauses which may be added to a
    BooleanQuery.  The default limit is 1024 clauses.  This should
    stop most OutOfMemoryExceptions by prefix, wildcard and fuzzy
    queries which run amok. (cutting)

13. Add new method: IndexReader.undeleteAll().  This undeletes all
    deleted documents which still remain in the index. (cutting)


1.3 RC1

 1. Fixed PriorityQueue's clear() method.
    Fix for bug 9454, http://nagoya.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=9454
    (Matthijs Bomhoff via otis)

 2. Changed StandardTokenizer.jj grammar for EMAIL tokens.
    Fix for bug 9015, http://nagoya.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=9015
    (Dale Anson via otis)

 3. Added the ability to disable lock creation by using disableLuceneLocks
    system property.  This is useful for read-only media, such as CD-ROMs.
    (otis)

 4. Added id method to Hits to be able to access the index global id.
    Required for sorting options.
    (carlson)

 5. Added support for new range query syntax to QueryParser.jj.
    (briangoetz)

 6. Added the ability to retrieve HTML documents' META tag values to
    HTMLParser.jj.
    (Mark Harwood via otis)

 7. Modified QueryParser to make it possible to programmatically specify the
    default Boolean operator (OR or AND).
    (Péter Halácsy via otis)

 8. Made many search methods and classes non-final, per requests.
    This includes IndexWriter and IndexSearcher, among others.
    (cutting)

 9. Added class RemoteSearchable, providing support for remote
    searching via RMI.  The test class RemoteSearchableTest.java
    provides an example of how this can be used.  (cutting)

 10. Added PhrasePrefixQuery (and supporting MultipleTermPositions).  The
     test class TestPhrasePrefixQuery provides the usage example.
     (Anders Nielsen via otis)

 11. Changed the German stemming algorithm to ignore case while
     stripping. The new algorithm is faster and produces more equal
     stems from nouns and verbs derived from the same word.
     (gschwarz)

 12. Added support for boosting the score of documents and fields via
     the new methods Document.setBoost(float) and Field.setBoost(float).

     Note: This changes the encoding of an indexed value.  Indexes
     should be re-created from scratch in order for search scores to
     be correct.  With the new code and an old index, searches will
     yield very large scores for shorter fields, and very small scores
     for longer fields.  Once the index is re-created, scores will be
     as before. (cutting)

 13. Added new method Token.setPositionIncrement().

     This permits, for the purpose of phrase searching, placing
     multiple terms in a single position.  This is useful with
     stemmers that produce multiple possible stems for a word.

     This also permits the introduction of gaps between terms, so that
     terms which are adjacent in a token stream will not be matched by
     and exact phrase query.  This makes it possible, e.g., to build
     an analyzer where phrases are not matched over stop words which
     have been removed.

     Finally, repeating a token with an increment of zero can also be
     used to boost scores of matches on that token.  (cutting)

 14. Added new Filter class, QueryFilter.  This constrains search
     results to only match those which also match a provided query.
     Results are cached, so that searches after the first on the same
     index using this filter are very fast.

     This could be used, for example, with a RangeQuery on a formatted
     date field to implement date filtering.  One could re-use a
     single QueryFilter that matches, e.g., only documents modified
     within the last week.  The QueryFilter and RangeQuery would only
     need to be reconstructed once per day. (cutting)

 15. Added a new IndexWriter method, getAnalyzer().  This returns the
     analyzer used when adding documents to this index. (cutting)

 16. Fixed a bug with IndexReader.lastModified().  Before, document
     deletion did not update this.  Now it does.  (cutting)

 17. Added Russian Analyzer.
     (Boris Okner via otis)

 18. Added a public, extensible scoring API.  For details, see the
     javadoc for org.apache.lucene.search.Similarity.

 19. Fixed return of Hits.id() from float to int. (Terry Steichen via Peter).

 20. Added getFieldNames() to IndexReader and Segment(s)Reader classes.
     (Peter Mularien via otis)

 21. Added getFields(String) and getValues(String) methods.
     Contributed by Rasik Pandey on 2002-10-09
     (Rasik Pandey via otis)

 22. Revised internal search APIs.  Changes include:

       a. Queries are no longer modified during a search.  This makes
       it possible, e.g., to reuse the same query instance with
       multiple indexes from multiple threads.

       b. Term-expanding queries (e.g. PrefixQuery, WildcardQuery,
       etc.)  now work correctly with MultiSearcher, fixing bugs 12619
       and 12667.

       c. Boosting BooleanQuery's now works, and is supported by the
       query parser (problem reported by Lee Mallabone).  Thus a query
       like "(+foo +bar)^2 +baz" is now supported and equivalent to
       "(+foo^2 +bar^2) +baz".

       d. New method: Query.rewrite(IndexReader).  This permits a
       query to re-write itself as an alternate, more primitive query.
       Most of the term-expanding query classes (PrefixQuery,
       WildcardQuery, etc.) are now implemented using this method.

       e. New method: Searchable.explain(Query q, int doc).  This
       returns an Explanation instance that describes how a particular
       document is scored against a query.  An explanation can be
       displayed as either plain text, with the toString() method, or
       as HTML, with the toHtml() method.  Note that computing an
       explanation is as expensive as executing the query over the
       entire index.  This is intended to be used in developing
       Similarity implementations, and, for good performance, should
       not be displayed with every hit.

       f. Scorer and Weight are public, not package protected.  It now
       possible for someone to write a Scorer implementation that is
       not in the org.apache.lucene.search package.  This is still
       fairly advanced programming, and I don't expect anyone to do
       this anytime soon, but at least now it is possible.

       g. Added public accessors to the primitive query classes
       (TermQuery, PhraseQuery and BooleanQuery), permitting access to
       their terms and clauses.

     Caution: These are extensive changes and they have not yet been
     tested extensively.  Bug reports are appreciated.
     (cutting)

 23. Added convenience RAMDirectory constructors taking File and String
     arguments, for easy FSDirectory to RAMDirectory conversion.
     (otis)

 24. Added code for manual renaming of files in FSDirectory, since it
     has been reported that java.io.File's renameTo(File) method sometimes
     fails on Windows JVMs.
     (Matt Tucker via otis)

 25. Refactored QueryParser to make it easier for people to extend it.
     Added the ability to automatically lower-case Wildcard terms in
     the QueryParser.
     (Tatu Saloranta via otis)


1.2 RC6

 1. Changed QueryParser.jj to have "?" be a special character which
    allowed it to be used as a wildcard term. Updated TestWildcard
    unit test also. (Ralf Hettesheimer via carlson)

1.2 RC5

 1. Renamed build.properties to default.properties and updated
    the BUILD.txt document to describe how to override the
    default.property settings without having to edit the file. This
    brings the build process closer to Scarab's build process.
    (jon)

 2. Added MultiFieldQueryParser class. (Kelvin Tan, via otis)

 3. Updated "powered by" links. (otis)

 4. Fixed instruction for setting up JavaCC - Bug #7017 (otis)

 5. Added throwing exception if FSDirectory could not create directory
    - Bug #6914 (Eugene Gluzberg via otis)

 6. Update MultiSearcher, MultiFieldParse, Constants, DateFilter,
    LowerCaseTokenizer javadoc (otis)

 7. Added fix to avoid NullPointerException in results.jsp
    (Mark Hayes via otis)

 8. Changed Wildcard search to find 0 or more char instead of 1 or more
    (Lee Mallobone, via otis)

 9. Fixed error in offset issue in GermanStemFilter - Bug #7412
    (Rodrigo Reyes, via otis)

 10. Added unit tests for wildcard search and DateFilter (otis)

 11. Allow co-existence of indexed and non-indexed fields with the same name
     (cutting/casper, via otis)

 12. Add escape character to query parser.
     (briangoetz)

 13. Applied a patch that ensures that searches that use DateFilter
     don't throw an exception when no matches are found. (David Smiley, via
     otis)

 14. Fixed bugs in DateFilter and wildcardquery unit tests. (cutting, otis, carlson)


1.2 RC4

 1. Updated contributions section of website.
    Add XML Document #3 implementation to Document Section.
    Also added Term Highlighting to Misc Section. (carlson)

 2. Fixed NullPointerException for phrase searches containing
    unindexed terms, introduced in 1.2RC3.  (cutting)

 3. Changed document deletion code to obtain the index write lock,
    enforcing the fact that document addition and deletion cannot be
    performed concurrently.  (cutting)

 4. Various documentation cleanups.  (otis, acoliver)

 5. Updated "powered by" links.  (cutting, jon)

 6. Fixed a bug in the GermanStemmer.  (Bernhard Messer, via otis)

 7. Changed Term and Query to implement Serializable.  (scottganyo)

 8. Fixed to never delete indexes added with IndexWriter.addIndexes().
    (cutting)

 9. Upgraded to JUnit 3.7. (otis)

1.2 RC3

 1. IndexWriter: fixed a bug where adding an optimized index to an
    empty index failed.  This was encountered using addIndexes to copy
    a RAMDirectory index to an FSDirectory.

 2. RAMDirectory: fixed a bug where RAMInputStream could not read
    across more than across a single buffer boundary.

 3. Fix query parser so it accepts queries with unicode characters.
    (briangoetz)

 4. Fix query parser so that PrefixQuery is used in preference to
    WildcardQuery when there's only an asterisk at the end of the
    term.  Previously PrefixQuery would never be used.

 5. Fix tests so they compile; fix ant file so it compiles tests
    properly.  Added test cases for Analyzers and PriorityQueue.

 6. Updated demos, added Getting Started documentation. (acoliver)

 7. Added 'contributions' section to website & docs. (carlson)

 8. Removed JavaCC from source distribution for copyright reasons.
    Folks must now download this separately from metamata in order to
    compile Lucene.  (cutting)

 9. Substantially improved the performance of DateFilter by adding the
    ability to reuse TermDocs objects.  (cutting)

10. Added IndexReader methods:
      public static boolean indexExists(String directory);
      public static boolean indexExists(File directory);
      public static boolean indexExists(Directory directory);
      public static boolean isLocked(Directory directory);
      public static void unlock(Directory directory);
    (cutting, otis)

11. Fixed bugs in GermanAnalyzer (gschwarz)


1.2 RC2
 - added sources to distribution

   include the nearest term in the index above a non-existant
   specified upper term.
 - SegmentTermEnum: Fix NullPointerException in clone() method
   when the Term is null.

  - misc bug fixes.

1.01b
 . last Sourceforge release
 . a few bug fixes
 . new Query Parser
 . new prefix query (search for "foo*" matches "food")

1.0

This release fixes a few serious bugs and also includes some
performance optimizations, a stemmer, and a few other minor
enhancements.

0.04

Lucene now includes a grammar-based tokenizer, StandardTokenizer.

The only tokenizer included in the previous release (LetterTokenizer)
identified terms consisting entirely of alphabetic characters.  The
new tokenizer uses a regular-expression grammar to identify more
complex classes of terms, including numbers, acronyms, email
addresses, etc.

StandardTokenizer serves two purposes:

 1. It is a much better, general purpose tokenizer for use by
    applications as is.

    The easiest way for applications to start using
    StandardTokenizer is to use StandardAnalyzer.

 2. It provides a good example of grammar-based tokenization.

    If an application has special tokenization requirements, it can
    implement a custom tokenizer by copying the directory containing
    the new tokenizer into the application and modifying it
    accordingly.

0.01

First open source release.

The code has been re-organized into a new package and directory
structure for this release.  It builds OK, but has not been tested
beyond that since the re-organization.
