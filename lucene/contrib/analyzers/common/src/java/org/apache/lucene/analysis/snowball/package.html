{@link org.apache.lucene.analysis.TokenFilter} and {@link
org.apache.lucene.analysis.Analyzer} implementations that use Snowball
stemmers.
<p>
This project provides pre-compiled version of the Snowball stemmers
based on revision 500 of the Tartarus Snowball repository,
together with classes integrating them with the Lucene search engine.
</p>
<p>
A few changes has been made to the static Snowball code and compiled stemmers:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Class SnowballProgram is made abstract and contains new abstract method stem() to avoid reflection in Lucene filter class SnowballFilter.</li>
  <li>All use of StringBuffers has been refactored to StringBuilder for speed.</li>
  <li>Snowball BSD license header has been added to the Java classes to avoid having RAT adding ASL headers.</li>
</ul>
<p>
See the Snowball <a href ="http://snowball.tartarus.org/">home page</a> for more information about the algorithms.
</p>

<p>
<b>IMPORTANT NOTICE ON BACKWARDS COMPATIBILITY!</b>
</p>
<p>
An index created using the Snowball module in Lucene 2.3.2 and below
might not be compatible with the Snowball module in Lucene 2.4 or greater.
</p>
