/**
 * TaxonomyReader is the read-only interface with which the faceted-search
 * library uses the taxonomy during search time.
 * <P>
 * A TaxonomyReader holds a list of categories. Each category has a serial
 * number which we call an "ordinal", and a hierarchical "path" name:
 * <UL>
 * <LI>
 * The ordinal is an integer that starts at 0 for the first category (which is
 * always the root category), and grows contiguously as more categories are
 * added; Note that once a category is added, it can never be deleted.
 * <LI>
 * The path is a CategoryPath object specifying the category's position in the
 * hierarchy.
 * </UL>
 * <B>Notes about concurrent access to the taxonomy:</B>
 * <P>
 * An implementation must allow multiple readers to be active concurrently
 * with a single writer. Readers follow so-called "point in time" semantics,
 * i.e., a TaxonomyReader object will only see taxonomy entries which were
 * available at the time it was created. What the writer writes is only
 * available to (new) readers after the writer's commit() is called.
 * <P>
 * In faceted search, two separate indices are used: the main Lucene index,
 * and the taxonomy. Because the main index refers to the categories listed
 * in the taxonomy, it is important to open the taxonomy *after* opening the
 * main index, and it is also necessary to reopen() the taxonomy after
 * reopen()ing the main index.
 * <P>
 * This order is important, otherwise it would be possible for the main index
 * to refer to a category which is not yet visible in the old snapshot of
 * the taxonomy. Note that it is indeed fine for the taxonomy to be opened
 * after the main index - even a long time after. The reason is that once
 * a category is added to the taxonomy, it can never be changed or deleted,
 * so there is no danger that a "too new" taxonomy not being consistent with
 * an older index.
