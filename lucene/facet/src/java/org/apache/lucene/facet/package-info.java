/**
 * Faceted search.
 *
 * <p>This module provides multiple methods for computing facet counts and value aggregations:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Taxonomy-based methods rely on a separate taxonomy index to map hierarchical facet paths to
 *       global int ordinals for fast counting at search time; these methods can compute counts
 *       (({@link org.apache.lucene.facet.taxonomy.FastTaxonomyFacetCounts}, {@link
 *       org.apache.lucene.facet.taxonomy.TaxonomyFacetCounts}) aggregate long or double values
 *       {@link org.apache.lucene.facet.taxonomy.TaxonomyFacetSumIntAssociations}, {@link
 *       org.apache.lucene.facet.taxonomy.TaxonomyFacetSumFloatAssociations}, {@link
 *       org.apache.lucene.facet.taxonomy.TaxonomyFacetSumValueSource}. Add {@link
 *       org.apache.lucene.facet.FacetField} or {@link
 *       org.apache.lucene.facet.taxonomy.AssociationFacetField} to your documents at index time to
 *       use taxonomy-based methods.
 *   <li>Sorted-set doc values method does not require a separate taxonomy index, and computes
 *       counts based on sorted set doc values fields ({@link
 *       org.apache.lucene.facet.sortedset.SortedSetDocValuesFacetCounts}). Add {@link
 *       org.apache.lucene.facet.sortedset.SortedSetDocValuesFacetField} to your documents at index
 *       time to use sorted set facet counts.
 *   <li>Range faceting {@link org.apache.lucene.facet.range.LongRangeFacetCounts}, {@link
 *       org.apache.lucene.facet.range.DoubleRangeFacetCounts} compute counts for a dynamic numeric
 *       range from a provided {@link org.apache.lucene.search.LongValuesSource} (previously indexed
 *       numeric field, or a dynamic expression such as distance).
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>At search time you first run your search, but pass a {@link
 * org.apache.lucene.facet.FacetsCollector} to gather all hits (and optionally, scores for each
 * hit). Then, instantiate whichever facet methods you'd like to use to compute aggregates. Finally,
 * all methods implement a common {@link org.apache.lucene.facet.Facets} base API that you use to
 * obtain specific facet counts.
 *
 * <p>The various {@link org.apache.lucene.facet.FacetsCollector#search} utility methods are useful
 * for doing an "ordinary" search (sorting by score, or by a specified Sort) but also collecting
 * into a {@link org.apache.lucene.facet.FacetsCollector} for subsequent faceting.
