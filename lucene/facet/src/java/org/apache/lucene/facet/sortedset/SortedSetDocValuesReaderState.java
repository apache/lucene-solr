/**
 * Wraps a {@link IndexReader} and resolves ords using existing {@link SortedSetDocValues} APIs
 * without a separate taxonomy index. This only supports flat facets (dimension + label), and it
 * makes faceting a bit slower, adds some cost at reopen time, but avoids managing the separate
 * taxonomy index. It also requires less RAM than the taxonomy index, as it manages the flat
 * (2-level) hierarchy more efficiently. In addition, the tie-break during faceting is now
 * meaningful (in label sorted order).
 *
 * <p><b>NOTE</b>: creating an instance of this class is somewhat costly, as it computes per-segment
 * ordinal maps, so you should create it once and re-use that one instance for a given {@link
 * IndexReader}.
