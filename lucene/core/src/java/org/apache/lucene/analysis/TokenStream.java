/**
 * A <code>TokenStream</code> enumerates the sequence of tokens, either from
 * {@link Field}s of a {@link Document} or from query text.
 * <p>
 * This is an abstract class; concrete subclasses are:
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link Tokenizer}, a <code>TokenStream</code> whose input is a Reader; and
 * <li>{@link TokenFilter}, a <code>TokenStream</code> whose input is another
 * <code>TokenStream</code>.
 * </ul>
 * A new <code>TokenStream</code> API has been introduced with Lucene 2.9. This API
 * has moved from being {@link Token}-based to {@link Attribute}-based. While
 * {@link Token} still exists in 2.9 as a convenience class, the preferred way
 * to store the information of a {@link Token} is to use {@link AttributeImpl}s.
 * <p>
 * <code>TokenStream</code> now extends {@link AttributeSource}, which provides
 * access to all of the token {@link Attribute}s for the <code>TokenStream</code>.
 * Note that only one instance per {@link AttributeImpl} is created and reused
 * for every token. This approach reduces object creation and allows local
 * caching of references to the {@link AttributeImpl}s. See
 * {@link #incrementToken()} for further details.
 * <p>
 * <b>The workflow of the new <code>TokenStream</code> API is as follows:</b>
 * <ol>
 * <li>Instantiation of <code>TokenStream</code>/{@link TokenFilter}s which add/get
 * attributes to/from the {@link AttributeSource}.
 * <li>The consumer calls {@link TokenStream#reset()}.
 * <li>The consumer retrieves attributes from the stream and stores local
 * references to all attributes it wants to access.
 * <li>The consumer calls {@link #incrementToken()} until it returns false
 * consuming the attributes after each call.
 * <li>The consumer calls {@link #end()} so that any end-of-stream operations
 * can be performed.
 * <li>The consumer calls {@link #close()} to release any resource when finished
 * using the <code>TokenStream</code>.
 * </ol>
 * To make sure that filters and consumers know which attributes are available,
 * the attributes must be added during instantiation. Filters and consumers are
 * not required to check for availability of attributes in
 * {@link #incrementToken()}.
 * <p>
 * You can find some example code for the new API in the analysis package level
 * Javadoc.
 * <p>
 * Sometimes it is desirable to capture a current state of a <code>TokenStream</code>,
 * e.g., for buffering purposes (see {@link CachingTokenFilter},
 * TeeSinkTokenFilter). For this usecase
 * {@link AttributeSource#captureState} and {@link AttributeSource#restoreState}
 * can be used.
 * <p>The {@code TokenStream}-API in Lucene is based on the decorator pattern.
 * Therefore all non-abstract subclasses must be final or have at least a final
 * implementation of {@link #incrementToken}! This is checked when Java
 * assertions are enabled.
