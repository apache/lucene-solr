 * <pre class="prettyprint">
 *   final TermToBytesRefAttribute termAtt = tokenStream.getAttribute(TermToBytesRefAttribute.class);
 *
 *   while (tokenStream.incrementToken() {
 *     final BytesRef bytes = termAtt.getBytesRef();

 *       // you should make a copy if you need persistent access to the bytes, otherwise they will
 *       // be rewritten across calls to incrementToken()
 *
 *       doSomethingWith(BytesRef.deepCopyOf(bytes));

 * {@link CharTermAttribute} and its implementation for UTF-8 terms; to
 * index binary terms, use {@link BytesTermAttribute} and its implementation.
