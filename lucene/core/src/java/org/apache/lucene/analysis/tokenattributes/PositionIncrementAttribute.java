/** Determines the position of this token
 * relative to the previous Token in a TokenStream, used in phrase
 * searching.
 *
 * <p>The default value is one.
 *
 * <p>Some common uses for this are:<ul>
 *
 * <li>Set it to zero to put multiple terms in the same position.  This is
 * useful if, e.g., a word has multiple stems.  Searches for phrases
 * including either stem will match.  In this case, all but the first stem's
 * increment should be set to zero: the increment of the first instance
 * should be one.  Repeating a token with an increment of zero can also be
 * used to boost the scores of matches on that token.
 *
 * <li>Set it to values greater than one to inhibit exact phrase matches.
 * If, for example, one does not want phrases to match across removed stop
 * words, then one could build a stop word filter that removes stop words and
 * also sets the increment to the number of stop words removed before each
 * non-stop word.  Then exact phrase queries will only match when the terms
 * occur with no intervening stop words.
 *
 * </ul>
