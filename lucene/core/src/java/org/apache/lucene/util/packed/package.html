<h2>Packed integer arrays and streams.</h2>

<p>
    The packed package provides
    <ul>
    	<li>sequential and random access capable arrays of positive longs,</li>
    	<li>routines for efficient serialization and deserialization of streams of packed integers.</li>
    </ul>

    The implementations provide different trade-offs between memory usage and
    access speed. The standard usage scenario is replacing large int or long
    arrays in order to reduce the memory footprint.
</p><p>
    The main access point is the {@link org.apache.lucene.util.packed.PackedInts} factory.
</p>

<h3>In-memory structures</h3>

<ul>
    <li><b>{@link org.apache.lucene.util.packed.PackedInts.Mutable}</b><ul>
        <li>Only supports positive longs.</li>
        <li>Requires the number of bits per value to be known in advance.</li>
        <li>Random-access for both writing and reading.</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li><b>{@link org.apache.lucene.util.packed.GrowableWriter}</b><ul>
        <li>Same as PackedInts.Mutable but grows the number of bits per values when needed.</li>
        <li>Useful to build a PackedInts.Mutable from a read-once stream of longs.</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li><b>{@link org.apache.lucene.util.packed.AppendingLongBuffer}</b><ul>
        <li>Can store any sequence of longs.</li>
        <li>Compression is good when values are close to each other.</li>
        <li>Supports random reads, but only sequential writes.</li>
        <li>Can address up to 2^42 values.</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li><b>{@link org.apache.lucene.util.packed.MonotonicAppendingLongBuffer}</b><ul>
        <li>Same as AppendingLongBuffer except that compression is good when the stream is a succession of affine functions.</li>
    </ul></li>
</ul>

<h3>Disk-based structures</h3>

<ul>
    <li><b>{@link org.apache.lucene.util.packed.PackedInts.Writer}, {@link org.apache.lucene.util.packed.PackedInts.Reader}, {@link org.apache.lucene.util.packed.PackedInts.ReaderIterator}</b><ul>
        <li>Only supports positive longs.</li>
        <li>Requires the number of bits per value to be known in advance.</li>
        <li>Supports both fast sequential access with low memory footprint with ReaderIterator and random-access by either loading values in memory or leaving them on disk with Reader.</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li><b>{@link org.apache.lucene.util.packed.BlockPackedWriter}, {@link org.apache.lucene.util.packed.BlockPackedReader}, {@link org.apache.lucene.util.packed.BlockPackedReaderIterator}</b><ul>
        <li>Splits the stream into fixed-size blocks.</li>
        <li>Compression is good when values are close to each other.</li>
        <li>Can address up to 2B * blockSize values.</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li><b>{@link org.apache.lucene.util.packed.MonotonicBlockPackedWriter}, {@link org.apache.lucene.util.packed.MonotonicBlockPackedReader}</b><ul>
        <li>Same as the non-monotonic variants except that compression is good when the stream is a succession of affine functions.</li>
        <li>The reason why there is no sequential access is that if you need sequential access, you should rather delta-encode and use BlockPackedWriter.</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li><b>{@link org.apache.lucene.util.packed.PackedDataOutput}, {@link org.apache.lucene.util.packed.PackedDataInput}</b><ul>
        <li>Writes sequences of longs where each long can use any number of bits.</li>
    </ul></li>
</ul>
