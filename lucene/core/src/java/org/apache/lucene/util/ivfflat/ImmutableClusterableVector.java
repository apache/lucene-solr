   * Compares this object with the specified object for order.  Returns a

   * than, equal to, or greater than the specified object.
   *
   * <p>The implementor must ensure
   * {@code sgn(x.compareTo(y)) == -sgn(y.compareTo(x))}
   * for all {@code x} and {@code y}.  (This
   * implies that {@code x.compareTo(y)} must throw an exception iff
   * {@code y.compareTo(x)} throws an exception.)
   *
   * <p>The implementor must also ensure that the relation is transitive:
   * {@code (x.compareTo(y) > 0 && y.compareTo(z) > 0)} implies
   * {@code x.compareTo(z) > 0}.
   *
   * <p>Finally, the implementor must ensure that {@code x.compareTo(y)==0}
   * implies that {@code sgn(x.compareTo(z)) == sgn(y.compareTo(z))}, for
   * all {@code z}.
   *
   * <p>It is strongly recommended, but <i>not</i> strictly required that
   * {@code (x.compareTo(y)==0) == (x.equals(y))}.  Generally speaking, any
   * class that implements the {@code Comparable} interface and violates
   * this condition should clearly indicate this fact.  The recommended
   * language is "Note: this class has a natural ordering that is
   * inconsistent with equals."
   *
   * <p>In the foregoing description, the notation
   * {@code sgn(}<i>expression</i>{@code )} designates the mathematical
   * <i>signum</i> function, which is defined to return one of {@code -1},
   * {@code 0}, or {@code 1} according to whether the value of
   * <i>expression</i> is negative, zero, or positive, respectively.
   *
   * @param o the object to be compared.
   * @return a negative integer, zero, or a positive integer as this object
   * is less than, equal to, or greater than the specified object.
   * @throws NullPointerException if the specified object is null
   * @throws ClassCastException   if the specified object's type prevents it
   *                              from being compared to this object.
