/**
 * <p>Implements {@link LockFactory} using native OS file
 * locks.  Note that because this LockFactory relies on
 * java.nio.* APIs for locking, any problems with those APIs
 * will cause locking to fail.  Specifically, on certain NFS
 * environments the java.nio.* locks will fail (the lock can
 * incorrectly be double acquired) whereas {@link
 * SimpleFSLockFactory} worked perfectly in those same
 * environments.  For NFS based access to an index, it's
 * recommended that you try {@link SimpleFSLockFactory}
 * first and work around the one limitation that a lock file
 * could be left when the JVM exits abnormally.</p>
 *
 * <p>The primary benefit of {@link NativeFSLockFactory} is
 * that locks (not the lock file itsself) will be properly
 * removed (by the OS) if the JVM has an abnormal exit.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Note that, unlike {@link SimpleFSLockFactory}, the existence of
 * leftover lock files in the filesystem is fine because the OS
 * will free the locks held against these files even though the
 * files still remain. Lucene will never actively remove the lock
 * files, so although you see them, the index may not be locked.</p>
 *
 * <p>Special care needs to be taken if you change the locking
 * implementation: First be certain that no writer is in fact
 * writing to the index otherwise you can easily corrupt
 * your index. Be sure to do the LockFactory change on all Lucene
 * instances and clean up all leftover lock files before starting
 * the new configuration for the first time. Different implementations
 * can not work together!</p>
 *
 * <p>If you suspect that this or any other LockFactory is
 * not working properly in your environment, you can easily
 * test it by using {@link VerifyingLockFactory}, {@link
 * LockVerifyServer} and {@link LockStressTest}.</p>
 * 
 * <p>This is a singleton, you have to use {@link #INSTANCE}.
