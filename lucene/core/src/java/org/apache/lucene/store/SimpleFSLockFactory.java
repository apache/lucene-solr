/**
 * <p>Implements {@link LockFactory} using {@link
 * File#createNewFile()}.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>NOTE:</b> the <a target="_top"
 * href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/java/io/File.html#createNewFile()">javadocs
 * for <code>File.createNewFile</code></a> contain a vague
 * yet spooky warning about not using the API for file
 * locking.  This warning was added due to <a target="_top"
 * href="http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=4676183">this
 * bug</a>, and in fact the only known problem with using
 * this API for locking is that the Lucene write lock may
 * not be released when the JVM exits abnormally.</p>

 * <p>When this happens, a {@link LockObtainFailedException}
 * is hit when trying to create a writer, in which case you
 * need to explicitly clear the lock file first.  You can
 * either manually remove the file, or use the {@link
 * org.apache.lucene.index.IndexWriter#unlock(Directory)}
 * API.  But, first be certain that no writer is in fact
 * writing to the index otherwise you can easily corrupt
 * your index.</p>
 *
 * <p>If you suspect that this or any other LockFactory is
 * not working properly in your environment, you can easily
 * test it by using {@link VerifyingLockFactory}, {@link
 * LockVerifyServer} and {@link LockStressTest}.</p>
