/**
 * <p>Implements {@link LockFactory} using {@link
 * Files#createFile}.</p>
 *
 * <p>The main downside with using this API for locking is 
 * that the Lucene write lock may not be released when 
 * the JVM exits abnormally.</p>
 *
 * <p>When this happens, an {@link LockObtainFailedException}
 * is hit when trying to create a writer, in which case you may
 * need to explicitly clear the lock file first by
 * manually removing the file.  But, first be certain that
 * no writer is in fact writing to the index otherwise you
 * can easily corrupt your index.</p>
 *
 * <p>Special care needs to be taken if you change the locking
 * implementation: First be certain that no writer is in fact
 * writing to the index otherwise you can easily corrupt
 * your index. Be sure to do the LockFactory change all Lucene
 * instances and clean up all leftover lock files before starting
 * the new configuration for the first time. Different implementations
 * can not work together!</p>
 *
 * <p>If you suspect that this or any other LockFactory is
 * not working properly in your environment, you can easily
 * test it by using {@link VerifyingLockFactory}, {@link
 * LockVerifyServer} and {@link LockStressTest}.</p>
 * 
 * <p>This is a singleton, you have to use {@link #INSTANCE}.
