/**
 * Base class for Directory implementations that store index
 * files in the file system.  
 * <a name="subclasses"></a>
 * There are currently three core
 * subclasses:
 *
 * <ul>
 *
 *  <li>{@link SimpleFSDirectory} is a straightforward
 *       implementation using Files.newByteChannel.
 *       However, it has poor concurrent performance
 *       (multiple threads will bottleneck) as it
 *       synchronizes when multiple threads read from the
 *       same file.
 *
 *  <li>{@link NIOFSDirectory} uses java.nio's
 *       FileChannel's positional io when reading to avoid
 *       synchronization when reading from the same file.
 *       Unfortunately, due to a Windows-only <a
 *       href="http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=6265734">Sun
 *       JRE bug</a> this is a poor choice for Windows, but
 *       on all other platforms this is the preferred
 *       choice. Applications using {@link Thread#interrupt()} or
 *       {@link Future#cancel(boolean)} should use
 *       {@code RAFDirectory} instead. See {@link NIOFSDirectory} java doc
 *       for details.
 *        
 *  <li>{@link MMapDirectory} uses memory-mapped IO when
 *       reading. This is a good choice if you have plenty
 *       of virtual memory relative to your index size, eg
 *       if you are running on a 64 bit JRE, or you are
 *       running on a 32 bit JRE but your index sizes are
 *       small enough to fit into the virtual memory space.
 *       Java has currently the limitation of not being able to
 *       unmap files from user code. The files are unmapped, when GC
 *       releases the byte buffers. Due to
 *       <a href="http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=4724038">
 *       this bug</a> in Sun's JRE, MMapDirectory's {@link IndexInput#close}
 *       is unable to close the underlying OS file handle. Only when
 *       GC finally collects the underlying objects, which could be
 *       quite some time later, will the file handle be closed.
 *       This will consume additional transient disk usage: on Windows,
 *       attempts to delete or overwrite the files will result in an
 *       exception; on other platforms, which typically have a &quot;delete on
 *       last close&quot; semantics, while such operations will succeed, the bytes
 *       are still consuming space on disk.  For many applications this
 *       limitation is not a problem (e.g. if you have plenty of disk space,
 *       and you don't rely on overwriting files on Windows) but it's still
 *       an important limitation to be aware of. This class supplies a
 *       (possibly dangerous) workaround mentioned in the bug report,
 *       which may fail on non-Sun JVMs.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Unfortunately, because of system peculiarities, there is
 * no single overall best implementation.  Therefore, we've
 * added the {@link #open} method, to allow Lucene to choose
 * the best FSDirectory implementation given your
 * environment, and the known limitations of each
 * implementation.  For users who have no reason to prefer a
 * specific implementation, it's best to simply use {@link
 * #open}.  For all others, you should instantiate the
 * desired implementation directly.
 *
 * <p><b>NOTE:</b> Accessing one of the above subclasses either directly or
 * indirectly from a thread while it's interrupted can close the
 * underlying channel immediately if at the same time the thread is
 * blocked on IO. The channel will remain closed and subsequent access
 * to the index will throw a {@link ClosedChannelException}.
 * Applications using {@link Thread#interrupt()} or
 * {@link Future#cancel(boolean)} should use the slower legacy
 * {@code RAFDirectory} from the {@code misc} Lucene module instead.
 *
 * <p>The locking implementation is by default {@link
 * NativeFSLockFactory}, but can be changed by
 * passing in a custom {@link LockFactory} instance.
 *
