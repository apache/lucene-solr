/**
 * Keeps track of current plus old IndexSearchers, closing
 * the old ones once they have timed out.
 *
 * Use it like this:
 *
 * <pre class="prettyprint">
 *   SearcherLifetimeManager mgr = new SearcherLifetimeManager();
 * </pre>
 *
 * Per search-request, if it's a "new" search request, then
 * obtain the latest searcher you have (for example, by
 * using {@link SearcherManager}), and then record this
 * searcher:
 *
 * <pre class="prettyprint">
 *   // Record the current searcher, and save the returend
 *   // token into user's search results (eg as a  hidden
 *   // HTML form field):
 *   long token = mgr.record(searcher);
 * </pre>
 *
 * When a follow-up search arrives, for example the user
 * clicks next page, drills down/up, etc., take the token
 * that you saved from the previous search and:
 *
 * <pre class="prettyprint">
 *   // If possible, obtain the same searcher as the last
 *   // search:
 *   IndexSearcher searcher = mgr.acquire(token);
 *   if (searcher != null) {
 *     // Searcher is still here
 *     try {
 *       // do searching...
 *     } finally {
 *       mgr.release(searcher);
 *       // Do not use searcher after this!
 *       searcher = null;
 *     }
 *   } else {
 *     // Searcher was pruned -- notify user session timed
 *     // out, or, pull fresh searcher again
 *   }
 * </pre>
 *
 * Finally, in a separate thread, ideally the same thread
 * that's periodically reopening your searchers, you should
 * periodically prune old searchers:
 *
 * <pre class="prettyprint">
 *   mgr.prune(new PruneByAge(600.0));
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p><b>NOTE</b>: keeping many searchers around means
 * you'll use more resources (open files, RAM) than a single
 * searcher.  However, as long as you are using {@link
 * DirectoryReader#openIfChanged(DirectoryReader)}, the searchers
 * will usually share almost all segments and the added resource usage
 * is contained.  When a large merge has completed, and
 * you reopen, because that is a large change, the new
 * searcher will use higher additional RAM than other
 * searchers; but large merges don't complete very often and
 * it's unlikely you'll hit two of them in your expiration
 * window.  Still you should budget plenty of heap in the
 * JVM to have a good safety margin.
