/**
 * The calculus of spans.
 *
 * <p>A span is a <code>&lt;doc,startPosition,endPosition&gt;</code> tuple that is enumerated by
 * class {@link org.apache.lucene.search.spans.Spans Spans}.
 *
 * <p>The following span query operators are implemented:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>A {@link org.apache.lucene.search.spans.SpanTermQuery SpanTermQuery} matches all spans
 *       containing a particular {@link org.apache.lucene.index.Term Term}. This should not be used
 *       for terms that are indexed at position Integer.MAX_VALUE.
 *   <li>A {@link org.apache.lucene.search.spans.SpanNearQuery SpanNearQuery} matches spans which
 *       occur near one another, and can be used to implement things like phrase search (when
 *       constructed from {@link org.apache.lucene.search.spans.SpanTermQuery}s) and inter-phrase
 *       proximity (when constructed from other {@link
 *       org.apache.lucene.search.spans.SpanNearQuery}s).
 *   <li>A {@link org.apache.lucene.search.spans.SpanWithinQuery SpanWithinQuery} matches spans
 *       which occur inside of another spans.
 *   <li>A {@link org.apache.lucene.search.spans.SpanContainingQuery SpanContainingQuery} matches
 *       spans which contain another spans.
 *   <li>A {@link org.apache.lucene.search.spans.SpanOrQuery SpanOrQuery} merges spans from a number
 *       of other {@link org.apache.lucene.search.spans.SpanQuery}s.
 *   <li>A {@link org.apache.lucene.search.spans.SpanNotQuery SpanNotQuery} removes spans matching
 *       one {@link org.apache.lucene.search.spans.SpanQuery SpanQuery} which overlap (or comes
 *       near) another. This can be used, e.g., to implement within-paragraph search.
 *   <li>A {@link org.apache.lucene.search.spans.SpanFirstQuery SpanFirstQuery} matches spans
 *       matching <code>q</code> whose end position is less than <code>n</code>. This can be used to
 *       constrain matches to the first part of the document.
 *   <li>A {@link org.apache.lucene.search.spans.SpanPositionRangeQuery SpanPositionRangeQuery} is a
 *       more general form of SpanFirstQuery that can constrain matches to arbitrary portions of the
 *       document.
 * </ul>
 *
 * In all cases, output spans are minimally inclusive. In other words, a span formed by matching a
 * span in x and y starts at the lesser of the two starts and ends at the greater of the two ends.
 *
 * <p>For example, a span query which matches "John Kerry" within ten words of "George Bush" within
 * the first 100 words of the document could be constructed with:
 *
 * <pre class="prettyprint">
 * SpanQuery john   = new SpanTermQuery(new Term("content", "john"));
 * SpanQuery kerry  = new SpanTermQuery(new Term("content", "kerry"));
 * SpanQuery george = new SpanTermQuery(new Term("content", "george"));
 * SpanQuery bush   = new SpanTermQuery(new Term("content", "bush"));
 *
 * SpanQuery johnKerry =
 *    new SpanNearQuery(new SpanQuery[] {john, kerry}, 0, true);
 *
 * SpanQuery georgeBush =
 *    new SpanNearQuery(new SpanQuery[] {george, bush}, 0, true);
 *
 * SpanQuery johnKerryNearGeorgeBush =
 *    new SpanNearQuery(new SpanQuery[] {johnKerry, georgeBush}, 10, false);
 *
 * SpanQuery johnKerryNearGeorgeBushAtStart =
 *    new SpanFirstQuery(johnKerryNearGeorgeBush, 100);
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>Span queries may be freely intermixed with other Lucene queries. So, for example, the above
 * query can be restricted to documents which also use the word "iraq" with:
 *
 * <pre class="prettyprint">
 * Query query = new BooleanQuery();
 * query.add(johnKerryNearGeorgeBushAtStart, true, false);
 * query.add(new TermQuery("content", "iraq"), true, false);
 * </pre>
