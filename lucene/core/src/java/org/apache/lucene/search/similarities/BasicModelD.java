/**
 * Implements the approximation of the binomial model with the divergence
 * for DFR. The formula used in Lucene differs slightly from the one in the
 * original paper: to avoid underflow for small values of {@code N} and
 * {@code F}, {@code N} is increased by {@code 1} and
 * {@code F} is always increased by {@code tfn+1}.
 * <p>
 * WARNING: for terms that do not meet the expected random distribution
 * (e.g. stopwords), this model may give poor performance, such as
 * abnormally high or NaN scores for low tf values.
