/**
 * Expert: Default scoring implementation which {@link #encodeNormValue(float)
 * encodes} norm values as a single byte before being stored. At search time,
 * the norm byte value is read from the index
 * {@link org.apache.lucene.store.Directory directory} and
 * {@link #decodeNormValue(long) decoded} back to a float <i>norm</i> value.
 * This encoding/decoding, while reducing index size, comes with the price of
 * precision loss - it is not guaranteed that <i>decode(encode(x)) = x</i>. For
 * instance, <i>decode(encode(0.89)) = 0.875</i>.
 * <p>
 * Compression of norm values to a single byte saves memory at search time,
 * because once a field is referenced at search time, its norms - for all
 * documents - are maintained in memory.
 * <p>
 * The rationale supporting such lossy compression of norm values is that given
 * the difficulty (and inaccuracy) of users to express their true information
 * need by a query, only big differences matter. <br>
 * &nbsp;<br>
 * Last, note that search time is too late to modify this <i>norm</i> part of
 * scoring, e.g. by using a different {@link Similarity} for search.
