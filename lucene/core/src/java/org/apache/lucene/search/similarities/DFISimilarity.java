/**
 * Implements the <em>Divergence from Independence (DFI)</em> model based on Chi-square statistics
 * (i.e., standardized Chi-squared distance from independence in term frequency tf).
 * <p>
 * DFI is both parameter-free and non-parametric:
 * <ul>
 * <li>parameter-free: it does not require any parameter tuning or training.</li>
 * <li>non-parametric: it does not make any assumptions about word frequency distributions on document collections.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * It is highly recommended <b>not</b> to remove stopwords (very common terms: the, of, and, to, a, in, for, is, on, that, etc) with this similarity.
 * <p>
 * For more information see: <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10791-013-9225-4">A nonparametric term weighting method for information retrieval based on measuring the divergence from independence</a>
