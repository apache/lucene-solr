<h2>Interval Iterators</h2>
<p>
Lucene offers extensive query and scoring flexibility including boolean queries, specialized phrase queries, wildcards and many more. The intervals package aims
to provide a common interface to Lucene's proximity features available on all core queries. The central class in this package is
{@link org.apache.lucene.search.intervals.IntervalIterator IntervalIterator}, which allows iterative consumption of term positions and offsets on complex queries.
{@link org.apache.lucene.search.Scorer Scorer} exposes direct access to the queries' {@link org.apache.lucene.search.intervals.IntervalIterator IntervalIterator} reflecting a logical view
of the scorer on positions and offsets for each matching document.</p>
<p>
Intervals are entirely detached from scoring/matching documents and have no effect on query performance if proximity information or offsets are not needed or consumed. Its lazy nature requires
the user to specify the need for positions/offsets at scorer creation time per segment allowing for a large number of usecases:

<ul>
<li>Proximity matching without scoring ie. if token positions are needed for filtering out documents but the actual query score should not be modified</li>
<li>Second pass scoring ie. for high-performance proximity queries common practice is to re-score the top N (usually a large N) results of a non-proximity query with proximity information to improve precision.</li>
<li>Collecting an exhaustive list of intervals per query ie. complex queries might be interested in actual term positions across the entire query tree</li>
<li>Highlighting queries without re-analyzing the document or storing term vectors if offsets are stored in the index. Especially large documents will see a tremendous performance and space-consumption improvement over term-vectors / re-analyzing</li>
<li>Specializing queries for exotic proximity operators based on core queries</li>
</ul>

<h2>Core Iterators and Queries</h2>

The intervals package provides a basic set of {@link org.apache.lucene.search.intervals.IntervalIterator IntervalIterator} and {@link org.apache.lucene.search.Query Query} implementation 
based on minimum interval semantics, as defined in
<a href="http://vigna.dsi.unimi.it/ftp/papers/EfficientAlgorithmsMinimalIntervalSemantics">"Efficient Optimally Lazy Algorithms for Minimal-Interval Semantics</a>
<p>
  The following {@link org.apache.lucene.search.intervals.IntervalIterator IntervalIterator} implementations are provided:
  <ol>
    <li>{@link org.apache.lucene.search.intervals.BlockIntervalIterator - BlockIntervalIterator} -- an iterator providing an ordered <i>phrasal operator</i> with given gaps between sub-iterators</li>
    <li>{@link org.apache.lucene.search.intervals.OrderedConjunctionIntervalIterator - OrderedConjunctionIntervalIterator} -- an iterator providing an <i>ordered non-overlapping conjunction operator</i></li>
    <li>{@link org.apache.lucene.search.intervals.ConjunctionIntervalIterator - ConjunctionIntervalIterator} -- an iterator providing a <i>unordered conjunction operator</i></li>
    <li>{@link org.apache.lucene.search.intervals.BrouwerianIntervalIterator - BrouwerianIntervalIterator} -- an iterator computing the non-overlapping difference between two iterators</li>
    <li>{@link org.apache.lucene.search.intervals.DisjunctionIntervalIterator - DisjunctionIntervalIterator} -- an iterator providing a <i>unordered disjunction operator</i></li>
  </ol>
  All queries require positions to be stored in the index.
</p>

<p>
  The following Query implementations are provided:
  <ol>
    <li>{@link org.apache.lucene.search.intervals.IntervalFilterQuery - IntervalFilterQuery} -- Filters a Query based on the positions or ranges of its component parts</li>
    <li>{@link org.apache.lucene.search.intervals.OrderedNearQuery - OrderedNearQuery} -- Filters queries based on the ordered difference between their match positions in a document</li>
    <li>{@link org.apache.lucene.search.intervals.UnorderedNearQuery - UnorderedNearQuery} -- Filters queries based on the unordered difference between their match positions in a document</li>
    <li>{@link org.apache.lucene.search.intervals.NonOverlappingQuery - NonOverlappingQuery} -- Filters out queries with overlapping match positions</li>
  </ol>
  All queries require positions to be stored in the index.
