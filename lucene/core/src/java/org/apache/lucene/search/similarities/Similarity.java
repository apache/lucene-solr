/** 
 * Similarity defines the components of Lucene scoring.
 * <p>
 * Expert: Scoring API.
 * <p>
 * This is a low-level API, you should only extend this API if you want to implement 
 * an information retrieval <i>model</i>.  If you are instead looking for a convenient way 
 * to alter Lucene's scoring, consider extending a higher-level implementation
 * such as {@link TFIDFSimilarity}, which implements the vector space model with this API, or 
 * just tweaking the default implementation: {@link BM25Similarity}.
 * <p>
 * Similarity determines how Lucene weights terms, and Lucene interacts with
 * this class at both <a href="#indextime">index-time</a> and 
 * <a href="#querytime">query-time</a>.
 * <p>
 * <a name="indextime">Indexing Time</a>
 * At indexing time, the indexer calls {@link #computeNorm(FieldInvertState)}, allowing
 * the Similarity implementation to set a per-document value for the field that will 
 * be later accessible via {@link org.apache.lucene.index.LeafReader#getNormValues(String)}.  Lucene makes no assumption
 * about what is in this norm, but it is most useful for encoding length normalization 
 * information.
 * <p>
 * Implementations should carefully consider how the normalization is encoded: while
 * Lucene's {@link BM25Similarity} encodes a combination of index-time boost
 * and length normalization information with {@link SmallFloat} into a single byte, this 
 * might not be suitable for all purposes.
 * <p>
 * Many formulas require the use of average document length, which can be computed via a 
 * combination of {@link CollectionStatistics#sumTotalTermFreq()} and 
 * {@link CollectionStatistics#maxDoc()} or {@link CollectionStatistics#docCount()}, 
 * depending upon whether the average should reflect field sparsity.
 * <p>
 * Additional scoring factors can be stored in named
 * <code>NumericDocValuesField</code>s and accessed
 * at query-time with {@link org.apache.lucene.index.LeafReader#getNumericDocValues(String)}.
 * <p>
 * Finally, using index-time boosts (either via folding into the normalization byte or
 * via DocValues), is an inefficient way to boost the scores of different fields if the
 * boost will be the same for every document, instead the Similarity can simply take a constant
 * boost parameter <i>C</i>, and {@link PerFieldSimilarityWrapper} can return different 
 * instances with different boosts depending upon field name.
 * <p>
 * <a name="querytime">Query time</a>
 * At query-time, Queries interact with the Similarity via these steps:
 * <ol>
 *   <li>The {@link #computeWeight(float, CollectionStatistics, TermStatistics...)} method is called a single time,
 *       allowing the implementation to compute any statistics (such as IDF, average document length, etc)
 *       across <i>the entire collection</i>. The {@link TermStatistics} and {@link CollectionStatistics} passed in 
 *       already contain all of the raw statistics involved, so a Similarity can freely use any combination
 *       of statistics without causing any additional I/O. Lucene makes no assumption about what is 
 *       stored in the returned {@link Similarity.SimWeight} object.
 *   <li>For each segment in the index, the Query creates a {@link #simScorer(SimWeight, org.apache.lucene.index.LeafReaderContext)}
 *       The score() method is called for each matching document.
 * </ol>
 * <p>
 * <a name="explaintime">Explanations</a>
 * When {@link IndexSearcher#explain(org.apache.lucene.search.Query, int)} is called, queries consult the Similarity's DocScorer for an 
 * explanation of how it computed its score. The query passes in a the document id and an explanation of how the frequency
 * was computed.
 *
