/**
 * <p>Expert: policy for deletion of stale {@link IndexCommit index commits}. 
 * 
 * <p>Implement this interface, and pass it to one
 * of the {@link IndexWriter} or {@link IndexReader}
 * constructors, to customize when older
 * {@link IndexCommit point-in-time commits}
 * are deleted from the index directory.  The default deletion policy
 * is {@link KeepOnlyLastCommitDeletionPolicy}, which always
 * removes old commits as soon as a new commit is done (this
 * matches the behavior before 2.2).</p>
 *
 * <p>One expected use case for this (and the reason why it
 * was first created) is to work around problems with an
 * index directory accessed via filesystems like NFS because
 * NFS does not provide the "delete on last close" semantics
 * that Lucene's "point in time" search normally relies on.
 * By implementing a custom deletion policy, such as "a
 * commit is only removed once it has been stale for more
 * than X minutes", you can give your readers time to
 * refresh to the new commit before {@link IndexWriter}
 * removes the old commits.  Note that doing so will
 * increase the storage requirements of the index.  See <a
 * target="top"
 * href="http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-710">LUCENE-710</a>
 * for details.</p>
 *
 * <p>Implementers of sub-classes should make sure that {@link #clone()}
 * returns an independent instance able to work with any other {@link IndexWriter}
 * or {@link Directory} instance.</p>
