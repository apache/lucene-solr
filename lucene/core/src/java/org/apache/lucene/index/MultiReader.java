/** A {@link CompositeReader} which reads multiple indexes, appending

 * <p> For efficiency, in this API documents are often referred to via
 * <i>document numbers</i>, non-negative integers which each name a unique
 * document in the index.  These document numbers are ephemeral -- they may change
 * as documents are added to and deleted from an index.  Clients should thus not
 * rely on a given document having the same number between sessions.

 * synchronization, you should <b>not</b> synchronize on the
 * <code>IndexReader</code> instance; use your own
 * (non-Lucene) objects instead.
