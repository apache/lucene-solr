/**
 Instances of this reader type can only
 be used to get stored fields from the underlying LeafReaders,
 but it is not possible to directly retrieve postings. To do that, get
 the {@link LeafReaderContext} for all sub-readers via {@link #leaves()}.
 Alternatively, you can mimic an {@link LeafReader} (with a serious slowdown),
 by wrapping composite readers with {@link SlowCompositeReaderWrapper}.
 
 <p>IndexReader instances for indexes on disk are usually constructed
 with a call to one of the static <code>DirectoryReader.open()</code> methods,
 e.g. {@link DirectoryReader#open(Directory)}. {@link DirectoryReader} implements
 the {@code CompositeReader} interface, it is not possible to directly get postings.
 <p> Concrete subclasses of IndexReader are usually constructed with a call to
 one of the static <code>open()</code> methods, e.g. {@link
 DirectoryReader#open(Directory)}.

 <p> For efficiency, in this API documents are often referred to via
 <i>document numbers</i>, non-negative integers which each name a unique
 document in the index.  These document numbers are ephemeral -- they may change
 as documents are added to and deleted from an index.  Clients should thus not
 rely on a given document having the same number between sessions.

 <p>
 <a name="thread-safety"></a><p><b>NOTE</b>: {@link
 IndexReader} instances are completely thread
 safe, meaning multiple threads can call any of its methods,
 concurrently.  If your application requires external
 synchronization, you should <b>not</b> synchronize on the
 <code>IndexReader</code> instance; use your own
 (non-Lucene) objects instead.
