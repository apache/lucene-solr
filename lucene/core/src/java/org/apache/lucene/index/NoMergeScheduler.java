 * A {@link MergeScheduler} which never executes any merges. It is also a singleton and can be
 * accessed through {@link NoMergeScheduler#INSTANCE}. Use it if you want to prevent an {@link

 * you can achieve the same thing by using {@link NoMergePolicy}, however with {@link
 * NoMergeScheduler} you also ensure that no unnecessary code of any {@link MergeScheduler}
 * implementation is ever executed. Hence it is recommended to use both if you want to disable
