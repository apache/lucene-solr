/**
 * Lucene 8.0 DocValues format.
 * <p>
 * Documents that have a value for the field are encoded in a way that it is always possible to
 * know the ordinal of the current document in the set of documents that have a value. For instance,
 * say the set of documents that have a value for the field is <tt>{1, 5, 6, 11}</tt>. When the
 * iterator is on <tt>6</tt>, it knows that this is the 3rd item of the set. This way, values can
 * be stored densely and accessed based on their index at search time. If all documents in a segment
 * have a value for the field, the index is the same as the doc ID, so this case is encoded implicitly
 * and is very fast at query time. On the other hand if some documents are missing a value for the
 * field then the set of documents that have a value is encoded into blocks. All doc IDs that share
 * the same upper 16 bits are encoded into the same block with the following strategies:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>SPARSE: This strategy is used when a block contains at most 4095 documents. The lower 16
 *         bits of doc IDs are stored as {@link DataOutput#writeShort(short) shorts} while the upper
 *         16 bits are given by the block ID.
 *     <li>DENSE: This strategy is used when a block contains between 4096 and 65535 documents. The
 *         lower bits of doc IDs are stored in a bit set. Advancing &lt; 512 documents is performed using
 *         {@link Long#numberOfTrailingZeros(long) ntz} operations while the index is computed by
 *         accumulating the {@link Long#bitCount(long) bit counts} of the visited longs.
 *         Advancing &gt;= 512 documents is performed by skipping to the start of the needed 512 document
 *         sub-block and iterating to the specific document within that block. The index for the
 *         sub-block that is skipped to is retrieved from a rank-table positioned beforethe bit set.
 *         The rank-table holds the origo index numbers for all 512 documents sub-blocks, represented
 *         as an unsigned short for each 128 blocks.
 *     <li>ALL: This strategy is used when a block contains exactly 65536 documents, meaning that
 *         the block is full. In that case doc IDs do not need to be stored explicitly. This is
 *         typically faster than both SPARSE and DENSE which is a reason why it is preferable to have
 *         all documents that have a value for a field using contiguous doc IDs, for instance by
 *         using {@link IndexWriterConfig#setIndexSort(org.apache.lucene.search.Sort) index sorting}.
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Skipping blocks to arrive at a wanted document is either done on an iterative basis or by using the
 * jump-table stored at the end of the chain of blocks. The jump-table holds the offset as well as the
 * index for all blocks, packed in a single long per block.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Then the five per-document value types (Numeric,Binary,Sorted,SortedSet,SortedNumeric) are
 * encoded using the following strategies:
 * <p>
 * {@link DocValuesType#NUMERIC NUMERIC}:
 * <ul>
 *    <li>Delta-compressed: per-document integers written as deltas from the minimum value,
 *        compressed with bitpacking. For more information, see {@link DirectWriter}.
 *    <li>Table-compressed: when the number of unique values is very small (&lt; 256), and
 *        when there are unused "gaps" in the range of values used (such as {@link SmallFloat}),
 *        a lookup table is written instead. Each per-document entry is instead the ordinal
 *        to this table, and those ordinals are compressed with bitpacking ({@link DirectWriter}).
 *    <li>GCD-compressed: when all numbers share a common divisor, such as dates, the greatest
 *        common denominator (GCD) is computed, and quotients are stored using Delta-compressed Numerics.
 *    <li>Monotonic-compressed: when all numbers are monotonically increasing offsets, they are written
 *        as blocks of bitpacked integers, encoding the deviation from the expected delta.
 *    <li>Const-compressed: when there is only one possible value, no per-document data is needed and
 *        this value is encoded alone.
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Depending on calculated gains, the numbers might be split into blocks of 16384 values. In that case,
 * a jump-table with block offsets is appended to the blocks for O(1) access to the needed block.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * {@link DocValuesType#BINARY BINARY}:
 * <ul>
 *    <li>Fixed-width Binary: one large concatenated byte[] is written, along with the fixed length.
 *        Each document's value can be addressed directly with multiplication ({@code docID * length}).
 *    <li>Variable-width Binary: one large concatenated byte[] is written, along with end addresses
 *        for each document. The addresses are written as Monotonic-compressed numerics.
 *    <li>Prefix-compressed Binary: values are written in chunks of 16, with the first value written
 *        completely and other values sharing prefixes. chunk addresses are written as Monotonic-compressed
 *        numerics. A reverse lookup index is written from a portion of every 1024th term.
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * {@link DocValuesType#SORTED SORTED}:
 * <ul>
 *    <li>Sorted: a mapping of ordinals to deduplicated terms is written as Prefix-compressed Binary,
 *        along with the per-document ordinals written using one of the numeric strategies above.
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * {@link DocValuesType#SORTED_SET SORTED_SET}:
 * <ul>
 *    <li>Single: if all documents have 0 or 1 value, then data are written like SORTED.
 *    <li>SortedSet: a mapping of ordinals to deduplicated terms is written as Binary,
 *        an ordinal list and per-document index into this list are written using the numeric strategies
 *        above.
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * {@link DocValuesType#SORTED_NUMERIC SORTED_NUMERIC}:
 * <ul>
 *    <li>Single: if all documents have 0 or 1 value, then data are written like NUMERIC.
 *    <li>SortedNumeric: a value list and per-document index into this list are written using the numeric
 *        strategies above.
 * </ul>
