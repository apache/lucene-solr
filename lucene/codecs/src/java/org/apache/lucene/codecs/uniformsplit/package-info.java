/**
 * Pluggable term index / block terms dictionary implementations.
 *
 * <p>Structure similar to {@link org.apache.lucene.codecs.blockterms.VariableGapTermsIndexWriter}
 * with additional optimizations.
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Designed to be extensible
 *   <li>Reduced on-heap memory usage.
 *   <li>Efficient to seek terms ({@link org.apache.lucene.search.TermQuery}, {@link
 *       org.apache.lucene.search.PhraseQuery})
 *   <li>Quite efficient for {@link org.apache.lucene.search.PrefixQuery}
 *   <li>Not efficient for spell-check and {@link org.apache.lucene.search.FuzzyQuery}, in this case
 *       prefer {@link org.apache.lucene.codecs.lucene84.Lucene84PostingsFormat}
 * </ul>
