The levenshtein automata tables (under src/java/org/apache/lucene/util/automaton) were
automatically generated with the moman/finenight FSA library, created by

The class org.apache.lucene.SorterTemplate was inspired by CGLIB's class with
the same name. The implementation part is mainly done using pre-existing
Lucene sorting code. In-place stable mergesort was borrowed from CGLIB,
which is Apache-licensed.
