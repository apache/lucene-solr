@defaultMessage Spawns threads with vague names; use a custom thread factory (Lucene's NamedThreadFactory, Solr's DefaultSolrThreadFactory) and name threads so that you can tell (by its name) which executor it is associated with
java.util.concurrent.Executors#newFixedThreadPool(int)
java.util.concurrent.Executors#newSingleThreadExecutor()
java.util.concurrent.Executors#newCachedThreadPool()
java.util.concurrent.Executors#newSingleThreadScheduledExecutor()
java.util.concurrent.Executors#newScheduledThreadPool(int)
java.util.concurrent.Executors#defaultThreadFactory()
java.util.concurrent.Executors#privilegedThreadFactory()

@defaultMessage Properties files should be read/written with Reader/Writer, using UTF-8 charset. This allows reading older files with unicode escapes, too.
java.util.Properties#load(java.io.InputStream)
java.util.Properties#save(java.io.OutputStream,java.lang.String)
java.util.Properties#store(java.io.OutputStream,java.lang.String)

@defaultMessage The context classloader should never be used for resource lookups, unless there is a 3rd party library that needs it. Always pass a classloader down as method parameters.
java.lang.Thread#getContextClassLoader()
java.lang.Thread#setContextClassLoader(java.lang.ClassLoader)

java.lang.Character#codePointBefore(char[],int) @ Implicit start offset is error-prone when the char[] is a buffer and the first chars are random chars
java.lang.Character#codePointAt(char[],int) @ Implicit end offset is error-prone when the char[] is a buffer and the last chars are random chars

java.io.File#delete() @ use Files.delete for real exception, IOUtils.deleteFilesIgnoringExceptions if you dont care

java.util.Collections#shuffle(java.util.List) @ Use shuffle(List, Random) instead so that it can be reproduced

java.util.Locale#forLanguageTag(java.lang.String) @ use new Locale.Builder().setLanguageTag(...).build() which has error handling
java.util.Locale#toString() @ use Locale#toLanguageTag() for a standardized BCP47 locale name
