    <title>Apache Lucene Spatial Module</title>
  </head>
  <body>

  <h1>The Spatial Module for Apache Lucene</h1>

  <p>
    The spatial module is new to Lucene 4, replacing the old "contrib" module
    that came before it. The principle interface to the module is
    a {@link org.apache.lucene.spatial.SpatialStrategy}
    which encapsulates an approach to indexing and searching
    based on shapes.  Different Strategies have different features and
    performance profiles, which are documented at each Strategy implementation
    class level.
  </p>
  <p>
    For some sample code showing how to use the API, see
      SpatialExample.java in the tests.
  </p>
  <p>
    The spatial module uses
    <a href="https://github.com/spatial4j/spatial4j">Spatial4j</a>
    heavily.  Spatial4j is an ASL licensed library with these capabilities:
    <ul>
    <li>Provides shape implementations, namely point, rectangle,
      and circle.  Both geospatial contexts and plain 2D Euclidean/Cartesian contexts
      are supported.
      With an additional dependency, it adds polygon and other geometry shape
      support via integration with
      <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/jts-topo-suite/">JTS Topology Suite</a>.
      This includes dateline wrap support.</li>
    <li>Shape parsing and serialization, including
      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-known_text">Well-Known Text (WKT)</a>
      (via JTS).</li>
    <li>Distance and other spatial related math calculations.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    Historical note: The new spatial module was once known as
    Lucene Spatial Playground (LSP) as an external project.  In ~March 2012, LSP
    split into this new module as part of Lucene and Spatial4j externally. A
    large chunk of the LSP implementation originated as SOLR-2155 which uses
    trie/prefix-tree algorithms with a geohash encoding.  That approach is
    implemented in {@link org.apache.lucene.spatial.prefix.RecursivePrefixTreeStrategy}
    today.
