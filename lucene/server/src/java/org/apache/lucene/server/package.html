    <title>Lucene Server</title>

    <h1>Lucene Server</h1>
    A basic example JSON/HTTP server showing how to use Lucene's APIs in a server context.
    <p>
      Features/design:
      <ul>
	<li> A number of Lucene's capabilities have been exposed:
	  indexing documents, bulk indexing (streaming JSON), block
	  joins, grouping, highlighting, suggest, live-values,
	  snapshots, etc.

	<li> Lucene's legacy FieldCache is never used; only the
	  faster, more RAM efficient doc values are used when you
	  sort, group, facet on a field.

	<li> All searching is based on near-real-time IndexReader; you
	  configure the minimum and maximum refresh times.

	<li> There is no required ID field; instead, a document is
	  identified by the pair of the searcher version and Lucene's
	  docID.

	<li> The server APIs are self documenting; point your browser
	  at http://localhost:4000/doc to browse the available methods
	  and parameters.

	<li> Error checking is strict but each error message should
	  be easy to understand, pointing to the exact path/parameter
	  that was problematic.  It's an error if a
	  request has unexpected parameters.

	<li> Write-once schema: fields must be registered up front,
	  once, before any document is indexed with them; once a field
	  is registered, it cannot be changed (write-once).
    
	<li> All changes (creating and configuring indices, indexing
	  documents, etc.) are done through JSON APIs; there are no
	  human-edited configuration files (though the server does
	  store its index metadata in on-disk JSON files).

	<li> A snapshot records all configuration (registered fields,
	  settings, etc.) in addition to the point-in-time view of the
	  index; future searches can then reference that snapshot for
	  searching.

	<li> A server thread pool handles all concurrency during
	  indexing, so a single client thread using the bulk
	  indexing API will take advantage of the server computer's
	  concurrent hardware.

	<li> Settings are divided into <em>live</em> settings, which
	  can be changed after the index is started, and ordinary
	  settings, which cannot.

	<li> Limited infrastructure for plugins.
      </ul>
