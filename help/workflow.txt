Typical workflow and tasks
==========================

This shows some typical workflow gradle commands.

Run tests on a module:
gradlew -p lucene/core test

Run test of a single-class (run "gradlew :helpTests" for more):
gradlew -p lucene/core test --tests "*Demo*"

Run all tests and validation checks on a module:
gradlew -p lucene/core check

Run all tests and validation checks on everything:
gradlew check

Run all validation checks but skip all tests:
gradlew check -x test

Assemble a single module's JAR (here for lucene-core):
gradlew -p lucene/core assemble
ls lucene/core/build/libs

Create all distributable packages, POMs, etc. and create a
local maven repository for inspection:
gradlew mavenLocal
ls -R build/maven-local/

Put together Solr distribution:
gradlew -p solr/packaging assemble
ls solr/packaging/build/solr-*


Other validation and checks
===========================

Generate a report of dependencies with known OWASP vulnerabilities:
gradlew :dependencyCheckAnalyze
open ./build/reports/dependency-check-report.html
