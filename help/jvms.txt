Compiling and testing against different JVMs
============================================

By default tests are executed with the same Java Gradle is using internally.

To run tests against a different Java version, define a property called
"runtime.java.home" or define an environment variable "RUNTIME_JAVA_HOME"
pointing at the JDK installation folder.

If property is being used, it can be a system property (-D...) or a project
property (-P...).

Example:

gradlew test -p solr/test-framework --tests TestLogLevelAnnotations -Dtests.verbose=true -Druntime.java.home=/jvms/jdk14

Note that an alternative JVM can also be made the "default" setting
by adding it to (project-local) gradle.properties.
