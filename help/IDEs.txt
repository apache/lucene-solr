IntelliJ IDEA
=============

Importing the project as a gradle project should just run out of the box.


Eclipse
=======

Run the following to set up Eclipse project files:

./gradlew eclipse

then import the project into Eclipse with:

File -> Import... -> Existing Project into Workspace

Please note that Eclipse does not distinguish between sub-projects
and package sets (main/ test) so pretty much all the sources and dependencies
are available in one large bin.
