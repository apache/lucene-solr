Gradle for Ant users
====================

This shows some common ant targets and their equivalent Gradle commands.
Examples below assume cwd is at the top of the checkout (gradlew
script available from ./). Quoted [string] gives a better or more
conventional and commonly used task alternative.

Gradle tasks apply to all modules that contain a given task name. Use
"-p" switch with a directory or a colon-notation to specify a particular
task or module. For example these two are equivalent:

gradlew -p solr/core check
gradlew :solr:core:check

List of common dev task equivalents
-----------------------------------

ant clean           => gradlew clean
ant jar             => gradlew jar          [better: gradlew assemble]

ant compile         => gradlew classes      [better: gradlew assemble]
                       gradlew testClasses  [better: gradlew assemble]

ant validate        => gradlew check
ant test            => gradlew test

ant jar-checksums   => gradlew updateLicenses [May need to run: gradlew --write-locks if changing dependencies]
ant check-licenses  => gradlew licenses     [better: gradlew check -x test]
ant clean-jars      => (NO REPLACEMENT)

ant precommit       => gradlew precommit    [better: gradlew check -x test]

ant get-maven-poms  => gradlew mavenLocal

ant idea            => gradlew idea         [better: import as a Gradle project in IntelliJ, it will build automatically]

Solr-specific targets
---------------------

Assemble Solr distribution at solr/packaging/build/...

ant create-package  => gradlew -p solr/packaging assemble

"Resolve" libraries by copying them to lib/ and other source
locations. This task should *not* be used anymore. It is added
for backward compatibility with ant (and for debugging)
but it mixes sources with output locations and this workflow
should be discouraged. Instead run assemble on packaging (above).

ant resolve         => gradlew -p solr resolve
