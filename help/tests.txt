Testing
=======

Examples below assume cwd at the gradlew script in the top directory of
the project's checkout.


Generic test/ checkup commands
------------------------------

Run all unit tests:

gradlew test

Run all verification tasks, including tests:

gradlew check

Run all verification tasks, excluding tests (-x is gradle's generic task
exclusion mechanism):

gradlew check -x test

Run verification for a selected module only:

gradlew :lucene:core:check     # By full gradle project path
gradlew -p lucene/core check   # By folder designation + task


Randomization
-------------

To run tests with the given starting seed pass 'tests.seed'
property:

gradlew :lucene:misc:test -Ptests.seed=DEADBEEF

There are a lot of other test randomization properties
available. To list them, their defaults and current values
run the testOpts task against a project that has tests.
For example:

gradlew -p lucene/core testOpts


Filtering
---------

Run tests of lucene-core module:

gradlew -p lucene/core test

Run a single test case (from a single module). Uses gradle's built-in filtering
(https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/java_testing.html#test_filtering):

gradlew -p lucene/core test --tests TestDemo

Run all tests in a package:

gradlew -p lucene/core test --tests "org.apache.lucene.document.*"

Run all test classes/ methods that match this pattern:

gradlew -p lucene/core test --tests "*testFeatureMissing*"


Test groups
-----------

Tests can be filtered by an annotation they're marked with.
Some test group annotations include: @AwaitsFix, @Nightly, @Slow

This uses filtering infrastructure on the *runner* (randomizedtesting), 
not gradle's built-in mechanisms (but it can be combined with "--tests").
For example, run all lucene-core tests annotated as @Slow:

gradlew -p lucene/core test -Ptests.filter=@Slow

Test group filters can be combined into Boolean expressions:

gradlew -p lucene/core test "default and not(@awaitsfix or @slow)"


Reiteration ("beasting")
------------------------

Multiply each test case N times (this works by repeating the same test
within the same JVM; it also works in IDEs):

gradlew -p lucene/core test --tests TestDemo -Ptests.iters=5

Tests tasks will be (by default) re-executed on each invocation because
we pick a random global tests.seed. If you run the same tests twice
with the same seed, the test task will be skipped (as it is up-to-date
with respect to source code):

gradlew -p lucene/core test -Ptests.seed=deadbeef

to force re-execution of tests, even for the same master seed, apply
cleanTest task:

gradlew -p lucene/core cleanTest test -Ptests.seed=deadbeef


Verbose mode and debugging
--------------------------

The "tests.verbose" mode switch enables standard streams from tests
to be dumped directly to the console. Run your verbose tests explicitly
specifying the project and test task or a fully qualified task path. Example:

gradlew -p lucene/core test -Ptests.verbose=true --tests "TestDemo"


Profiling slow tests
--------------------

The "tests.profile" mode switch turns on a sampling profiler during test execution,
and prints a simple summary at the end.

For example, top-10 histogram of methods (cpu samples):

gradlew -p lucene/core test -Ptests.profile=true

Alternatively, you can profile heap allocations instead:

gradlew -p lucene/core test -Ptests.profile=true -Ptests.profile.mode=heap

By default, results are computed (deduplicated) on just the method name, folding
together all events from the same method. To drill down further, you can increase the
stack size from the default of 1, to get a histogram of stacktraces instead:

gradlew -p lucene/core test -Ptests.profile=true -Ptests.profile.stacksize=8

For big methods, it can also be helpful to include line numbers for more granularity:

gradlew -p lucene/core test -Ptests.profile=true -Ptests.profile.linenumbers=true

Using these additional options will make the results more sparse, so it may be useful
to increase the top-N count:

gradlew -p lucene/core test -Ptests.profile=true -Ptests.profile.count=100

Testing against different JVMs
------------------------------

By default tests are executed with the same Java gradle is using internally.
To run tests against a different Java version define a property called
"runtime.java.home" or define an environment variable "RUNTIME_JAVA_HOME"
pointing at the JDK installation folder.

If property is used, it can be a system property (-D...) or a project
property (-P...).

Example:

gradlew test -p lucene/test-framework --tests TestJvmInfo -Dtests.verbose=true -Druntime.java.home=/jvms/jdk14
