            <p>
                Lucene project also contains a workspace, Lucene Sandbox, that is open to all Lucene committers, as well
                as a few other developers.  The purpose of the Sandbox is to host various third party contributions,
                and to serve as a place to try out new ideas and prepare them for inclusion into the core Lucene
                distribution.<br/>
                Users are free to experiment with the components developed in the Sandbox, but Sandbox components will
                not necessarily be maintained, particularly in their current state.
            </p>

                    SearchBean is a UI component that can be used to browse through the results of a Lucene search.
                    The SearchBean searches the index for a given query string, retrieves the hits, and then brings
                    them into the HitsIterator class, which can be used for paging and sorting through search results.

                    The Ant project is a useful Ant task that creates a Lucene index out of an Ant fileset.  It also

                <p>
                    The Lucene WordNet code consists of a single class which parses a prolog file
                    from the WordNet site that contains a list of English words and synonyms.
                    The class builds a Lucene index from the synonyms file.  Your querying code could
                    hit this index to build up a set of synonyms for the terms in the
                    search query.

                <p>
                    This contribution is some sample code that demonstrates adding simple XML documents into the index.  It creates
                    a new Document object for each file, and then populates the Document with a Field for each XML element, recursively.
                    There are examples included for both SAX and DOM.

                <p>
                    Javascript library to support client-side query validation. Lucene doesn't like malformed queries and tends to
                    throw ParseException, which are often difficult to interpret and pass on to the user. This library hopes to
                    alleviate that problem.

                    The miscellaneous package is for classes that don't fit anywhere else. The only class in it right now determines
                    what terms occur the most inside a Lucene index.  This could be useful for analyzing which terms may need to go
                    into a custom stop word list for better search results.
