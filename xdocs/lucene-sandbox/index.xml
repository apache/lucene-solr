<section name="Lucene Sandbox">
Lucene project also contains a workspace, Lucene Sandbox, that is open to all Lucene committers, as well
as a few other developers.  The purpose of the Sandbox is to host various third party contributions,
and to serve as a place to try out new ideas and prepare them for inclusion into the core Lucene
distribution.
Users are free to experiment with the components developed in the Sandbox, but Sandbox components will
not necessarily be maintained, particularly in their current state.
<P>
You can access Lucene Sandbox CVS repository at
<A HREF="http://cvs.apache.org/viewcvs/jakarta-lucene-sandbox/">http://cvs.apache.org/viewcvs/jakarta-lucene-sandbox/</A>.
