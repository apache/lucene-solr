<title>Jakarta Lucene - Getting Started Guide</title>
</properties>
<body>

<section name="Getting Started">
<p>
This document is intended as a "getting started" guide.  It has three basic 
audiences: novices looking to install Jakarta Lucene on their application or 
web server, developers looking to modify or base the applications they develop
on Lucene, and developers looking to become involved in and contribute to the
development of Lucene.  This document is written in tutorial and walkthrough 
format.  It intends to help you in "getting started", but does not go into great
depth into some of the conceptual or inner details of Jakarta Lucene.
</p>

<p>
Each section listed below builds on one another.  That being said more advanced users may
wish to skip sections.  
</p>

<ul>
	<li><a href="demo.html">About the basic Lucene demo and its usage</a>.
	This section is intended for anyone who wants a basic background on using the provided Lucene demos.</li>

	<li><a href="demo2.html">About the sources and implementation
	for the basic Lucene demo</a> section we walk through .  This section is intended for developers.</li>

	<li><a href="demo3.html">About installing 
	and configuring the template web application</a>.  While this walkthrough assumes 
	Tomcat 4.0.x as your container of choice, there is no reason you can't (provided you have
	the requisite knowledge) adapt the instructions to your container.  This section is intended
	for those responsible for the development or deployment of Lucene-based web applications.</li>

	<li><a href="demo4.html">About the sources used to construct the 
	template web application</a>.  Please note the template application is designed to highlight 
	features of Lucene and is <b>not</b> an example of best practices.  (One would hopefully 
	use MVC architecture such as provided by Jakarta Struts and taglibs, or better yet XML 
	with stylesheets, but showing you how to do that would be WAY beyond the scope of this 
	demonstration.  Additionally one could cache results, and perform other performance 
	optimizations, but those are beyond the scope of this demo).
	This section is intended for developers and those wishing to customize the template web 
	application to their needs.  The sections useful to developers only are clearly delineated.</li>
</ul>
