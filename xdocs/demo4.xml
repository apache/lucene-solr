<title>Apache Lucene - Basic Demo Sources Walkthrough</title>
</properties>
<body>

<section name="About the Code">
<p>
In this section we walk through the sources behind the basic Lucene Web Application demo.  
Where to find it, its parts, and their function.  This section is intended for Java developers
wishing to understand how to use Apache Lucene in their applications or for those involved
in deploying web applications based on Lucene.
</p>
</section>


<section name="Location of the source (developers/deployers)">
<p>
Relative the directory created when you extracted Lucene or retreived it from Subversion, you 
should see a directory called "src" which in turn contains a directory called "jsp".
This is the root for all of the Lucene web demo. 
</p>
<p>
Within this directory you should see the index.jsp class.  Bring this up in vi or your 
editor of choice.
</p>
</section>

<section name="index.jsp (developers/deployers)">
<p>
This jsp page is pretty boring by itself.  All it does is include a header, display a form and 
include a footer.  If you look at the form, it has two fields: query (where you enter your 
search criteria) and maxresults where you specify the number of results per page.  If you look
at the form tag, you'll notice it uses the get method as opposed to the post.  While this is 
considered deprecated functionality by the latest w3c specs, its unlikely to go away due to the
usefulness of being able to bookmark things like searches.  By the structure of this JSP it should
be easy to customize it without even editing this particular file.  You could simply change the 
header and footer.  Let's look at the header.jsp (located in the same directory) next.
</p>
</section>

<section name="header.jsp (developers/deployers)">
<p>
The header is also very simple by itself.  The only thing it does is include the configuration.jsp
(which you looked at in the last section of this guide) and set the title and a brief header.  This
would be a good place to put your own custom HTML to "pretty" things up a bit.  We won't cover the 
footer because all it does is display the footer and close your tags.  Let's look at the results.jsp,
the meat of this application next.
</p>
</section>

<section name="results.jsp (developers)">
<p>
The results.jsp had a lot more functionality.  Much of it is for paging the search results we'll not
cover this as it's commented well enough.  It does not perform any optimizations such as caching results, 
etc. as that would make this a more complex example.  The first thing in this page is the actual imports
for the Lucene classes and Lucene demo classes.  These classes are loaded from the jars included in the 
WEB-INF/lib directory in the final war file.  
</p>
<p>
You'll notice that this file includes the same header and footer as the "index.jsp".  From there the jsp
constructs an IndexSearcher with the "indexLocation" that was specified in the "configuration.jsp".  If there
is an error of any kind in opening the index, it is diplayed to the user and a boolean flag is set to tell 
the rest of the sections of the jsp not to continue.
</p>
<p>
From there, this jsp attempts to get the search criteria, the start index (used for paging) and the maximum
number of results per page.  If the maximum results per page is not set or not valid then it and the 
start index are set to default values.  If only the start index is invalid it is set to a default value.  If 
the criteria isn't provided then a servlet error is thrown (it is assumed that this is the result of url tampering
or some form of browser malfunction).
</p>
<p>
The jsp moves on to construct a StandardAnalyzer just as in the simple demo, to analyze the search critieria, it 
is passed to the QueryParser along with the criteria to construct a Query object.  You'll also notice the 
string literal "contents" included.  This is to specify the search should include the  contents and not 
the title, url or some other field in the indexed documents.  If there is any error in constructing a Query 
object an error is displayed to the user.
</p>
<p>
In the next section of the jsp the IndexSearcher is asked to search given the query object.  The results are
returned in a collection called "hits".  If the length property of the hits collection is 0 then an error 
is displayed to the user and the error flag is set.
</p>
<p>
Finally the jsp iterates through the hits collection and displayed properties of the "Document" objects we talked
about in the first walkthrough.  These objects contain "known" fields specific to their indexer (in this case 
"IndexHTML" constructs a document with "url", "title" and "contents").  You'll notice that these results are paged
but the search is repeated every time.  This is an area where optimization could improve performance for large 
result sets.
</p>
</section>

<section name="More sources (developers)">
<p>
There are additional sources used by the web app that were not specifically covered by either walkthrough.  For 
example the HTML parser, the IndexHTML class and HTMLDocument class.  These are very similar to the classes 
covered in the first example, however they have properties sepecific to parsing and indexing HTML.  This is 
beyond our scope; however, by now you should feel like you're "getting started" with Lucene.
</p>
</section>

<section name="Where to go from here? (Everyone!)">
<p>
There are a number of things this demo doesn't do or doesn't do quite right.  For instance, you may 
have noticed that documents in the root context are unreachable (unless you reconfigure Tomcat to
support that context or redirect to it), anywhere where the directory doesn't quite match the context mapping,
you'll have a broken link in your results.  If you want to index non-local files or have some other 
needs this isn't supported, plus there may be security issues with running the indexing application from
your webapps directory.  There are a number of things left for you the implementor or developer to do.
</p>
<p>
In time some of these things may be added to Lucene as features (if you've got a good idea we'd love to hear it!),
but for now: this is where you begin and the search engine/indexer ends.  Lastly, one would assume you'd
want to follow the above advice and customize the application to look a little more fancy than black on 
white with "Lucene Template" at the top.  We'll see you on the Lucene Users' or Developers' mailing lists!
